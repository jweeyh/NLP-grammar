I have just received the letter , which lets me know that I have won the first prize .
I am proud of winning it and would like to say how grateful I am .
This is because I intend to take an examination in September .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents .
It will be my first time experiencing staying there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried .
Actually , I used to play basketball for 6 years and am quite confident at it .
And recently , I have been practising tennis as a school activity .
Finally , I am wondering about what kind of clothes I should wear and how much I need .
You might not believe it but actually I helped at a pop concert last month and I really enjoyed it so much .
So I 'm now writing to let you know how great it was .
All the work I needed to do was n't very interesting . I must have set thousands of chairs correctly and after finishing I put them back nicely .
The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist during setting chairs just before they started practising .
I was asked if I wanted to sit down in front of the stage .
Naturally I agreed and I could enjoy their gig as a member of the audience .
I had ever never sat down there .
Additionally , you wo n't believe it , but the vocalist said " All the chairs you are sitting on were set out by him , " pointing at me ! !
Anyway it was so interesting a time that I did n't even feel tired after that .
Finally , I suggest you should try as I did if you have any opportunity . You are sure to like it .
Can you send me a letter back writing what happened to you recently ?
First of all I would like to thank you .
Now I am going to give you some further information : I would like to travel only in July because I am a student in high school and this is the most important year of my life . I am studying for the university entrance exams and I have to study until the end of June and then at the end of June I will have the university entrance exam and after that , in July , I am going to be alright .
I would prefer a tent because I have never stayed in a tent before and I am wondering what it is going to be like . And from these activities I will choose basketball and swimming .
My first question is about clothes ; what kind of clothes do we need to take with us ? And how much money do we need to take ?
Finally , what kind of weather is waiting for us ?
Thank you for everything .
Yours sincerely
Firstly , we got our tickets at your ticket office just one hour before the show .
We thought , as usually we do in London theatres , we could get discounts , and it 's written on your advertisement .
Surprisingly , there were no discounts .
Secondly , the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 ; it 's a theatre , not a concert hall ! ! ! !
Thirdly , we were astonished by the actors , whom we know from other musicals .
Why did you not change the names on your advertisement ?
In the end , the restaurant was closed because you did n't have enough staff that evening ! !
I have sent you a photocopy of our tickets .
Would you please return our money .
I hope we are not the only people to be so upset , but it was the first and the last time that I come to your theatre .
When her best friend , Scala , asked her for an idea to surprise her husband with because she was pregnant , Pat put her foot in it just before Scala 's husband had the surprise .
The problem is that Pat works in Neubathin , a little village .
Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years , their husbands too .
It was a sunny Friday afternoon , Scala was really excited about telling her the news .
Despite the fact she knew that Pat could n't keep a secret , this time she was confident that maybe she would be able to .
Just after Scala told her the news , Pat phoned her mother who worked in a bakery , to tell her that Scala was pregnant .
Pat 's mum was so excited about the baby , she just said " Congratulations about the new baby . "
He was so amazed and asked her to repeat .
She just remembered it ought to be a secret , and she became really embarrassed .
Scala was angry with Pat because she thought she could keep this kind of secret .
I am writing in order to complain about what you have written in the advertisement in the newspaper .
I am disappointed because of the horrible evening I have had . I was on holiday in London and I did not have enough time to spend there , but when you said that your show was the best I decided to go .
When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said none was available .
At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best I would pay what they asked .
I arrived at the theatre in time and the musical started later than I expected so I was getting irritable because I very much dislike lateness , but that was not all .
When the show started the person who was acting in it was not Danny Brook and the replacement did n't seem to be an actor .
I am let down by your behaviour .
You wanted to cheat me , so I will be very pleased if you could give my money back .
I am looking forward to your answer .
Yours faithfully ,
I think technology has changed my life and the way of life of almost everyone around the world .
First of all , technology is very useful nowadays but really I dislike it because in some ways we are becoming machines too .
Since the creation of PCs , people - and me too , of course - have been doing different things .
For example we can buy food , clothes and whatever we need by Internet or by telephone .
I can find out what is happening in different parts of the world in a few minutes .
A very good aspect of this change is that women have more freedom to work because before we had the technology they had to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave ovens .
Personally I dislike computers .
I do n't know how to use them but I know I have to change because they help to make our lives easier .
On the other hand what will happen to us in the future ?
Our lives will be managed by robots and they will replace us at work .
Something that I note about technology is that we are losing green places and there is a lot of pollution , so we have to be careful .
I received your letter and I am very glad I have won a two - week trip to Camp California .
I will give you some information which will help you to know me better .
I would like to travel to the camp in July because this is the best time for me and I hope for you .
I will be very busy in June so let me tell you some details about my trip .
Regarding accommodation , I think tents would be great .
Basketball will help the children to build team spirit and leadership skills .
And swimming is very good for their health .
I swim really well and I am a professional basketball player .
And there are a few questions I would like to ask .
First , what clothes should I take with me ? Secondly ,
how much money and should I pay by cash or by travel cards ?
Last month I enjoyed helping at the concert of " Modern Talking '' and now I want to share with you my experience .
It all started when one of the organizers asked me to help him at a concert of my favourite band .
I had taken on very demanding work . I had to bring food for Peter Bolen and Tomas Anders .
I went into their room and gave hot Cheeseburgers , Coca - Cola and ice - cream to Peter .
He asked me whether the cheeseburger was hot and I answered that it was .
He told me about a concert programme and gave me his photo with an autograph .
All the best ,
I am writing to you about the show .
I was very disappointed after the show .
First the show started at 10.15 , and it should have started at 19.30 .
After your show I wanted to visit my friends , and because of it , I could n't do that .
Also , you wrote about discounts , but it was not true !
The woman who sold me a ticket was very rude to me , actually she started swearing at me .
During the show , I was very hungry but I hoped to visit the restaurant , which was a pity , because the restaurant was closed because it was too late .
And , I forget to say something about the actors , I did n't enjoy them .
So , I hope I will get my money back . It was a very disappointing evening in my life ! I hope you understand me !
Yours sincerely
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , but I trusted him anyway .
It happened 3 months ago , and during the last few months I have been very upset .
I have a friend , his name is Peter , he is my best friend .
One day Peter killed a boy .
They were just playing and , by accident , Peter shot him .
I thought that it could only be seen by 3 people , but that was a mistake ...
We asked Pat many times to keep this secret , not to tell anyone .
For the first few days , Pat was with us all the time .
He promised to keep it secret . The next morning we had an argument with Pat . The 3 of us were shouting at each other . In short , Pat left us .
Two days later , in the morning , a policeman came to see Peter ...
So , now my best friend is a prisoner .
All the time , I am thinking about Peter .
He will be in prison for 5 years .
By the way , I haven't seen Pat for about one year .
Perhaps , he moved to another town .
It 's good that he is far away ... I miss Peter very much , it 's unfair to put him in a prison .
I am writing to you regarding the letter you sent me about the two weeks at Camp California that I won .
Firstly , I would like to travel in July because I have 2 weeks off at the beginning of the month .
For the accommodation , I would prefer a tent because I like adventure and simplicity .
Concerning the available activities , firstly , I would choose climbing because I have done it for many years .
Secondly , I am interested in trying something that I have never done , so I would like to do sailing .
Finally , I was wondering if any special clothes are required and how much pocket money I need for this trip ?
I thank you in advance and look forward to your reply .
I 'm writing to you to tell you about my experience helping at a pop concert last month .
First of all , I would like to tell you that I 've never had such a good time in my life !
The first day consisted in surrounding the site with fences .
The second day 's objective was to install the stage lights , loudspeakers and all the other stuff .
This job was quite hard , but we took our time to be not exhausted !
The last day , which was day of the concert , was absolutely fantastic .
The audience was so excited to see the concert that we had to place some bouncers in front of the stage to stop people coming on the concert floor .
Finally , the concert was exactly what the people were expecting .
I hope that the next time you will come with me !
I 'm looking forward to hearing what you think about this !
First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a great success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet .
To begin with , you wrote in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance . In fact , there were only six countries involved .
Furthermore some concert halls were definitely too small or in other words too many people attended those concerts .
You could avoid this kind of problem if you look for big halls at the outset .
Another point where you could improve is if you show more plays and films next year .
Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave the people the opportunity to attend for a whole weekend for a cheap price .
To finish this letter , I would like to give you a good idea for next year .
In my opinion it would be nice if you created an exhibition space where the guests can try to play different instruments .
Anyway the people who asked this question probably found out that it is n't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes too much work .
A traditional way to earn money , in your spare time , is to deliver newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village .
The problem that you have here is the weather .
For example when it is rainy , because then everything gets wet .
Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help with changing the film rolls , cleaning the toilets or doing some other small jobs .
But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something that you 're good at , I mean if you 're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people .
Of course in the beginning it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you 're good at it you 'll also earn some money .
I am writing with regard to your advertisement .
During my 2 weeks ' holiday I wanted to attend a musical show .
It was my favourite musical .
I was very hopeful that I was going to have a good time .
But there were a lot of things which went wrong .
Firstly , I had no discount when I paid . Secondly there was a delay which got me into trouble . After the show I could n't catch my train .
Because I did n't have any plan I decided to have lunch in the theatre restaurant .
The worst thing is that I could n't see my favourite actor .
I was so disappointed about that .
I could n't concentrate on the play any more .
In contrast to the advertisement everything was disappointing .
I regret to have to demand all my money back .
I hope you are going to be take into consideration my terrible experience .
I am waiting for a satisfactory answer .
Nowadays students have many more facilities in education than before .
These days we can use a computer , television and some sophisticated equipment , which were unusual once .
Then with technology we can reach any place in the world easily .
We can get information more quickly .
Technology has a huge effect on our spare - time activities as well .
Children play with computers instead of the usual toys .
Despite the huge advantages , technology has affected our lives negatively .
There has been a change in the relationships between people .
We have noticed the environmental damage in recent years .
While we are using technology , we should take into consideration the environment .
We should n't allow the world to be exploited .
If we want to leave a good world to the next generations , we should behave more respectfully towards nature .
I 'm an Italian student who went to the last International Arts Festival .
I think this festival is a great idea because it 's an opportunity to see and to appreciate art , but I also think there are some things that could be changed .
I noticed that the artists were from only six countries instead that from around the world .
This choice does n't give many artists the opportunity to express themselves .
There were many events and I think there were a few plays and films .
Maybe it would be better to put more of them in the programme because young people like them so much .
The very about young people , the decision to offer a reasonably priced weekend ticket is an excellent idea because it brings them to have a contact with all what it art .
I hope that my opinion can help you to organize for next year a great international arts festival alone to young people .
I think a good way to get money is to work in a fast - food restaurant .
Maybe the first impression is n't positive but , from my personal experience , I can say that this kind of job is fine for getting some money .
I worked eight hours every day , but in every fast - food restaurant you can work part - time , four , three , six hours every day .
This kind of job is perfect for young people who want to get money and at the same time have to study .
If you work in a fast - food restaurant you can work in the afternoon , or during the night , and so you have time for yourself .
Among the staff you can also find young people and have fun with them during work .
What more do you want ?
I am writing to complain about a musical show on the 10th of June , and I was very disappointed .
I was promised that the star was Danny Brock but when I was there I saw another star that was completely different from your brochure .
To make the matter worse , I had travelled to London to see this famous star but I did n't see any shows with him .
It makes me a bit angry .
According to your brochure , the show would start at 19.30 p.m. but it started at 20.15 p.m. I wanted to sleep and it was very annoying .
More than that , when I bought the ticket I did n't get any discount .
I had to pay full price .
I was promised that after the show I could go to the theatre restaurant but due to the show starting late it also finished late , therefore , when I went to the restaurant they were definitely closed .
I would like you to refund some of my money .
I paid £ 50.00 for the show . I also have a receipt to prove it .
I have a really good friend , Pat who I trusted and counted on .
I have known her for five years .
And we loved each other very much .
One day , I fell in love with my closest friend .
My boyfriend was very handsome , clever and very polite .
We were studying in the same class at school and he also knew Pat as well .
Personally , I wanted to keep it secret because I was afraid that we might split up .
And I would like to make sure that he really loved me .
My boyfriend told me that he wanted to surprise his friend in his class when the time came .
To be honest , I wanted to share this feeling with someone else but I needed to keep it very secret .
One day I decided to tell my best friend - Pat , who I relied on .
I told her everything about my boyfriend and when we met each other and eventually fell in love .
I also told her to keep it very secret and not tell anyone in the class .
On Monday morning , I walked into the class and all of my friends were shouting at me and calling my name and my boyfriend .
I was very embarrassed and I wanted to run out of the class .
I felt very angry with Pat and I should n't have told her about my boyfriend .
I felt regret but it was too late . It was n't a secret anymore now .
I received your letter and I am very excited about the camp .
I would like to go in July , I do n't mind which two weeks , but it has to be that month because in June I am still in school and in August I am going on holiday with my family .
I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I think it 's different from where I sleep every night so I would appreciate it if there are still tents available .
One of the activities I would prefer to do is Climbing . I haven't done a lot of it but I 've always found it interesting and I think this would be a good opportunity to become better at it .
The other activity I would like to do is tennis , I 'm quite good at it and I have been playing for four years .
I would like to know what type of clothes I should take and also if I need to take any money with me .
Thanks for your attention .
Hello girl , how are you doing these days ?
I have been great , especially last weekend at the Backstreet Boys concert .
They were giving two concerts , one on Friday and the other one on Saturday . They invited me to go on Friday .
This is what happened : when I arrived they told me that I was helping backstage with the scenery ; then the group arrived , we chat for like 15 minutes , then they had to go on stage .
Here is where the good part starts , I was doing the curtains ( opening and closing ) when Nick came up to me and asked me to go on stage with him . My heart started beating very hard .
Hope to hear from you later .
I am writing to complain about your show .
I would like you to return my money because that was not same as your advertisement .
In the advertisement , you mentioned actors , time , discount and facilities .
DANNY BROOK is one of my favourite actors so I decided to buy a ticket even though I had to cancel my appointment on that day at 18.30 and also notice of price discount impressed me .
However , when I got to the theatre , you not only did n't have any discounts but also had to apologize to us for the delay in starting the musical .
In addition a different actor appeared on the stage and I could n't have dinner after the musical because the restaurant was closed .
It made me so disappointed and angry .
You should return my money immediately because that night was far from perfect .
But everyone always saw from his face he had a secret .
Whenever he has a secret , his nose moves quickly .
He did not like this habit and had thought it was bad of him until he solved a big crime .
When all the money had gone from a bank , nobody was there except Pat .
The bank robbers told him if Pat told the fact somebody they would kill him .
So ,
But his nose moved quickly when the police showed him a picture of the bank robbers .
Then the police realized who the bank robbers were and arrested them .
Although the bank robbers complained to Pat , he had n't said anything to anybody .
Thanks to his habit , he is still alive and all the money was returned to the bank .
The town became peaceful again .
I 'm writing to answer the questions that you sent me in the last letter , so referring to the question of when I would like to travel , I would like to go anytime during July , because I have to be back home in August , because I need to apply and get everything sorted out , to go to college next September .
And referring to the question about which type of accommodation I prefer , I choose a log cabin , because I think that a tent is messier , so I would appreciate it if you give me a cabin .
And my answer to the question about which activities I would like to choose , well I choose swimming , because it is my daily exercise , and surfing .
Anyway I 'm not very good at surfing but with a little bit of help I know I can do it .
Oh , last I just would like to ask you how much clothing and money I have to bring with me .
And well , Mrs Helen , I would really appreciate it if you sent me back a letter with all the answers to my questions .
Thank you very very much and please keep in contact by e - mail , or normal mail .
Yours truly
I hope you are keeping in great shape , like you were the last time I saw you . How is your family ? I hope everyone is OK .
Well here in Dublin things are still the same , but I think somebody told you that I went to the Moby concert here at the Point , which is the big venue for events and concerts . I guess it was the best concert I 've ever been to , but the coolest thing is that , well do you remember my friend Luke , the one that works as a security guard ? Well he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage , so I went to help them and everything else , and when I got to the Point , do you know who was there ?
Can you believe it , it was Moby . So I went to say hello to him , and he asked me , ' Would you give me a hand with my decks ? ' So I went , and when we finished he gave me a T - shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row . Oh my God , Kim , that was the best thing that ever happened to me . Well Kim , I hope to receive a letter from you soon , and please tell everybody about the Moby concert and everything , thank you .
I am really happy to receive your congratulations .
It was a very exciting moment and a very nice competition .
And now to win first prize !
It is wonderful for me to have the opportunity to visit Camp California in the U.S.A.
In answer to your letter ,
I would like to travel in July for two reasons . One 's because I will have finished my exams by that time and the other is that in the first two weeks of that month I will go to Farnborought is special 10 days the presentation the Air show and the delegation from my country will be there .
About accommodation during these two weeks at the Camp , I would prefer a log cabin ; because maybe it is more interesting to share with other people .
On the other hand you tell me I have the chance to choose two activities while I am at the camp . But it is not easy , because all are very interesting for me .
But anyway I like more to have the possibilities for to do climbing and surfing .
Can you tell me if it is necessary to bring any special clothes . For instance if I go surfing will I need a wet suit .
Is it possible to get one there ?
The same goes for climbing . Do I need any special equipment and is it available in the Camp and what about the guide for these activities ?
Do I need any extra money ?
I would really appreciate it if you could answer these questions and saying again .
I think this topic is so exciting from the anthropological and psychological point of view , because we can study the subject 's reactions before , during and after shopping .
People in general have a compulsion to shop , in my opinion .
Because sometimes the article being bought is not really necessary . We must accept that the media have an important effect on our lives , especially the T.V.
For men and women appearance is important and they spend a lot of money buying clothes , cosmetics , accessories , jewellery etc .
And other times they sometimes choose just for the label .
Without give really importance to the quality . In reference to the appearance there is more preocupation in the food area , because people in general do n't spend time preparing food and when they go shopping they choose pre - prepared food .
We know it is easier for those with a busy life .
On the other hand the facilities for access to the shopping center are not good .
The area for parking , space for children to play or bus station near the mall are not really adequate .
Otherwise shopping would be more enjoyable .
I think in the near future we need to decide with the government
which special place in the town will be left just as a commercial area , but of course with all the facilities to get there , like a big supermarket and mall centre , from different areas of the city .
I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A MUSICAL THAT IS TAKING PLACE AT THE CIRCLE THEATRE .
I WAS WORRIED WHEN I SAW THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE MUSICAL IN A NEWSPAPER ON SUNDAY .
THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WHEN I READ WHO WAS STARRING .
BUT , WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE PLAY , I REALISED THAT IT WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR AND , REALLY , I WAS DISAPPOINTED .
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AT 19.30 AND I WAITED FOR FORTY - FIVE MINUTES ! ! BESIDES THIS , I COULD NOT GO TO THE RESTAURANT IN THE THEATRE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED .
IN ADDITION TO THIS , I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT ON MY TICKET .
SO , I HAD TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A PLAY THAT WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER .
TO SUM UP , I DID NOT HAVE A PERFECT EVENING .
TO CONCLUDE , I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK .
IN THE FUTURE PEOPLE WILL BE WEARING FASHIONABLE CLOTHES LIKE NOW .
ON THE ONE HAND , THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WILL WEAR FASHIONABLE CLOTHES .
THESE PEOPLE WILL BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE .
ON THE OTHER HAND , THERE WILL BE FEWER PEOPLE WHO WILL WEAR WHATEVER THEY LIKE .
NOWADAYS , PEOPLE ALWAYS SEEM TO BE WORRIED .
ALL THE TIME THEY ARE ASKING WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE AND THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY ON CLOTHES .
ON THE WHOLE , CLOTHES WILL NOT CHANGE .
IN MY OPINION , PEOPLE WILL ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO HOW THEIR PERSONALITIES DEVELOP AND THEY WILL GIVE UP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR .
I am writing to complain about the musical " Over the Rainbow " , which I went to see on the 16th of June .
Firstly , the actor was supposed to be Danny Brook , but he was not , it was another actor , who I have never seen before , so , as you can imagine , I was very disappointed .
Another complaint is about the time that the show started . The advertisement said it started at 19:30 , but it did not . We had to wait 45 minutes .
Now , about the tickets , there were different prices but there were no discounts , and because of this , many people could not see the show , especially students .
Finally , when the show finished , and I have to say , a bit late , I went to the theatre 's restaurant to eat something but this place was closed because the chef had already gone .
As I have explained , it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back for the reasons that I mentioned above .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , so Maria was very disappointed when she realised that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria had for him , in fact , she was so angry she could almost kill , but , she could n't because Pat was her best friend .
Maria talked to Pat about the stupid thing that she had done , but Pat refused to apologise to her , because she felt it was n't a mistake and she did it for only one reason : to help Maria to get the man that she loved .
After 3 weeks , Maria got ill so she was not able to go to school .
All her friends phoned her every day , except Pat , the only friend that Maria really loved . Despite that , she was not sad .
One day , when Maria was sitting in her bedroom , someone knocked on the door . It was Manuel . He was worried about her .
Maria was nervous , but , for the first time , she could talk to him as she never had before , and at the end of the day , she was the happiest person in the world . She had her first kiss and she had Pat 's friendship back ; after all , everything happened because of her .
First of all , we would like to thank you very much for organising such a wonderful trip with an interesting programme .
We are all extremely excited , especially because of the trip to Greenwich , the town we have always been interested in .
However , there are many other interesting places and exhibitions to see in London .
For example , at the time of our visit there is going to be " The London Fashion and Leisure Show " .
It is a coincidence which we would be extremely happy to take advantage of .
This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have autographs from .
We hope changing the excursion programme a little will not cause any problems .
Our suggestion is to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday .
Because the fashion show lasts a whole day .
We are ready to give up our shopping and free time .
Yours sincerely
They breathe , eat , feel and aside from the fact that they are famous they are just the same as anyone else .
Nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even to just a little privacy .
I personally think the best would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them , point and ask for autographs .
The biggest commercial gain in history , I believe , but celebrities are not animals although they may be sometimes treated the same way .
It may , in many cases , not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life unseparately connected to it .
To sum up , I believe that everyone has the right to keep the privacy of their own homes and even someone extremely famous deserves to have a private life .
Unfortunately as long as their private life is interesting for ordinary people and it brings commercial gain to publishers , journalists and photographers , famous people will just have to get used to this living " under a microscope " .
The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Festival I attended last weekend .
I believe that the event was good . However , I feel that the festival could be improved next year .
Firstly , I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic , but in your advertisement it said that I would find stars and artists from around the world , when , in fact , they were from only six countries .
I do understand that it must be difficult to get these people to come to the festival , but it would be nice if next year we could meet some other personalities .
Secondly , I believe you should know that a lot of people , including me , were not able to enjoy the concerts because some concert halls were too small .
I would be very grateful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year .
Last but not least , I would like you to know that I think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separately .
I hope you find my opinions useful .
Once again , congratulations on the Festival .
I hope to hear from you soon ,
Yours sincerely ,
Tips for earning money
When the holidays begin everybody is happy because it represents the beginning of a time full of fun and lots of interesting things to do , but in order to do these things we all need money and that is a big problem for most of us .
There are several ways to earn a bit of money in your spare time .
One of the most common examples is babysitting . Taking care of little children is easy and it does n't require special skills : all you need is a lot of patience .
If looking after children does n't suit you , you can try the same thing with pets .
So if you like animals this is your chance to earn some money and have fun at the same time .
The most important thing is that you choose the most suitable work for you wisely , according to the things you like to do .
Firstly , I would like to thank you for the programme that you have provided .
It is a very good programme , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which I am sure the whole class will enjoy .
However , our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and all wish to attend .
The show will be about all the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up and hairstyles .
This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style . We might also get a chance to meet new people and interact with them .
The whole class is also very excited about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a chance to go .
I have a few suggestions on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in .
We can , however , go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show .
I hope you will consider this matter .
Every day , something changes and we become more modern . Companies use computers instead of books , dentists use modernized electric tools instead of just a pair of pliers . Even homes are affected .
From letters to emails , from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves . But we are n't just going to stop here are we ?
No , in the future , the present will be the past and those things now new to us will be old , outdated and changed .
We can turn on and off lights with touch pads and remote controls .
We might even be able to open the door without leaving the living room .
Although all that may happen our houses may be still the same .
The rooms and sizes should remain as they were and the living rooms and everything may still be decorated in the same style .
We might still like that old carpet and couch .
The furniture should not change that much on the outside and the number of rooms should not change either .
And instead of going to school , why not let school come to you ? We will be learning at home using computers and discs .
They will never have to leave the house or wake up so early .
Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilities we will be using .
We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot , a machine , or something else with the same purpose .
Our homes will still be the same in terms of the cuisine . It will still be filled with vegetables and meat .
This is because people wo n't give up the great taste of food . Although it could be substituted with a vitamin pill or two .
Lastly , I think that all these changes wo n't really be noticed as we change things daily and slowly instead of abruptly .
On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London Fashion and Leisure show that we saw advertised and we are interested in .
In addition we would like to thank you for the programme .
It will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall , in London , on Tuesday the 14th of March and the suitable time will be 10.00 - 19.00
I would like to mention that on this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going shopping , so I believe it will be a good chance for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students !
The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is compatible as well with our programme because by 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping .
Secondly , I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly about what it includes .
The latest fashions will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear . Really interesting !
Moreover all about the make up and the hairstyles . I think that this show will be a great opportunity for all of us while we are in London .
But if there is a problem because the show is on Tuesday afternoon , the same time as our shopping trip , I suggest going shopping on Wednesday afternoon when we will not have anything to do !
Some people think that being a famous person is a very exciting thing , that all the time this makes you feel complete and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well .
I believe that if somebody wants fame and glory he must be totally clear about the results .
For example , politicians have chosen their careers ; they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important thing is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful about their movements or else they are going to have a bad reputation , and they will not be considered trustworthy .
Another successful career such as , film stars must also be balanced .
If somebody is a film star this means that he has got a different kind of life , a more comfortable , more interesting life but it does n't mean that he or she ca n't be like normal people even if he or she is a star .
If somebody wants to be famous of course they must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her .
But I think that there are limits .
Everybody deserves to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer .
It does n't matter what kind of career or job you have .
And finally the journalists should know how to respect the private lives of everyone and not try to make money by using the reputation of famous people .
Firstly , I 'm writing to thank you for the great opportunity you are giving us , especially in planning all this programme in such an accurate way .
I think that this programme is well - organised , as you know , because we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points .
But I was wondering , as a student of this college , if we could change part of this programme ... we 'd like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
In this way , we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and then we can go to the show .
From my point of view , we are very interested in the latest fashions like leisure wear , sportswear , make - up , hairstyles , you know ... I strongly believe that we will be in the best city and at the right time to appreciate it .
Please let me know if you agree with us !
Oh I forgot about something !
Also , this show is free ( another positive point ) .
Do you think you 've got the future in your hands ?
Do you think we 're living like in olden times ?
Would you like to live in a modern way ?
What do you expect in the future ?
Nowadays , we have all kinds of instruments for washing up the dishes , for cooking to be more convenient , for example , the TV , the video recorder , etc .
Maybe , in a few years ' time we 'll have a bigger TV , a more suitable radio but , in my opinion , I think these facts will not change our way of life . We will be able to speed up the running of computer games , for example ...
But not in any strange way you can imagine ...
I mean I do n't think we 'll change cars into aeroplanes ...
Therefore , you have to be calm because , as you know , things are developing and in the same way you 're changing , too .
In conclusion , I strongly believe that the house of the future will be the house of a new awareness . It will be a very positive point for opening up our lives .
Dear Principal , First of all , we would like to thank you for the good programme which provides us with 3 days ' stay in London .
It contains a wide range of activities , for example , sightseeing , a river trip , visiting the science museum and gallery , shopping .
The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes , such as the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up and hairstyles etc .
Moreover , students are allowed to attend for free .
All of us would like to attend the show because young people , particularly girls , are interested in fashion and make - up , so we are expecting the show to be a great opportunity to see what the new trends in fashion will be like .
It would be great if you made a little change in the programme so that we are able to attend the show .
It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th to the London Fashion and Leisure show , instead of the science museum and shopping .
Technical and Warm Home People 's way of life has been changed considerably by rapidly developing modern technology .
50 years ago , Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning wood to warm a room up and make food .
Since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented , their lives have been far easier than before .
Today , however , people do not need to spend much time on making food , washing up , or even on turning the light on and off .
Machines , such as the dishwasher , washing machine and remote control help us just to relax or do a little necessary work .
In my opinion , people 's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is built into every machine , TV , cooker and the light , connected to the owner .
A computer might know more than a human , but there are many things which it can not replace in our life .
I was enthusiastic about receiving your letter . I will give you all the necessary information .
I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work . My current post finishes at the end of June but I will start another job at the beginning of August .
I would prefer to stay in a tent rather than in a log cabin , because it would be a new experience for me and I would like to try something different .
As far as the activities are concerned , I have chosen to do tennis and swimming .
I am good at playing tennis and I have been learning to swim for three months so it could be useful training for me .
I want to thank you for this prize . Let me know if you need further information .
I 've always loved music so working at a concert was great .
You ca n't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert . Apart from the musicians and the singers , there are people who work with lights , who organize the security ... it was so exciting !
My work consisted in checking the tickets , the number on them and taking people to their seats .
Sometimes I think that people never grow up . If they had been a class of children , they would have made less noise ! !
Now I have to go . Write soon and let me know what you have been doing .
I 've received your letter and I am pleased to have won because I needed some days to relax and to leave the city , which is very stressful .
I can travel in July only because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it 's the month he can give me one , so I hope that is n't a problem for you .
I would prefer to spend the two weeks in a tent , that 's , in my opinion , a way to be nearer the environment and the animals , although I do n't mind staying in log cabins .
In spite of liking all the sports you wrote about in your letter , I am only good at climbing and sailing , because I used to do them with my father when I was a child .
I have got a doubt , it is not very important , but I would like to know if I need any money or if everything is paid for , the kind of clothes I should wear , if the weather is good or bad ... and all the extra information you can send me .
Why do people like to go shopping so much ?
In my opinion the majority of people who go shopping are women who must buy food and other kinds of things for their families , so , for them , shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated every day and that drives them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money .
On the other hand , there are people who think the opposite , such as : children , teenagers , men ; but not always , because they hardly ever go shopping - only when they need clothes , or something for their job or school .
In that way shopping can be as much fun as you want , although if you do it very often , it will be as an obligation in the future .
To sum up , everything you do in small quantities is good and fun , but do n't increase the amount you do if you do n't want to feel uncomfortable .
I was so happy to hear that I have won a two - week holiday in the U.S.A.
So if I could travel in July , and come back before the 6th of August , that would be great .
I would prefer staying in tents to log cabins .
I have never had any experience of staying in a tent , so I would like to give it a go .
I really want to learn how to swim .
I was wondering if there is a coach who could give me a lesson at the Camp .
Also , I would like to join the basketball team . I used to play basketball when I was in high school , and our high school basketball team has won many competitions during the last ten years in our city .
I am glad I have taken part in a few competitions , and I was so proud of our basketball team .
Would you tell me how much money you will give to me and what the weather is like in the U.S.A. Thank you for everything !
Yours sincerely
It was great to hear from you , haven't seen you since last summer holiday , hope everything is fine at your place .
You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping at last month ?
I must say that was great fun . I 'd never had this kind of experience before .
Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets . They were lists of pop bands and groups which would appear in the concert in order , and some information about their performance and backgrounds .
After that , I had to help people who had a ticket but could n't find their seat .
During the concert , I did n't have a lot to do , so I had a chance to see most of the performance . That was excellent .
During the break time I did give a lot of directions to people who could n't find the toilet , and gave people information such as where they could have a cup of coffee .
That was a bit boring , but it was part of my job .
I have got to go .
I am really looking forward to going to California and I would like to go in July , because I am going to have my summer holidays in that month .
About accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin , because I have a problem with my back .
Also tents are not very comfortable .
As far as camp activities are concerned , I have been doing windsurfing for 5 years and , for that reason , I am fairly interested in sailing .
On the other hand , I am keen on painting , however , I have never painted in my life , so I would like to try it .
In addition , could you advise me how much money I need for the trip ? and is there anything else I have to know ?
I received your letter two days ago and I 'm quite happy to know that you passed F.C.E. I 'm ok and let me tell you about my recent experience .
I went to Madrid last week and I was walking in the street when somebody asked me for an address .
I explained to him where the street was that he was looking for and we carried on with the conversation for a while .
Well my friend , I have to go , because I have got an appointment with the Dentist .
Write to me soon and take care .
I learnt from your letter that I 've won the first prize .
I felt how lucky I was .
I understand you want to know when I am available to set off and where I 'd like to stay .
First of all I will be able to go to the U.S.A only in July because of my university .
I will only be able to set off in July and also I will give my thesis to my teacher in August .
This holiday will help me to think about it and prepare it .
I 'd prefer to stay in a log cabin because I need a proper place to stay and study in .
When I get to the camp , I 'd like to swim and climb .
Is there a toilet and shower in the log cabins or somewhere nearby ?
Do you have any idea what the weather is going to be like ?
How much money do you recommend me to bring with me ?
Is the camp close to a town or city ?
Will you provide me with an instructor when I climb and swim ?
I haven't written to you for ages .
How is your new school and your parents ? I hope we can catch up with each other 's news .
It was unbelievable , and tiring as well .
I heard them talking backstage .
They signed my diary and had their photo taken with me .
Carrying big speakers from place to place was extremely tiring but we had loads of laughs .
Believe it or not , I put make - up on one famous singer 's face .
I was just walking down by the dressing room and the manager asked if I could help them .
I could n't believe my ears .
I was in her room helping her .
I especially liked that time .
I 've been sailing since an early age and I manage the rigging and sail perfectly .
I 'm also fond of tennis , I 've just started my lessons and would like to continue playing during the summer .
I 'm not really sure about what kind of clothes to take . Could you please write to me specifying what would be suitable ? I 'd appreciate it a lot .
For instance , I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy . We went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends ' graduation ( besides other reasons ) .
They had invited us and we wanted them to see us looking stunningly beautiful .
While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen , probably by a gypsy .
I had to buy my dress , its accessories and also clothes and souvenirs !
Dear Helen Ryan
First of all , we are happy to have won the first prize in your competition .
Thank you for choosing our ticket at the final .
We would like to go in July , because my wife Catrin just have holidays next month .
We would prefer the last two weeks in July .
Is there a chance to stay in a log cabin .
I sometimes have trouble with backache when I ca n't sleep on a flat surface .
It would be great if we could choose swimming and golf .
My wife Catrin is a local champion in swimming races .
I 'm not so good as her , but I go once every week to her training session .
At golf , we are both total beginners .
We have no experience but we would like to learn this game .
We are both a little worried . What kind of clothes and shoes do we have to take with us ?
What will the temperature be in the summer season in this area ?
Is there any possibility we could rent golf shoes ?
Finally , we would like to know when you will send us the airline tickets and the brochure .
Moreover , how much money do you think we will spend on this trip ?
We are looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely
You are interested in my last job ! I really want to tell you all about my experience .
However , I 'm happy that we have finished this hard work . I worked in a team of seven people .
We were mainly working on all the lights at this great concert .
It sounds easy , just doing the lighting .
In addition , it was nine days of hard work to mount all the different spot and hundreds of Coblights in the right place .
Finally , we worked the whole night before the concert .
We had to adjust the laser extremely carefully to get it in the correct position .
We spent hours on this till it was good enough for the technical manager .
Moreover , the band was exhausted by this great laser show in the end .
For me this adventure was one of the best .
It shows that , when all members of a group work hard together , you can achieve a lot .
With this letter I want to explain to you some problems I had last week at your theatre with your show .
First the actor was changed and his replacement 's performance was very poor and disappointing .
Then , the show began 45 minutes late , so we had to wait a very long time .
The advertisement said there were discounts available , which were not available .
Finally you said there was a Restaurant , but it was closed , so we could n't eat anything until we got home .
I hope you understand your mistakes and I 'm asking you for our money back .
I do n't know if technology has totally changed my life , because I was born with it and I have learned about it since I was a little boy .
For example , I was born knowing that man has walked on the moon .
The computer for example makes communication much easier and faster than in times past , when everything was sent by normal mail , and it was weeks till it got to the right place .
Many industries throw their contaminated air away , without cleaning it first .
Technology has to move further so it can solve problems such as pollution , so we can live better and longer .
I am very surprised to have received your letter in which you explained to me that I have won a prize in your competition .
After that , I would like to say Thanks , I have never won any prizes at all .
Now , I will answer your questions .
In reference to the date of travel , I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am working at University and I only have July to take my holidays .
As you state in your letter I have to choose the type of accommodation . I would prefer to stay in a tent because since I was a child I have been using this type of accommodation .
I used to go camping .
About camp activities , I would prefer to do basketball and photography .
I have chosen these activities because these days I am playing on the university team , and photography is my favourite hobby .
Is it necessary to bring any money ?
I am writing to you to tell you about my experience at a pop concert .
It began when our mutual friend Martha offered me the chance to help organise the concert . Obviously I accepted .
Now I can tell you that it was an amazing challenge for me because I had never done anything like that .
My duties as a staff member were various . The first day I had to pick the bands up from the airport , and for this I hired a van .
The following day I was the person who provided the meals for all the staff and also every day I was backstage supporting the catering staff .
I am particularly pleased to have known the most popular pop stars in the world .
Hoping to hear from you
I have recently been to London for a week 's holiday .
As I am a fan of musicals I went to see this show .
I am very disappointed because the things that were written in the advertisement were not really true .
It was written that the stars would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Danny Brook is one of my favourite actors and there appeared a different one .
I felt very disappointed .
The musical should have begun at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 ; this is unacceptable !
It was also written that there were discounts available and I asked about them and they said that they were n't allowed to give any discount .
As you say in your advertisement , it was not my perfect evening out and therefore I would like to have my money back .
How has modern technology changed our daily lives ?
Modern technology has changed our daily lives a lot .
On the one hand , nowadays if we have to travel to Paris and return on the same day you can take a plane without any problem .
Another advantage is that if you go on an excursion and you take your mobile phone , if you get lost somebody can find you .
I think that the most important piece of modern technology these days is the Internet .
With the Internet you can do whatever you want without going out ( shopping , speaking with a friend , working , putting your money aside .... )
On the other hand , the main disadvantage is that using modern machines can be very difficult for elderly people ; it would be very pratitable if the modern industries trained people to use modern technologies .
To sum up , modern technology has changed our daily lives a lot and this is going to continue .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
I 'm writing to you to thank you for the excellent programme for our English class in London , especially for the river trip to Greenwich . It will be a great experience for us .
But the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the " London Fashion and Leisure Show " , which will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall , London , on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 . At the same time we have to go to the Science Museum but we would all like to go to the show .
It will be very interesting for us to see the latest fashions , make - up , and hairstyles and we can speak to English people and make new friends .
So we would like to suggest how the programme could be changed .
First of all on Tuesday we will all go to the show and spend all day there , but on Wednesday in the afternoon when we have some free time we can go to the Science Museum , if you do n't mind , of course .
Please let us know as soon as you make your decision .
The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie
Thank you very much for your letter . I was glad to get it and get a lot of news about you .
First of all I want to wish your cousin a happy fifteenth birthday and wish her all the best .
I hope that it will be a good holiday for her , her family and friends .
Now about your questions , it is very difficult for me to give any advice about it . I do n't know your cousin very well so I do n't know what she prefers reading .
But when I was fifteen my favourite book was " The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie " .
So I can recommend you give her this book , because it is a very interesting , amusing , sometimes dramatic and mysterious book .
This book helps us to improve our logic , mind , and memory and it teaches the reader not to lie , to be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes that can help us very very much .
So I hope I have helped you .
Write to me as soon as you can .
With best wishes , yours
Dear Helen Ryan ,
First of all , I am available to travel in July from 1st to 20th because my university will be closed during that month .
I took up climbing five years ago and I am very keen on it .
Finally , could you tell me what I need to wear and also how much money I will spend ?
I have been asked to write a composition regarding the question , ' it is believed that shopping is not always enjoyable . '
In fact , shopping can have some disadvantages for different reasons :
Firstly , you have to queue for a long time to get a free changing room and waste time putting on some clothes when in the end they are not the right size .
Secondly , it is easy to spend a lot of money in a few minutes and you can soon regret buying all those clothes which you do n't really need .
Thirdly , some clothes can have some stains on and you haven't noticed this before buying them , so you have to go back to the shop .
In my opinion , shopping gives me a lot of satisfaction especially when I am depressed . Nevertheless it could be very dangerous for my wallet .
I 'd read your advertisement and it did n't tell the truth .
There were n't any discounts available as you 'd assured me in the ad .
I think you should check the information before printing it !
I arrived at the right time ( 19.30 ) that evening but the play , which was ' Over The Rainbow ' , started almost an hour late .
When the play began I realised that the main actor had been replaced and the new one was n't good at all .
I could n't visit the theatre after the performance because it was closed for repairs .
This is not a simple question because I have been used to dealing with technology since I was a child but I 'm going to try to explain to you how .
At that time I used the computer only to play video games .
It became essential to doing my homework .
But when we talked to the doctor we felt more relaxed because he told us that the operation was a very simple one .
I think that if my mother had got ill ten years before , she would n't have survived .
Modern technology is better now than it used to be .
I 'm writing to you in response to your letter . I was delighted to know that I won the first prize .
With reference to the date , I can only go in July , as I 'm going off on holiday in August , and I start university in September .
The place I 'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin , where I 'm sure I 'd feel more comfortable than in a tent .
The ones I 'm most keen on are tennis , at which I think I 'm pretty good since I took some classes last year , and painting , which is one of my favourite hobbies , and helps me to relax and forget about problems .
I think I 'm not bad at painting either ; at least everyone in my family likes my work , including myself .
Anyway , there are some questions I 'd like to ask you : what kind of clothes would be the most suitable for California weather in summer , and how much money do you think I 'll need ?
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Basically my work was carrying the instruments , the speakers and the lights from the vans to the stage , which is not easy work because , as you can imagine , it 's not exactly light stuff .
Anyway , I had a lot of fun working for them .
I hope they call me soon . I 'd be the happiest girl in the world if I could see them again ...
I 'd better stop now .
I am very happy to win this prize and I am going to give you some information that you need from me to ensure that I have a good time at Camp California .
I would like to go only in July because I have had my holidays booked for that month since last January .
If it is possible I want a log cabin for my accommodation because I have been suffering with my back since my childhood , therefore I need a comfortable place to sleep .
I selected swimming because it is a cure for my backache and I have not done it since I started my new job five years ago .
I also chose painting because I have never done it before . I would like to learn and moreover I want to do a relaxing activity .
Could you tell me approximately how much money I have to take for food , please ?
Yours faithfully .
Sometimes , they are happy to go shopping ,
Therefore , shopping can be enjoyable but that is not always the case .
Shopping is enjoyable when you want to give something to someone .
In fact you try to get a present to make the recipient happy .
Shopping is also good when you know what you want .
For example if you want a new track suit you know that you have to go to a sports shop but if you do n't know what you want you are going to waste your time in the shops .
On the other hand , shopping can be unenjoyable .
Shopping is boring if you go with people who are too fussy .
That is to say , they are never happy with what they get or see . They always find a problem .
It is stupid . They do not have any goal .
To conclude , I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable .
Even if I like to go shopping with some people and to some kinds of shops I will kill myself if I waste my time .
I 'm a tourist and I had a week 's holiday in London some time ago .
I had wanted to see the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented some nights ago ; and the actor Danny Brook 's performance .
I went to the theatre at 19.30 but , to my surprise , the show started at 20:15 and so I could n't remain there until the end because I had to leave London , with my group before the end of the show .
The star , the actor Danny Brook , was n't in the musical show but there was another actor , to my great disappointment .
Then , in the programme I could read about a discount available on the tickets , for groups , but I could n't get that . I could n't have all the things I expected .
That evening was terrible for me and for my friends , so I 'm not satisfied with your information and I ask for some money back .
Yours Sincerely
Some days ago , when school was coming to an end , Pat and her friends decided to throw a party for their friend , Frances , because the end of the school term and Francis 's birthday were on the same day .
That should have been a secret for Francis - and they decided on the program and the present , a new gold watch .
Peter and Sue asked Francis for some help with their exam subjects and Francis , all week , was too busy to help them .
The last day all the friends went to Pat 's home with food , musical instruments , and a tape recorder .
In the afternoon she had phoned Francis 's mother and she told her the secret , then she phoned her best friend and she spoke about that again ; she phoned many people all day .
Now a lot of people knew the secret but Pat told everyone : " I will tell you a small secret , but do n't you speak about it , please ! "
When he was out he needed to buy some cigarettes so he went to the shop where the owner , his friend , asked him if he was very happy about his present , the new gold watch , he was very lucky to have best friends like Pat and her friends .
Francis discovered the secret !
Now none of Pat 's friends tell her about their secrets because Pat is n't very good at keeping secrets .
I went to your show called " Over The Rainbow " and I was really disappointed by many things .
Firstly , you spoke about two actors , Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but instead of them we had two others and they were really bad .
Moreover , in your advert you wrote that there were discounts available but it was not the case .
Then you invited people to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because there were no staff to welcome people .
You offered something you could not possibly provide .
I did not have a good time for all of these reasons and I would like you to give me my money back .
I hope you understand my request and you are going to reply as soon as possible .
I thought she was a really good friend but I made a mistake .
She did n't tell me but when I came to the class everybody was looking at me and this boy as well .
I looked at her and she became pale and suddenly left the class .
I followed her and caught her to push her to the ground .
My Mum was at home and I told her the whole story .
She said that I had to be strong and not care about them .
So I went to the class and everybody was laughing at me and the boy told them to stop because he loved me and wanted to be with me .
Then all the girls became jealous and stopped laughing .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
It is a pleasure to write to you and we want to thank you for organising a school trip to London .
We have seen the programme and we all think it will be enjoyable .
Especially to the science museum because we are all doing science in school .
Recently , some students have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show in London . It will be on the 14th and we all want to go .
So , it would be great if you could give us this opportunity to watch the show .
This is a great opportunity to learn something new because most of us have not been to this kind of show and it is free for students . It will be incredible if we have a chance to watch the show .
We can also suggest how the original programme can be changed .
So we can go shopping instead .
Then , we can go to the show during that period .
We are all looking forward to your answer .
sincerely
Because there was a man who had had a serious car accident and I was walking past him .
I was thinking ' what should I do ? ' I had n't got my mobile phone with me and I was halfway between my school and home .
At that time he was unconscious . I kept asking myself ' Should I wake him up or try to use my dubious first aid skills to help with him . "
I decided to do something for this man . My first move was to check whether there was any solid or liquid which could have blocked his airways .
And I checked his body condition .
After that I turned on the car 's lights in order to warn the passing cars .
I phoned the police and told them the whole story .
A strange thing happened to me , when I got back to that man .
Oh , sorry they were not on this road . They were on the next road .
I just received your letter with the good news .
I am very happy about winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go , but I can only travel in July because I have to work until the end of June .
Regarding the accommodation , I would like to have a log cabin rather than a tent because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy .
I am an average swimmer and as a singer I am not a beginner and it would be fun to share my songs with the holiday makers .
Can you please give me some recommendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to plan my budget .
In my opinion shopping is sometimes really boring , especially when you buy the same things at the supermarkets almost all the time , like cleaning products and the ingredients for everyday recipes .
On the other hand everything looks different if I have to get a present for someone in my family .
I start thinking about what she or he prefers and I try my best to buy something appropriate no matter how much money it costs .
In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort into choosing things and making decisions and they are more or less important , or more or less enjoyable depending on what , why , where and who is the person that you are interested in pleasing .
I AM WRITING WITH REFERENCE TO THE LONDON TRIP WE ARE MAKING VERY SOON .
I AM WRITING ON BEHALF OF MY GROUP , AND ALL OF US WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR TAKING US ABROAD .
WE HAVE SEEN THE ACTIVITIES PROGRAMME ALREADY AND WE THINK IT IS EXCITING , ESPECIALLY THE VISIT TO THE SCIENCE MUSEUM . AT THE SAME TIME , WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING .
THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW IS GOING TO BE ON THE 14TH OF MARCH , FROM 10.00 TO 19.00 .
WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS SHOW .
EVEN THOUGH YOUR PROGRAMME IS PERFECT , WE WOULD PREFER TO GO THERE .
WOULD YOU PLEASE BE SO KIND AS TO CHANGE SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PLANNED ?
WE THINK IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY , BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW , WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT KIND OF SHOW IN THIS CITY .
IN CASE YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE THE PROGRAMME , WE SUGGEST GOING TO THE SHOW ON TUESDAY AND ON WEDNESDAY , INSTEAD OF FREE TIME , VISITING THE SCIENCE MUSEUM .
WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR ANSWER .
YOURS SINCERELY ,
THAT NIGHT , I WENT TO A PUB IN BAYSWATER .
WHEN THEY CLOSED , I TOOK THE NUMBER 7 BUS .
I WAS LIVING QUITE CLOSE TO PORTOBELLO ROAD BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THE AREA VERY WELL BECAUSE ALL THE TIME I JUST HAD TO GET OFF AT THE CORNER OF MY STREET . BUT THAT DAY , AS I WAS KIND OF DRUNK , I DIDN'T REALISE THAT THE BUS TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE . SO , WHEN I NOTICED IT , THE DRIVER WAS ALREADY ASKING ME TO GET OFF , BECAUSE WE WERE IN THE GARAGE IN PORTOBELLO .
I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS , BUT HE JUST SAID SORRY .
I WAS REALLY SCARED .
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE AROUND BUT I WAS AFRAID TO ASK THEM THE WAY .
FINALLY I ASKED A BOY AND HE SAID " I'LL TELL YOU WHERE THE PLACE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS , JUST FOLLOW ME " .
AFTER FILLOWING HIM FOR 10 MINUTES , I STARTED TO RECOGNISE THE PLACE , AND I WAS FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE .
HE TOOK ME RIGHT TO THE FRONT OF MY HOUSE .
I THANKED HIM VERY MUCH , AND I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I ASKED THE RIGHT PERSON AND NOTHING BAD HAPPENED TO ME .
First of all , it was written in the advertisement for the show that the main actor would be Danny Brook , but a different actor played in the show .
The show started forty - five minutes late and this really disappointed me .
Besides , when I bought the ticket , I found out there were not any discounts for tickets , while you wrote the contrary .
Definitely , it was a very disappointing evening and I would appreciate it if it is possible to have my money back .
That was why she decided to change her behaviour .
She was given a chance : if she was able not to tell everybody a secret for a short time , her friends would start trusting her .
The secret was about a surprise party for her best friend 's birthday .
As soon as the arrangements for the party started , she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her best friend .
But , as the days went by , she was surprised because she realized she was getting used to not telling secrets anymore .
All her friends were amazed at how she had changed and started trusting her at once .
I am writing this letter to you , because the show " Over The Rainbow " , which is London 's newest and best musical show , was not ... for me .
Please excuse me , but there were many mistakes and problems on the note you have made , which disappointed me very much .
I thought that Dany Brook , who is my favourite actor , would perform in that show .
Please , if you would be so kind correct this mistake . I would be grateful if you could correct too that show starts at 20.15 not on 19.30 .
Another thing was that there were no discounts available , and that the restaurant , which I wanted to visit after the show , was closed because of the main cook sickness .
That evening , which should have been my perfect evening out , was in fact very tiring and boring .
I am looking forward to your reply !
Best regards !
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . I knew that he 's a very talkative person , but it was necessary because I wanted him to be the main organiser of that birthday party for tenes .
Pat found a great place for the party called " Blue Box " .
I made beautiful invitations for all of Agatha 's friends with a note : " Do not tell Agatha about this . This is a surprise party for her . Please keep the secret ! " Pat arranged a great DJ and drinks .
My friend and I made the perfect decorations with balloons and other party stuff .
Everyone told us it was breathtaking .
Everyone gathered in the disco at 21.00 .
We were only waiting for Agatha , who was expected at 22 o'clock with her boyfriend .
It was so exciting ! ! !
We turned off the lights and then the door opened and I just heard " What the hell is going on ? ! ! "
Anyway the disco was great , music also .
We had fun until 5 o'clock !
Agatha said that it was the greatest present she could ever receive !
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I attended your festival and I would like to give you my suggestions for it .
I must say that the International Arts Festival is really a great idea .
And your last festival was very interesting too .
But also there are some notes that you should improve in next year 's festival to make it absolutely wonderful .
First of all , you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world , because there were people only from six countries .
Your dance shows are very beautiful , the art exhibition is something original and exciting .
I think that one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because it is n't so expensive as buying a ticket for each event , and with this ticket you can visit everything you want .
I hope you will continue holding your festivals .
Yours faithfully ,
I must say that the rules are n't the same in the schools of our country .
Every school has its own rules .
We are all very friendly in our class and we help each other when we have a problem .
So the main rule in our school is regarding teachers .
And the main reason why our family is so friendly is because we haven't got many rules .
So , I think there is n't anything I 'd like to change .
Regarding your letter dated the 6th of June I 'm so happy to receive the first prize .
The reason is that we have long holidays at school at that time .
Although the accommodation is n't so important for me , I would prefer the log cabin because of the comfort and the better bed .
I have chosen as my activities surfing and photography .
I 'm a beginner at both activities .
I have the following questions :
2 . What do I have to pay myself ?
How is the weather in California ?
Yours sincerely ,
Most of the time shopping is fun and enjoyable .
There are a lot of reasons why it can be awful to go shopping .
I once had this problem .
The sales assistants in the stores are n't so nice or helpful .
Sometimes they give me a bad feeling like , , customer treat with order " .
Last week I was shopping with my younger brother . Awful !
He wanted everything that his eyes saw .
All the stuff for children is on the same level as their eyes .
Afterwards , I felt tired and unsatisfied with the store .
When I feel in the mood for shopping everything is closed or I haven't enough time to look around .
My conclusion on these points is not so bad . I like shopping only with my best friend .
I 'm very happy that I won first prize in your competition .
Two weeks at California in the USA is the thing I dreamed about a lot .
The only time for me to visit you is July .
I can come to USA in July because in August I will be working with my father .
What about accommodation ? I prefer tents to log cabins .
Nights in hol . in July are hot .
A tent will be cooler to sleep in than a cabin .
You offer a great variety of activities .
I always watch the NBA matches on T.V. It will be great for me to do basketball in the USA .
I have questions too .
How much money should I take with me and what sort of clothes are required ?
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
Ten or fifteen years ago we had empty shelves in shops in Poland .
People always queued for stuff from the west .
It was the worst side of shopping in Poland a couple of years ago .
Nowadays we have capitalism , free market , lots of private shops , markets and supermarkets .
We can buy everything we imagine .
Polish supermarkets are not Polish - origin shops .
They are imported from another Western European country .
I appreciate these shops for lots of products , cheap prices and big spaces .
On Friday evening and on the weekdays all supermarkets are crowded .
They are filled with people who want to buy everything .
I am writing in reply to your letter in which you told me I have won first prize in your competition .
Now I am answering your questions and then I would like to know some further information about travel and accommodation .
I would like to travel in July because in June I am going to take some exams at university and at the moment I do not know the exact date .
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I am not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent .
As regards the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp I would like to do painting and photography .
I paint in oils from life and my subjects are landscapes , people , animals .
I also like taking photographs , for example during my journeys or trips .
Would you give me some information about me clothes to wear there ?
I would also like to know how much money I can bring .
There is somebody who says that ' Shopping is not always enjoyable , ' and who is happy only when he can go shopping .
First I do not think that shopping is enjoyable when you must do it in a hurry or as a duty .
If you have to run from one shop to another , always looking at your watch , going shopping is a terrible activity .
On the other hand if you can walk around without any time problem with a good friend I think that shopping is very enjoyable .
For instance , it is fun to enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a T - shirt although you do not buy anything .
To sum up I enjoy wasting money whether buying useful things or not .
I often like buying gifts for my relatives and friends .
In my opinion , shopping is relaxing , above all on Saturdays when you have finished a working week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday .
I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT I AM THE winner OF THE COMPETITION ORGANISED BY YOUR COMPANY LAST MONTH .
IT IS VERY PLEASING TO KNOW THAT I HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEND TWO WEEKS AT CAMP CALIFORNIA IN THE USA , WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE .
ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING TRAVEL TIME , ACCOMMODATION PREFERENCES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH I LIKE TO DO .
WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS FOR THE WHOLE OF AUGUST SO THE ONLY ONE VACATION MONTH I CAN GO IS JULY .
CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP , PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED . I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE OVER ALL . REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY .
I JUST STARTED TO PLAY TENNIS . THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS .
PEOPLE LIKE DOING SHOPPING ( ESPECIALLY IN POLAND , WHERE MANY NEW AND MODERN SUPERMARKETS HAVE BEEN OPENED ) LADIES PREFER TO VISIT UNDERWEAR SHOPS OR DEPARTMENTS IN HUGE HYPERMARKETS AND MEN ARE HAPPY WHEN THEY CAN BUY SOMETHING NEW FOR THEIR CARS , MOTORBIKES OR COMPUTERS .
PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD LIKE GOING TO DO SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS OF FAMILY ( IT 'S EASIER TO CHOOSE THE REALLY NEEDED THINGS FOR KITCHEN OR BATHROOM , TO GET SOMETHING TASTY FOR DINNER , LUNCH OR BREAKFAST ) .
THEY CAN SAY , , SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE '' BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD FROM CATALOGUES OR IN THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON THE CORNER .
THEY ARE TOO LAZY FOR WALKING AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR GIRLFRIENDS .
ON THE OTHER HAND - IT 'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO SIT AT HOME , CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDER .
PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE SHOPPING HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS FOR THIS SITUATION ( MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE SHOP ASSISTANT , BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE , HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN SHOPS ) .
ANYWAY EVERYBODY SHOULD DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT , NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE .
BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN CHOOSE THE WAY TO DO IT .
IT ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON LIFESTYLE , PERSONALITY AND NEEDS .
Thank you very much for your recent letter .
I can not believe that I won the first prize ( it 's great ! ) and , of course , I am very happy .
As for your questions , I am free to travel only in July because I will have my holiday after finishing the exams .
And , I have to return to my university by August .
I prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I am not used to narrow spaces and feel more comfortable with a place like a bedroom .
Furthermore , I prefer to do painting and photography as my hobbies and my fascination for art and enjoy taking photographs of wildlife .
Finally , please could you give me an idea what sort of clothes to bring ? And how much will I spend there ?
Also , please advise me regarding any things it is necessary to prepare and bring .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Sorry I haven't written to you for such a long time , but I 've got a good excuse !
It was a big one and I could n't have imagined how amazing it was .
I did n't know what was my responsibility until they called me to be trained .
What a surprise ! And unbelievably , I was responsible for looking after the pop stars .
But , I got through it . I had to take care of them during the break , serving drinks , clothes , I even brought them some cigarettes and anything they wanted .
I think they are so hospitable and warm with people around them . You know , because of this all my opinions about the self - important behaviour of superstars have changed .
What I most appreciated was that they gave me their latest CD with their signatures . Marvellous thing ! And of course , as you have seen , I 've given one to you .
I hope you 're well and enjoyed the CD and do n't forget to write back all about your news from during your summer holiday job .
I am a foreign student who is on holiday here .
I am going to stay here for a week .
I 'm sorry but I am very disappointed with the show .
I would like to describe to you my experience because I want you to give me my money back .
Last Monday , I went to the theatre with two friends .
We arrived on time but the show was delayed until half - past eight .
Moreover , we were n't given any discount for being students .
Furthermore , the main actor was changed for another and nobody told us .
When there was an intermission we went to the restaurant which was closed because it was late .
Well I believe that it was a bad day but I would like you to give me my money back because in the advertisement there were some things that we did n't have in the theatre .
Finally , I would be grateful if you could answer me soon .
Yours sincerely ,
When I was a child I had different entertainment to those that modern - day children have .
We could play with our toys , dolls and we could enjoy ourselves without a computer .
We had n't so many machines as they have .
It 's very important but sometimes it is a bad thing because the children can see it too .
We can find information about the weather and sports on our TV - text .
On the other hand , science is changing .
We have more researchers than a few years ago and we will be able to find the solution to lots of problems .
Actually , we can cure illnesses which were once very dangerous .
I 'm sure that in a couple of years we will see some illnesses like cancer and UTH cured .
I 'm writing to you in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival .
I spent two days there , and I think it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been to .
I also hope that the festival could be even better next year .
The great idea of making it " international " was unfortunately not brought to life , because the artists ( said to be " from around the world " ) were from only six countries .
Maybe the reason for that is very simple : lack of money ?
It would explain why some concert halls were simply too small - you just could n't afford bigger ones .
On the other hand , the wide range of plays and films to choose from impressed me the most .
I also thank you for the excellent idea of having one ticket for all events , which allowed me to see all the things I was interested in .
If you really want to hear about school rules in my country , I 'll try to write about them briefly .
We do n't have to wear any special uniforms or signs of our school .
Some rules are really simple : we must be at school on time , and we must not disturb others during classes .
In winter we are to change our shoes .
It may sound funny , but mud , gravel and snow lying on the school floors is not a nice sight , so we change our shoes without questioning that rule .
I am also used to writing exams which are very often in Polish schools .
Yours faithfully ,
Dear Ms Ryan
I am writing to find out further information and give you some details about myself and the trip that I have won in your competition .
First of all , I would like to inform you that I am able to travel only in July because I am a student and in June , I will still have school .
Also , in August I will be studying a summer course in English .
Because I would like to stay somewhere which differs from my home and everyday comforts , during these two weeks .
However , in your letter you mentioned some activities . I would choose Basketball and Tennis .
I have been playing basketball in a team in my town for ten years .
Also tennis is my favourite hobby and I play twice a week with my friends .
Finally , I would be grateful to you if you would tell me about clothes and money .
Will we need any special clothes and how much would you suggest I bring for these two weeks ?
I am very well . I 'm writing to tell you about my experience with the pop concert last month .
First of all , I think that I helped them .
I was going to markets and to schools and I was giving out information about when and where the group was going to appear as well as where people could buy or book a ticket for this concert .
I know it was difficult and tiring but I enjoyed it a lot .
Firstly , it was a good break from the usual routine .
Because I was doing it for the first time .
Also , I felt wonderful when I saw that the concert was a success and every day it was crowded .
Because I believed that this was a result which came about with my help .
I would like to do it again in the future .
All the students are very pleased and we are looking forward to going to London .
We know we are going for only three days , but we 'll have enough time to see one of the biggest cities in the world .
London is the place to be because there is always something happening .
We are all very happy with your programme , we especially like the idea of going sightseeing by ourselves and visiting the National Art Gallery .
The students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , and we would like to ask you if it is possible to make some changes to the programme .
The show is on Tuesday 14th between 10.00 and 13.00 .
We think it is a great opportunity to see the latest fashions , and find out about make - up and hairstyles .
And all of it is free .
According to your programme , we have the Science Museum which is in the morning and then shopping .
Would it be possible to go to the Museum and then go shopping in our free time , which is on Wednesday ?
All the students would be very grateful .
Yours sincerely
I think for all of us home is something which is very important .
We call home the place where we live or the country where we come from .
Anyway home is always the place to go because it is ours , we feel safe and comfortable there .
After hard work , we want to go home to have our corner where we are able to rest and relax .
We live in a very busy world !
Working long hours , doing plenty of activities , going out , going on holidays .
We do n't even spend time with our families .
Probably in the future we may be too busy to go to our own home and spend some time there .
But at the end of the day it will always be the place to go ! We find our family there and our life .
Some of us have been living in the same house since we were born .
We are sentimental and we have memories from the past . I think it 's a part of our life .
I am writing to complain about the musical show ,
First of all , I would like to have seen Danny Brook as I am keen on his acting .
He did not perform that evening .
In addition , although you advertised that discount tickets were available , they do not sell them any more according to your staff .
Finally , we went to the restaurant in your theatre after the show .
It was closed because of the staff training .
Unless I hear from you within ten days , I shall have to take legal advice on this matter .
It is believed that our lifestyle has been changed by modern technology such as computers and washing machines etc .
I have found it very expensive to buy them but there are a number of advantages .
First of all , dishwashers are very convenient for me because I work full - time and look after my children .
He complained about that a lot .
Secondly , computers are useful for us as well , because we do not need to go somewhere if we want to get information , for example about travelling .
However , my family members do communicate with each other less than they used to , because my children are keen on playing computer games .
In my opinion , modern technology makes our life easier .
It is very good for us but I think we should think more carefully when we buy something for our children .
Last week I was on holiday in London and I went to the theatre for entertaining but I wish I 'd not gone there because everything went wrong .
I bought a ticket at the box office but there were not any discounts for students like you said in the advertisement for the show and also the show was meant to start at 19.30 but on that day it was delayed about 45 minutes .
During the show I expected to see Danny Brook , who is my favourite actor , and Tina Truelove .
There were Robert Alan and Jack Ruby instead of them .
After the show finished I wanted to visit your restaurant and I found that it was closed .
There was a sign in front of the restaurant : " sorry we are closed for special reasons " . And I was wondering what the reasons were for that .
Finally , I would like to have a refund for my ticket because it was a horrible evening .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . That was why our great plan for our holiday was not be real .
It happened last summer . We planned to go on holiday in the southern part of Thailand by motorbike but we could n't tell our parents because they would n't allow us to go .
We started our journey and we arrived at our destination by 6 o'clock in the evening .
The sun was shining and the wind was blowing like we had imagined .
While I was standing on the beach , suddenly I heard someone call my name and say that I had to go home . That is right , it was my mum .
She told me Pat had phoned her while we were leaving and my mum followed us because it was so dangerous to go by bicycle .
Even though we could spend our holiday there but with my mum and I just found that it was fantasy time which I had never thought about it .
From now on , I do n't want to tell Pat anything secret because she always tells someone else but she is still my best friend .
I am writing in reply to your letter I received yesterday .
At the beginning I would like to answer the questions you asked me in your letter .
The most suitable month for me to travel is July because my boss promised to give me this month off ( I am in charge of a project which starts in June so I am sure I could n't go later ) .
' As I have a choice I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions .
Last year I took part in a photographer 's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in the category of , , beautiful scenery '' .
Climbing , in contrast , is something I started a few months ago , so I have not gained any success in this sport .
But you could give me a chance to get more familiar with it .
I would also like to know what the cost of spending two weeks in the U.S.A. is .
I want to thank you once more for taking me into consideration in your competition .
Have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want , looking through shelves and not finding that in the end .
There are a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping .
You could also buy something which later turns out to be broken .
Moreover , you could face an aggressive and maybe even drunk shop assistant or manager .
But at home you notice that there is a tear on the sleeve .
And you could n't of course take it back because the price was lowered and your dress is not under guarantee .
I would like to complain about the show which you presented last Saturday .
It was such a disappointing evening out with my friend during our week 's holiday in London .
We have had a quite pleasant time except for that evening .
These are some points I want to mention about the differences between what the advertisement said and the realities .
First , I had a great expectation to see Danny Brook playing his role , but he had never shown up that night .
It was such a disappointment .
Second , it only started at 20:15 .
It was 45 minutes later than it was supposed to be .
It was so boring to wait for the show in a noisy and hot theatre .
Third , there was no possibility of a discount .
The girl who sold the tickets was laughing at me when I mentioned about how the discounts availability was written in the advertisement .
Fourth , the theatre restaurant was closed .
There was a note on the door saying that painting was going on that weekend .
Finally , the sentence that was written on the advertisement was absolutely not true .
It was the most imperfect evening out I ever experienced .
I hope that you can provide a better service next time , and this time you need to give back the money we paid .
Since I moved to London to study English I have had a hard time making intimate friendships with people around me .
It took quite a long time to adjust to the multi culture in the language institute .
Even if I could meet some friend , I could n't express my heat to them because we have different backgrounds and our first languages were different .
I really wished to have a friend with whom I could share everything that is going on in our lives .
She was such a wonderful person in our class .
She tried to help others when they had a difficult time at school .
One day she realized that I was always outside of the circle .
Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together on the weekend usually .
We had a fantastic time together for three months .
We could even make a trip to Paris in the school holiday !
I thought that I had found a good friend in my life .
There were some stories I never told anyone before , but I shared with her all my secrets .
A few days after I told her about my secret love story , it became top gossip among my classmates .
I wonder if it is all right to come at that time .
And concerning my accommodation ,
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin , because it is more comfortable .
I would like to relax there and enjoy the atmosphere in which I will be living .
Before I came to England , I swam every weekend in my country , even in winter , so I choose to do some swimming and sailing while I am at the camp .
Actually , my mind has already gone there . I ca n't wait even for a minute .
By the way , I would like to know about the shopping , especially for clothes . I want to buy some for myself .
Lots of students normally have classes in the morning .
And sometimes they do something in the library by themselves in the afternoon .
For instance , reading , looking for some information or using the computer .
Moreover , some foreign students hope there will be some English classes that focus on the examination .
Start some part - time foreign language classes for the students who are interested in them .
Let foreign students do more exercises about English to help them pass the exam .
Use the equipment and space that we have to organise some activities .
I am writing to thank you for your letter confirming that I won the first prize in your competition .
I would also like to give you some information about me in order to arrange the details for the trip .
First of all , I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only during July because in June I am going to sit examinations for the First Certificate in English .
Furthermore , in August I will be preparing for my course at the university where I am starting next September .
Secondly , I would be grateful if you could arrange accommodation for me in log cabins as I am not used to staying in the countryside and especially not in tents .
In addition , I would like to inform you that I would prefer to do Surfing and Sailing while I am at the camp , as I am an active member of the Sailing and Surfing Club of Manchester and it will be a great chance for me to practise my techniques and skills .
I would also be grateful if you could send me information about the average cost of living in California , as I have to work out the amount of money that I am going to spend , and some advice about the clothes that I need .
I would also like you to specify if the food is included in the prize .
As requested , I visited some classes during lessons and some other rooms while activities were taking place .
The aim of this report is to make a series of suggestions on which lessons and other activities should be filmed .
It seems to me that it will be an extremely good advertisement for our school if you take plans from the chemistry lesson in the laboratory , because our laboratory is new , recognised as one of the best in the area as it has a huge amount of equipment and really some very good teachers , and also many experiments are taking place in this laboratory .
Furthermore , I think it will be a good idea to take plans from a match of our school team on the football pitch as it is completely new and fully equipped .
In addition , I think you also have to take plans from the school 's nursery as there are a lot of facilities for the children , and the parents can see that the teachers are very good .
I also think that it will be a good idea to take some general plans of the school area as there is a huge background .
In conclusion , I have to declare that I and my fellow students will be available to help with this short video by all means .
I am delighted to receive your letter saying that I have won a two - week holiday in your recent competition and it will all be paid for in advance .
I am writing this letter so as to give you the information which will help you to organize all the necessary details of the forthcoming holiday .
I would be grateful if you could arrange a date after the 20th of July , due to problems beyond my control .
I would rather stay in one of the log cabins as I am allergic to many plants and insects and I should avoid coming into contact with them .
As I am very interested in photography and swimming I am hoping to take part in those activities .
I came second in last year 's swimming competition and I have enrolled in photography classes .
On the camp I can practise them a lot .
Could you please let me know as soon as you receive my letter ?
But I have finally got around to writing and you 'll see that it 's definitely been worth waiting for as I have some great and unbelievable news to tell you .
As you know I 'm on half - term school holiday and have plenty of time to do many more things apart from studying my A - level history , such as meeting up with my friends , visiting interesting places or even going to the cinema on my own .
However , this term has been a far cry from the others .
You will see why I 'm describing it as the most unforgettable one when you read through my letter .
A couple of days ago I bumped into my best friend , who is into music , and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing .
She invited me to the rehearsal of a huge concert by a singer who is a well - known pop star as well as my favourite .
Can you believe that I was introduced to him and I took numerous photographs , some of which I put in the envelope .
Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it was one of the days I will never forget throughout my whole life
Write to me soon .
The trip that you have planned for us students is a great chance to meet new people and visit a beautiful city .
Your programme is excellent because it tries to offer the students the best way to spend their time without wasting time with silly places or events .
We 'd like to thank you because this kind of event shows how dedicated you are to our school and the students that study there .
It 's especially great to visit the Science Museum , because of its exhibitions .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday .
It 's a great opportunity for us because there will be exhibitions of the latest fashions , of the new hairstyles , and of the new leisure and sports clothes and people teaching how to apply make - up .
In this way , the leisure time would be on Tuesday and we would be able to go to the London Fashion Show .
Thanks for your attention and we 're waiting for your answer .
Yours sincerely ,
Famous People & the Media
Famous people are special in the eyes of the rest of society .
Nowadays , the media is expanding its means of communication so they need more information . The media is starting to encroach into the private life of these famous people .
It 's important to respect other people 's lives because it can cause serious problems for the family of the person or in his life .
If the famous person does n't mind being filmed in his personal life there 's no problem .
But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacy the media has to respect that .
Everybody likes to be with their family without any reporter or photographer hanging around .
In summary , the best thing to do is try to extract from these people their best qualities and not try to find things that could irritate them like family problems or personal problems .
Respect is essential .
They deserve to have a private life like any ordinary person .
Dear Sir / Madam
I 'm writing to you to complain about the musical show that I went to last evening .
I had a week 's holiday in London , so I wanted to spend my last evening with great pleasure , however it was the worst evening in my life .
Second , the show started at 20:15 , although I read that it would start at 19:30 !
Moreover , after watching the show I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant , but it was closed , it really disappointed me .
Yours faithfully
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
Fifty years ago people did n't even think that after 2000 years they would have another life .
When Thomas Adison invented electric light , it was the greatest invention for people of that century .
And nowadays modern technology can change all our lives .
I mean , almost everyone now has a car , a computer , a mobile phone and even an airplane .
First of all , now I can phone my friends and parents from every place , I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the Internet .
Second , modern technology helps me in the kitchen .
Cooking has become faster with the help of the microwave .
What is more , modern technology prevents different illnesses .
Furthermore , yesterday I heard that every man could fly into space without any experience , it is great , from my point of view , that in the year 2050 everybody will fly into space .
On the other hand , people can atrophided of all these inventions .
They become lazy because they know that they can sit on the sofa and change the channels on the TV by pressing a button .
In conclusion , I want to say that in spite of this , I hope that in future we will have more and more new inventions and they will prevent our disasters and problems .
First of all I would like to thank you for the good programme you have organised for our trip to London .
The sightseeing by bus , in particular , seems to be very interesting .
But we would like to suggest something to you : there is a trendy event about the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up and hairstyles , on the 14th of March .
It is called " The London Fashion and Leisure Show . "
This would be a great opportunity for us because we are all interested in clothes , sports and fashion .
I almost forgot to mention that it is free for students !
Unfortunately we have noticed that on the 14th we are already visiting the Science Museum .
Our question now is : could we go to this show ?
We would all prefer to go to the show ; free time is not so important for us .
Yours sincerely
Therefore I read Agatha Christie 's " Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie " .
I can really recommend this book to you . It is fabulous .
One story is about ten people who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island .
Suddenly a murder takes place !
There is also Hercule Poirot , the famous detective , and he finally solves the mystery .
But I will not tell you any more .
Thank you for telling me that I have won the first prize and now I am writing to give you the information you have requested .
First of all , I think I would like to travel in July , which will be the only month when I will be able to go .
I think sleeping in a tent is more fun than other .
Also , during my stay at Camp , there are two activities I can choose . For one of them I will choose Basketball because it is the sport I play most . I and my friend used to win the first place in the school - wide match when we were at school .
And for the other one , I think painting will be a good idea ; painting is one of my hobbies and I 've been studying it since I was 5 years old and now I 'm still doing it when I have some free time .
Above is all the information you asked for . However , there are some things I 'd like to know ; the first is about the clothes . What kind of clothes do I need to take with me ?
And another question is what are the prices of things like there , which I want to know so that I can make a better budget for my trip .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Thanks for your last letter ; I knew you would be interested in my experience of helping at the pop concert last time . Now I will tell you about it .
The place where we worked was a football pitch ; we spent 3 days setting up the stage , the equipment , and the lights .
In fact , there was nothing very important I did , because we were not the right people to do it .
I only put the speakers in the right places , or helped the engineers test the lights .
But in the breaks and after work , I had a chance to talk with the engineers , and I learnt something about setting up the equipment .
The fourth day , the singers and the musicians were there to test .
From that , I learnt more about the instruments .
Finally , the day of the concert came .
After the concert finished successfully , I was happier than ever because the success included my work and that was the most enjoyable moment in my life .
According to your advertisement , it is LONDON 'S NEWEST AND BEST MUSICAL SHOW , but I was deeply disappointed with it .
According to your advertisement , the stars were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE .
I decided to go to see this show because of its stars , but on the day I saw it , a different actor performed .
Moreover there were no discount tickets .
You should have said there were very few .
It started at 20:15 , forty - five minutes late !
That 's why I could n't have dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show .
It had already closed when the show finished .
Could you give me a satisfactory reply as soon as possible ?
In particular , the computer has changed my daily life dramatically .
It is only two or three years since I started using a computer at home , but now I wonder how I could live without one .
I open my mailbox every night .
Before using e - mail , I used to write letters and sometimes used the telephone .
However , I 've found e - mail is better than those means of communication .
Because as soon as I send my message , they receive it .
In other words , I can also receive their reply quickly .
It 's really useful when I need a quick reply .
Moreover when I send e - mail , I do n't need to worry about the time .
Thanks to modern technology , I enjoy chatting with my friends in other countries and my family in Japan almost every day .
I am writing to complain about the show , " Over the Rainbow " , which I saw in your theatre last week .
Secondly the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes doing nothing .
I also thought that there should have been discounts for students , which in fact were not available and I had to pay the normal price .
Furthermore , the restaurant in the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay .
I had to go home without eating dinner , though I was really hungry .
If I had known all of them , I would have changed my plan and could have had a better time .
I strongly suggest you give us the right information .
I would also like to claim a refund for the evening .
If you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago , you 'll notice that there are incredibly big differences between them .
But in what way ?
For example , they 'll wear clothing which protects them from air pollution , sunshine etc .
Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouths and noses like we have sun - glasses , and that all the masks are designer brands , which are made of a special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air .
It 's like a joke , but a bit scary .
Imagine that all the people have hats with broad brims to protect their faces from the sun , and it 's the trendiest fashion of the year !
I recently had a holiday in London and went to your musical show ' Over the Rainbow ' but found it very disappointing .
It said in the advertisement that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
However , there was a different , unknown actor in that .
The show started late , at 20:15 , which was very different from ' 19.30 ' as shown .
There was no discount at all , which was in contrast with ' Discounts Available ' .
After the show , I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed for no reason .
The real show is really very different to what is described in the advertisement .
The fashion in nowaday clothing just keeps on changing .
Although some may appear again after a few years , different styles are developed .
Concerning the fashion of the future , I think it depends on people 's personalities and they develop their own styles which suit them the most .
They can wear different kinds of clothing , like they design for themselves or those like history can wear those of Victorian times and in different countries .
As for the colours , I think metallic colours , especially silver , will be the most popular .
As different kinds of fabrics will be invented and the clothings will never be just cotton as always been seen .
Maybe paper can also be a fabric used to make clothing and for those who like to wear new clothes every day .
They can be thrown away after wearing them and are light enough to be carried around whenever you want to change what you 're wearing .
Dear Mrs. Ryan ,
First of all , I would like to say that the only month available for me to travel is July .
I finish my classes on the 25th of June and August is reserved for going with my parents to France .
This was scheduled 3 months ago .
About accommodation , I would prefer the log cabins because I think they are cleaner than the tents .
While I 'm staying there I would like to practise tennis and basketball , as I have been playing both sports all my life , and I have to say that I am very good at both .
For men , sometimes it is hard to go shopping with their partners .
The sports shop .
You can not waste time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive .
And that is always what we want .
Another point is to go to a big area .
Specially at weekends .
People should have to get a licence to drive those things .
A huge queue that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out .
In conclusion , for me , to go shopping is not enjoyable at all .
I 'm writing to you inform you about the disappointing evening I had when I went to your theatre to see the play called " OVER THE RAINBOW " .
According to the advertisement you published , there should have been some important differences to the production I saw .
Secondly , in the advertisement it said that discounts were available but there was no discount on the tickets I bought .
Furthermore , I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there were on holiday .
In addition to this , I have to tell you that it was the most horrible evening I have had and because of this I want to ask you if you could send me a refund for part of the money I wasted there .
I would be grateful if you could do that .
Finally , I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theatre to cheat your customers . If you do that , there will be no business for you and no satisfaction for them .
I look forward to hearing from you
Yours sincerely ,
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
It affects everyone who lives on this planet and every activity done on it .
In this instance we are going to focus on me :
Emilio Almodar , 18 years old , University Student , and the career I have chosen is in International Commerce or Market .
I use technology every minute but I did not realise .
For example , when I come back home from university and I call my friends , I am using it because at home we have very modern phones and a fax machine and almost everybody in my family has a cellular phone and things like that .
We also have five computers , the latest models , because they are useful for my father to work on and for me to do some special projects for University .
These machines are connected to the Internet , and that gives my family too much access to all the information we want , from how to prepare a drink to what was the result of Sunday 's football match .
In addition to this we use the net to communicate with some friends we have in the U.S.A. It 's really amazing .
Apart from this , I do n't spent my free time using technology .
I prefer playing rugby and going out with friends , because technology is not all of life , but it is only a little part of it .
On my first day in London , I saw your advertisement which was very interesting to me .
But I was really disappointed by it .
Also , it was certain for me to be able to buy a discount ticket because I am a student .
But , it was not possible .
Second , I went to the theatre at exactly seven thirty in the evening .
However , the show started 45 minutes later .
I wasted too much time waiting .
It was not good for me , because I had only one weeks holiday in London .
Moreover , the theatre restaurant was closed with the word " Staff vacation " on the front door after the show .
It was totally different from your leaflet .
Could you give me half of my money back ?
I think the people will wear convenient clothes with a simple design in the future .
And they will use soft cozy fabrics like cotton and silk .
However , if they have some special day like an important public day or special day of their life , they will wear very different kinds of clothes which you have never seen before .
Some of that will be very strange to our eyes , but some of the others will be familiar to us .
And they will use most kinds of things like small stone to diamond etc .
Maybe some people will be naked .
Just imagine the future people 's way of life .
And you can see their clothes also .
The only time that it is possible for me to travel is July , because I am working for a bank and this is the only month I can go on holiday .
For my stay in California I would prefer the accommodation in tents because this gives me a feeling of freedom and adventure and it is quite different to my life here in Greece .
The activities I would like to do most are climbing and surfing .
In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say that I am quite good at climbing .
But I have never ' surfed ' in my life , so that is an activity I have to learn .
Last but not least there are some things I would like to know : What kind of weather do you have in California ?
How much money should I take with me ?
And my last question : how many people are going to stay in each tent .
Yours sincerely ,
If you go to the centre of any big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat .
First of all because of the great variety in the store .
Very often you do n't know what to buy because we do n't have only three or four different sports shoes to choose from , no , we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike , Adidas or Fila .
Another problem is that shops and stores are often overcrowded .
And many people are in a hurry , so do n't be surprised if other people do not have the tolerance and patience to wait and hit you with their shopping trolleys .
Of course there are a lot of other reasons why shopping is n't always great fun , but the last reason , which is very important for me , is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal .
That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores , where no one has time for you to help you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for you , no one to talk to and no one to complain to .
That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in small stores , where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complain about .
I am writing in reply to your letter . I am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
About the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because I have got a new job and I ca n't ask for more than one month of holidays each year and in the other months I will be very busy because my workmates will take holidays in these months .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer a tent because it is more appropriate to a camp .
And regarding the activities , I must choose Photography and Painting because I am not very good at sports and I think I do well at these things .
Finally I just want to ask you what kind of clothes I have to bring with me , and approximately how much money do you think I will need ?
Yours Sincerely
Here I am , writing to you to tell you everything about my wonderful experience at the concert .
You ca n't imagine how much I enjoyed that journey .
I started early in the morning , helping to carry stuff from the trucks to the place where the band played . I helped with the musical stuff like speakers , mics , lights , sound equipment , etc .
And I helped them fix the last details .
When the concert started , I was preparing some drinks for the band because after the concert they would be very tired and thirsty .
After the concert I only helped tidy up the place and made sure that everything was under control and clean .
But the thing that I particularly liked was that I could do all kinds of things just in one day and I could feel different emotions .
So , that 's everything that I can tell you . I enjoyed it a lot and I hope to have another experience like this .
It was a surprise to learn that I won the first prize .
The reason I am really writing , however , is to give you some details about my trip to California .
In the letter you said that the accommodation provided can be either a tent or a log cabin .
I would prefer to stay in a tent so that I will have the chance to be in contact with nature as well as the scenery around the camp .
The activities I would like to choose from the activity list are singing ( because I belong to a choir at school ) and photography .
I 'm really good at taking pictures . It 's a way I have to express my feelings .
I wonder if you could send me more information about what kind of clothes we have to bring .
What a surprise it was to get a letter from you after all this time .
In order to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the city , the County Council organised an open air concert .
The pop band " Five " arrived in town and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also with building the stages and sound .
I could n't believe it when he said : " O.K. , if you want to help , here is a list of what you can do . "
My job was to leave some leaflets in shops , restaurants and on the streets .
What I really enjoyed was being part of the staff .
Although I was very nervous , I knew I could do the job well .
I 'd love to hear all your news . Why do n't you come and visit me ?
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to express my disappointment with the play " over the rainbow " , which is showing at the Circle Theatre .
Surprisingly , he never appeared on the stage during the play .
Secondly , the show started one hour and fifteen minutes late .
We arrived at the theatre on time and we had to wait all that time until the show began .
Finally , when I asked about the discounts , an aggressive employee refused to answer me .
The evening was a horrible surprise , completely different from what was promised in the advertisement .
Definitely , I want my money back as soon as possible .
" I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told her everything about Lynne Harter , our new classmate at school .
Well , that was the beginning of my tragedy .
So , I told Pat that Lynne was ugly , fat like a cow , and extremely aggressive .
But I could n't shut my mouth . I continued : " You ca n't believe it , Pat , she wears trousers like a man and green flowery blouses . " Of course , my friend and I were laughing for half an hour .
Two days later , when Pat came back to my school , she met Mr Harter , our head teacher , she told him everything about Ann1 .
At precisely that moment I realized that I had forgotten to tell her that Ann was Mr Harter 's niece .
But , well , the unhappiness started with Pat and my revealed secrets .
I 'm writing to complain about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I recently saw this in your theatre during my week 's holiday in London and I must say I had a very disappointing evening ! I was sure this was London 's newest and best musical show , the best I would ever see , because of the good publicity you gave yourself in your advertisement , but I thought completely wrong !
Firstly , the play started nearly an hour later than I expected !
If the show had been beautiful , I would have been quite happy to wait .
Then , I had read that there would be discounts available , but that was n't true !
It 's better not to write anything if it is n't true .
Finally , I hoped that , after these incidents , I would enjoy myself , but there was another change to the programme : the star !
After the show , I went to your theatre restaurant , but it was closed and this had n't been said before .
Moreover , I was shocked by the reason for which it had been closed : the chef left after he received a phone call !
For all these reasons , I want to ask for my money back and I hope to hear from you soon !
Organise your shows better and do not exaggerate with publicity !
There could be many things to say about this .
Technology is a wide field which expands very quickly .
I 'm not sure if I can say whether technology has changed our life in a positive way or not .
Nowadays , we can make a phone call with an astonishing rapidity , whereas in my grandparents ' time it took one month or more to get in contact with people abroad , because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow !
When the first car appeared , it was already a great success .
Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America , Australia or wherever else they want !
What can I say about television ?
It allows us to maintain connections with the other states of the world , improves our knowledge , offers us news , advises us about events which have happened or will happen .
In , the not very distant , 1914 , parents sent their sons to war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead !
Despite this , I 'm convinced all this progress has caused some damage to the community , not only physically .
We have become passive people , we follow the same routine every day and we live in a society where rules are strongly fixed .
I think everyone should live his own life how he wants to live it and make himself known for who he is , not for his money , but for his abilities , his good habits , his personality .
Finally , everyone should slow down his own life 's rhythm .
I was very excited at the idea of going to the theatre , but it did n't work out as I thought it would .
First of all , the starring actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . Tina did act , but Danny Brook was replaced by an awful actor whose name I do n't recall .
Second of all , the play was supposed to start at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 .
I 'm not used to wasting my time sitting on a chair waiting , I do have better things to do with it .
Another thing I want to complain about is that you advertised that discounts were available , but there was n't any discount at all .
To finish my " marvellous " evening , I wanted to eat at your restaurant , but it was closed and no reason was given .
Now you 're probably asking yourself what does that mean , well , now I 'm going to explain it to you .
I was having some family problems , so my marks were going down and down .
One day she looked me in the eyes with a sharp , deep look , never have I seen such a deep look , and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to .
It consisted in stealing the school list from the computer , in other words , hacking into the school software .
I thought it was a great idea , so I stole about ten tests we were scheduled to do .
I was punished , nearly expelled , but Pat did n't receive any punishment .
I never accused her of lying , and if you ask me why , I really do n't know .
According to your advertisement I could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all .
The show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 .
I had to wait in the overcrowded hall .
When the show finally started I found out that Danny Brook had been replaced by another actor .
One of the reasons for my visiting your show was Danny Brook 's participation .
To make matters worse , the restaurant which was mentioned in your advertisement was closed .
So I did n't have such a perfect evening as was promised in your advertisement .
In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisement and I would be greatful if you could give me back a part of my money .
In my opinion , modern technologies play an important role in people 's lives .
I think that at present the most important technologies are computer and internet technologies .
Both computers and the Internet influence people 's lives .
I have to use a computer every day .
It helps me with preparing my homework .
First of all the Internet gives you access to a great number of different information .
On the one hand , the Internet is often used for entertainment , but on the other hand it 's also used in different business and education processes .
With the help of internet technologies I communicate with other people from all over the world it gives me the chance to improve my English .
In my view , the Internet can be used in education , because it gives an opportunity to have remote communication between pupils and teachers .
Though the Internet has a lot of positive aspects , I think you should be careful with it and not be dependent on it .
At the beginning I would like to thank You for Your letter - it pleased me much .
If we are talking about accommodation then accommodation in tents would be great - I love being close to nature .
I would also like you to know about my two hobbies : swimming and surfing .
I am not talking about some kind of achievements in those disciplines but they are my big passion
I hope to have a chance to practise both of them at ' Camp California ' .
There is also one thing that I would like to ask you about .
Unconnected part of all people 's lives is shopping .
We buy everything from clothes to food and the only thing that could stop us from this is money .
As a teenager I must admit that there is nothing more enjoyable than shopping .
It 's like , , walking in the clouds , , you feel like you are flying .
Choosing gives me such great pleasure because I never have to worry about where I get money for my wishes .
All I have to do is buy and choose .
I think that , , having is a dream '' for all of us .
It 's hard for me even to imagine a situation when shopping is not enjoyable .
Probably it is one of the moments when you want something badly and you ca n't have it .
Everybody knows that , , present presents a problem '' You know your own taste but what about the taste of the other person ?
However I ca n't agree with the opinion that , , Shopping is not always enjoyable '' I think that everybody likes to buy but not everybody likes to take pleasure in it .
