People have had a need in communication since the dawn of time .
Every human being has a need in socialising and that is the first reason why I believe we start making friends .
Personally I usually get on with people pretty well and make new friends easily as I am a natural extrovert ( or so I think ) .
It usually starts with small talks or compliments , as at school I was taught that expressing appritiation to people can be a good start of any kind of relationships .
A true friendship itself forms on a base of strong mutual understanding and this takes a good deal of time .
Friends do not have to share the same opinion on every topic , however , they should respect and support each other even if they disagree .
Mr Smith was found on the floor with next to him a glass , which was completely broken .
I thought that he must have called the reception for some wine , as the waitress said that every night after he had eaten , he always drank a glass of wine .
All night the body had lain like this on the floor .
The next day the waitress knocked once , twice , three times but no one answered , so she thought that the man might have gone out .
In fact I discovered that Mr Smith 's nephew wanted all his fortune .
Sometimes people will do anything for some money
Nowadays it 's believed that it 's better to work on your own than to work as a group .
First I completely agree with this but then when I started to think about it I realized that it 's not like that .
Firstly I think that if you work as a team you can help each other and if you have more people to talk about any situation you could have a better and more completely answer because you have the ideas and the knowledge of every single member of the group .
Secondly I think that the members of the team give you support , love and company .
Sometimes the members of a group began to be so close to you that you love them the same as if they were part of your family .
Moreover if it is a really nice group it is funnier to work with them than to work alone .
In conclusion , I believe that it 's better to work as a team than to work on your own because they give you love , company and you could pass a very good time
It is well known that an image is better than a thousand words and that may be the reason for the success of television in a recent survey as the most important invention of the last 100 years .
However , this election could not be the wisest as there are other inventions more useful than television and with better future applications .
I am referring to the Internet . Born in the 1970 's as a military project to interconnect the missile facilities and the central headquarters , it soon spread to universities and educational centers .
This fact , along with the spreading of personal computers , quickly became in a generalization of its use in the first decade of the XXI century .
For more than 50 years it has been the main entertainment channel displacing others as radio , theater , cinema and , sadly , also books .
In its first years television was also an important channel to culture ( theater plays , classic films , etc . ) .
Unfortunately , in the last years television has lost this educational focus .
The Internet , on the other side , has became more and more popular not only for entertainment but also for business and today is almost impossible to find an activity in which the Internet does n't play a major role .
The Internet has also replaced television to watch films and TV shows , especially among young people who prefer to download and watch the videos instead of watching on the fixed schedule of TV .
This experience is unbelievable and unforgettable to me .
It was in winter 2002 when 2 friends and me were working in a hotel in a village called Tignes .
At about 8 p.m in the evening on December 12th , my friends and me went back home .
It was the end of a hard work 's day so we went to bed early ; we were very tired and we had forgotten to put out a candle .
One hour later our table was on fire .
Monica and me called out her name and we slapped her face .
At the moment , some friends and other workers who lived on the same floor go into the bedroom .
At the beginning , we could n't stop the fire , and although this night sound impossible , we managed to put out the fire .
Public transport has been discussed enough but there is always space for further discussion .
Now the question uder discussion is whether public transport has future as travelling by car is gaining more and more popularity because of its advantages .
Well , I think it has future .
First , there are always lots of people who would prefer not to give much thought where to park their car or how to avoid traffic jams .
In smaller towns without underground there are usually a number of bus routs to cover the city area , so , all you need is to go to a bus stop and to get on a bus and soon you 'll reach the destination .
It 's not a secret that gas , insurance and reparings are costly .
Safity issue is very important also .
It is obvious that is safer for the environment than thirthy cars with an only person inside .
You should take into account that thirty drivers(often inexperienced or aggressive ) pose a greater danger to road users than than one trained bus driver who feels responsibility for his passengers and for other participants of the traffic .
The answer is evident , I think .
And the last but not the least thing is that there are quite a lot of people who are not able or just do n't want to drive , so the only way out for them is public transport .
Moreover , cities ' authorities encourage development of public transport because it creates employment , lessens impact on the environment and contributes to road safity .
So , my opinion is that public transport does have the future . Travelling by car is convenient but public transport has undeniable benefits for long lasting life as well .
Michael taught that he could use his father 's car , and borrow some money from his mother .
He knew that Peter was a little bit irisponcibile , but he taught that the arragement sounded perfect and nothing could go wrong .
He was thinking that this time it would be different , everything was planned and they will have a great time .
She 's gotten used to receiving those short messages every day .
No name of the author on it , but let 's face it - there was only one guy on Brooklyn who would wake up every day before the dawn , no matter if it was raining or snowing , and run like crazy to Alison 's family small flat .
Occasionally her older sister would watch her down from the hall and poke her index finger on her forehead . " What a jerk " she 'd mutter under her breath .
Thomas was one of those guys that every gal had wished to be around with .
He was handsome as hell , well - build and a true gentleman .
He worked hard at the docks to make a good living with his mother .
She lost her job when war started , as well as her husband - Tom 's father .
Back then it was pretty obvious that regardless his young age of seventeen , he would quit school and start earning money .
Try to fit a heart and bravery of a lion into a small frame of sixteen - year - old girl .
Her major health problem was asthma , as well as anemia , low immune system and underweight .
Credits to the last one , she 's skin and bones with almost no muscles .
All her clothes are from kids section and yet they 're usually too loose .
But there 's something in her big bright eyes , circled with long brown eyelashes and frecles , that makes her appearance unique and causes Tom 's heart to flutter every time he brings to his mind her piercing stare .
Alison 's sister , on the other hand , is a total opposite .
The only thing they have in common are eyes , taken from their mother .
Rest is anything but completely different .
That 's why Mary is constantly surrounded with a bunch of fellas meanwhile Tom is the only one to follow Alison and have her back .
This flick stands out from low quality versions because of its accurate details .
The film , instead , was shot in central Italy and surprisingly the scene of the balcony hasn't even been filmed in Verona .
The young bridegroom then is involved in a brawl and banished from the village .
The acting of a classic is undoubtedly a difficult task , and yet Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting play their role very convincingly .
However the water is dirty and it is recommended to clean the pool at least twice a week .
The gym is nice and comfortable , but newer machines should be bought to replace some of the machines that are actually in use .
Also the court is cheap and the changing room is nice and clean .
On the other hand the opening hours are not enough and they should be extended .
Is advisable to paint the walls with a brighter colour .
Apart from the above mentioned points , there maybe so many other ideas which can make a big difference to the club .
Back then when she had been a little kid , she had dreamed of seeing the entire world .
The woman had smiled to Alice and had given her some words of advice , " Young girl you lose something important to you .
Alice had looked on confusion as the woman had been walking away .
Alice had gone through the entire world , from the hottest desert to the highest mountain .
However , when she had arrived there had n't been anything but a barren desert .
She had been shocked .
Sadness stroked her heart .
It had been told that anyone who stepped through it would be cursed , but Alice 's willingness had been stronger than her fears .
Finally , after much time travels , Alice had this feeling .
That girl , indeed was Alice herself in her youth .
Has you told me that I will win some literary competitions and that some people will speak well of me , I would n't have believe you .
The year was 2012 and I had n't written anything until that day - I just had been translating some stories and once even subtitles for a Korean movie from English and Spanish .
But that day - it was on spring and I believe it was Thursday - my English teacher told us about a literary competition .
The theme was ' I visited the Earth in2112 ' .
It sounded like a quite good challenge for me so after finishing the then lessons I quickly sat down and started writing .
And when I wrote down the last sentence I immediately sent it to the stated email .
Only then I realised that there is nothing more to do , that I have to just wait .
First days I was a little bit nervous but day by day I started forgetting about any competition .
But a month ago my mobile phone started to ring .
I picked up and heard nice woman voice .
And that voice told me that I am a winner of a third place !
So happy was I !
That moment a bit changed my life because I 've started to write more and more stories .
And the more won competitions , the more proud was I of myself .
Since I was a child , I had been curious to know how stuff works .
Through the years , my interest in machines and electrical devices increased , so whenever a device stops working I tries to fix it before calling the maintenance , and my parents always encouraged me even when I broke it down .
When I was in secondary school , and my friends were dreaming of be Doctors or Dentists , I decided that I will be an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer , so I entered the scientific branch .
During my study , my parents and I noticed that I understand kinetic physics more than electrical physics .
Also , I was good at mathematics subjects that related to solid geometry , that is why I decided to study mechanical engineering .
Since I enrolled in the faculty of mechanical engineering , I had a goal to complete my master study in Europe or America .
After searching and asking , I found Germany has numerous prestigious technical universities , and it offers great study atmosphere for foreign students and supports them in many ways .
For those reasons , I am convinced that Germany is the best country to complete my study abroad .
Therefore , I have decided that I am going to continue my postgraduate study and pursue a Ph.D. degree to work as a teacher at a university .
I have been looking for a while for suitable university to apply to .
First , I like the curriculum of the mechanical engineering master program .
Second , TU - Clausthal has very good rating in engineering at many websites like ranking.zeit.de .
Finally , TU - Clausthal located in fascinating nature .
I hope that I get the chance to complete my study at your university and to gain practical experience in one of the greatest industrial countries in the world .
A lot of different languages are spoken in all over the world , and it is not easy to choose one of them to learn it .
my view is that nowadays English is an important language that it is necessary for almost everyone , so I will choose to learn English first .
The most common reasons to study a language are the job and travelling .
Although in some places people do n't speak English , you always can find somebody who does .
Even though you have to study vocabulary and expressions , the grammar is easy to understand and you can be able to do simple sentences in a few days .
Whereas there are a lot of options , we rarely start learning other language before we can communicate well in English .
Their transformation from innocent posters to digital screens ranging in size from miniscule to vast has made adverts all - pervasive .
Multimedia , advertising and entertainment companies now work in synergy to target everyone from toddlers who can barely speak to pensioners confused with the speed of life in the new age , unsubtly playing on their needs and desires in order to turn them all into faithful consumers .
They have so successfully infiltrated their own product into our everyday existence that we no longer see it anymore as what it really is : a nuisance .
Creators of adverts have long given up on informing the consumers and instead opted for seducing them .
The result are insincere , misleading and often deceitful messages that our minds are saturated with .
Perhaps it is time to do an experiment and hit a pause button and reflect upon this subject matter .
Would it be bleak and boring and leave us at a loss as what to buy , or might it just turn out to be a long yearned for respite ?
As a matter of fact Venice could be a very good candidate for hosting the marathon competition , which will last one day
Moreover Venice is one of the most beautiful cultural cities in Italy .
The marathonetscoming before or staying after the competition can take the advantage of visiting the city , which offers a great deal of facilities
Public water buses and private water taxis run 24 hours a day although less frequently at night .
Despite the private service is very expensive it is efficient .
Four and five stars hotels are located in the main area , but smaller hotels and a youth hostel are also available to families .
In addition to this there is a significant lack of evening entertainments in the city such as theatres , cinemas and night - clubs .
On the contrary participants will find a wide range of restaurants , trattorias and bars with a good selection of menus suggesting local food .
In conclusion I think there will be no obstacles and objections to host this sporting competition in my town which on the other hand is also a cultural event for many of the participants .
I read your email yesterday but I had n't had the time to reply yet .
I helped catering the staff and during the concert I was free to walk around wherever I wanted because they gave me a security badge .
I had asked if I had permission to stand in front of the stage during the main concert and the organisation agreed .
I do n't think so ..
After the show I had the chance to meet the band members .
Here is a picture from the last summer when we were in Halland on an island called Nidingen !
In my family we are five people , my mom Malak , my dad Claes , my little sister Novalie and my little brother Edvard .
I compete in skiing and I think it 's very funny . I often go skiing in Åre , Vemdalen and in Ramundberget .
Once every year I ski with my ski club ( Täby slalomklubb ) in Switzerland .
In Zermatt you can see the mountain Matterhorn ( the mountain that you see on toblerone package ) .
In the summer holidays my family and I just to be at the vest seaside on a small island called Kålhuvudet .
That is one of our summerhouses I love to be there because when we are there we swim in the ocean and we fish crabs and just have a really fun .
You can of course see the ocean and it is very beautiful .
My parents call me a shopaholic and I almost agree . I like it because it is fun to look at clothes and try them .
I read pretty much and my favourite book is Harry Potter .
If it was possible to go on Hogwarts I would do it .
Now you know what my favourite book is so you can almost guess what my favorite movie is … Of course Harry Potter .
But I do also like a movie called The game plan .
It is about an American football player who does n't know that he has a daughter and one day the daughter came to his apartment .
Then it is a fun and fantastic story that I do n't want to say because then it is not going to be fun to see the movie .
I do n't see movies only I look at some series to .
For example Pretty little liars and Modern Family .
Pretty little liars is a little bit scary but I like it .
Modern family is my favourite series .
I like it because it is very comic .
My favourite song is a song called Chandelier with an artist called Sia .
It is a girl called Jasmine Thompson and she sing cover songs and I think she is a really good singer .
I do also like a song called classic with an artist called MKTO .
One band I like is One direction I think they sing really good .
When they were in Sweden I was on their concert and after that my voice were almost gone .
But there was really fun to be there but is what pretty cold , because on friends arena the roof was open .
My favourite food is sushi or a fillet of beef with potatoes and béarnaise .
I like sushi because the combination with fish , rice and soya makes it delicious .
I like beef and my favourite is a fillet of beef with béarnaise , it is a very good combination .
My favourite restaurant is a restaurant called dahlboms in Åre because they have the best spaghetti bolognese ever .
Hope you enjoyed your reading , I think this is what you maybe want to know about me !
Micheal tried to hit the door with hammer , but it was useless because that door was made of steel .
Snugly Micheal heard steps coming towards to him .
He opened his eyes again when the steps were faded away .
Michael felt himself strangely , because he was n't feeling walls around him .
He felt like he is about to die .
The moment he reached the light everything changed .
Micheal seemed to be really happy in this moment .
Suddenly Micheal opened his eyes and he realized it was just a weird dream .
It was amazing event !
Local people were invited and a talent competiton was held .
Number of people exceeded my expectations !
Generally , bands played great , but of course there were also terrible singers in the competition - but it did n't matter so much .
I 'll never forget the sounds and smiles of these happy people with their arms in the air who were standing under the stage .
On a Charity Fun Day the air was filled with the fabulous smells of Indian , Italian and many other world cuisine .
Unfortunately , not all of the food was tasty , so one of the thing I 'd suggest changing next year is to avoid the hot dogs .
Also I 'd recommend delicious homemade ice cream .
It was fantastic experience , especially for people for which it was intended .
It 's breaking my heart to hear that you 're in so terrible situation .
You 're such a cute , little girl .
Let me know what is your decision .
I discovered the English language when I was eight , and that amazed me so much that one year later I started to take a course .
English was also the key for my passion for technology , the more that I understood the language , the more I understood how to use computers and the internet .
About six months later , I joined a computer class for kids in the same location that I took the English classes and since then , my love for computers and the language just grew .
That is why I wish to work in the areas of Computer Sciences , and studying abroad would give me an extra motivation and open new doors to show and expand my full potential .
Besides being my personal favorite for its culture and language , the United States of America offers big opportunities in this area , for it 's great universities and educational system .
I am currently an intern on a scientific research program in a group called GALP - Logical Programming Teaching Group , that , with the local city hall of Araraquara , aims to transform the city into a national technology , research and software producing center , accomplishing this goal by teaching logical thinking and alghoritms to kids , diminishing future evasion in many exact sciences courses .
Although I write and speak English in an advanced proficiency level , this exchange would provide the fluency I need in academic grounds and interpersonal communication , as all of the most relevant papers , research and journals are written in English , I want to achieve this level to make it easier to write and produce good material for the scientific community , and to communicate better with all cultures .
In Brazil , there is a huge lack of professionals on the field of information technology in both academic and work market , travelling abroad , especially in the U.S. , would qualify me in both areas .
I would be happy too , if by any chance I could apply to summer jobs or internships , as another way of gaining experience .
Working as an intern at an information technology company or as a teacher assistant would provide me with a good example of how the market work for both academic and work careers .
In conclusion , I want to study in the U.S. for it 's differentiated educational system , for the work and research opportunities that I might find , to know better a culture that amazes me for its capacity to innovate in all fields , to become fluent in a language that I love , to return to my country with more knowledge in areas that I would not find here , and , in long - term , become a better professional or teacher , with a good and solid background on computer sciences , information technology and finally , system analysis and development .
There are many places to visit but the most beautiful is Traku castle .
It is very popular pace to visit among tourists .
The castle is very big and you will need some hours to visit it .
If you want to visit it , order a guide who will tell you the history of the castle in English .
Moreover , there are many souvenirs sellers so you could buy something .
" Installation art " is a new form of expression made of a mixture of media art works , used by contemporary artists to communicate something in a modern way , different from traditional arts .
It was situated into a stand in Parque Del Retiro , in Madrid .
It was built by two different elements .
The first , placed in a corner of the stand , was made by a pile of plastic bottles and plastic baskets .
Seeing it for the first time it was impossible to understand the meaning of the column or the pile .
Only after having read the explanation it was possible to appreciate the installation art , and to have the complete attention to its meaning and shape .
Despite their beauty , new form of arts are very complicated to understand , especially compared to classical arts .
An example could be the medieval art .
Seeing a Da Vinci 's portrait or a landscape painting , it is immediately possible to appreciate the beauty of colours or the accuracy of shapes and the expressions of the subjects painted .
At first sight those paintings evoke an emotion in the observer , and the name of the piece helps to have a complete knowledge of the masterpiece .
On the other hand , looking at an installation art it is harder to have a clear emotion at the first sight without knowing the meaning of it or something about the artist .
In conclusion I think that all forms of art are made for the same reason , to communicate something .
In every historic period , artists have represented their life and what they feel in different ways .
Classical art was more easy for us to understand because it has been studied at school and it is very famous , while modern arts are totally new and more complicated to understand because of their composition and their significance .
In my opinion the difference between installation arts and classical arts stands in the feeling that they can suscitate in the audience .
Dear Camp Director :
I have experience in looking after children .
I am always willing to help in anything . I can be very creative when in comes to fun things .
In the other hand , they should learn something new in the summer camp .
Kitesurfing - this sport discipline is getting more and more popular not only in countries such as Australia , Turkey or Egypt , but also in other ones , just like Poland or Germany !
A feeling of being completely free , a joy of moving on a surface of water standing on a small board , an incredible speed - all of those things can easily make you happy .
If you just learn how to keep a control of your body standing on a surfboard and how to steer a kite , there 's nothing that seems hard any more .
Last month I helped at Adele 's concert at the Royal Albert Hall .
Although I was a cleaner , it was the best thing , that recently happened to me .
Before the concert I had to sweep up the whole hall .
During the concert I was responsible for supervision of sort - out in toiletes .
It was n't my dreamy job , but it really repayed .
After the concert I saw Adele and my friend took a picture of me with her !
She smiled to me !
By the way , I met there your exgirlfriend with her new boyfriend .
Of course , I told her , you 're dating Lisa now .
I hope , it wo n't be my last job at concert .
This past year was special for me , I graduated from High School and I took a gap - year .
It was a very confusing but probably the best year of my life and I will tell you why .
As I said earlier , I graduated from High School which was a huge relief .
It was aweful .
Thus came the question of what I was going to do next , but I was n't ready to make that descission back then so with agreement of my parents I decided to take a gap - year .
I was going to spend the next 6 months in the United States which actually teriffied me .
As my departure came closer , I started to question myself more and more if this was a good idea and if I would have a good time all those things .
The journey to the United States was surprisingly good , I had some friends on the plan who were going to the same destination as me and I actually did n't miss my family that much .
The 6 months I send there were the best of my life , I was so happy and enjoyed myself every day .
I also got to know myself better and I have reached a descission of what I want to do next year , I am going to study at the university .
I hope that I will enjoy that as much as I enjoyed this past year , it was truly amazing .
So if you are ever even considering the fact of taking a gap - year , do n't doubt , just do it .
I was wondering that maybe it 's just my imagination .
Eventually , I slowly opened the door and came out of my room .
I went to the kitchen and sit on the chair , nervously fiddling with my bracelet .
It suddenly broke apart , and all the beads dropped on the floor .
In that sinister silence , it seemed to be the loudest sound on the world .
All of sudden , my phone rang .
Before I made it to tell something , I heard terrible scream and my friend just hung up .
I felt cold sweat again , just like five minutes ago when I 'd seen open window .
We havent't talked for ages " .
We at Madhura Nagar , understand the need of protecting the environment and hence are committed to what we do .
We limit the number of houses and the number of people living in those houses because more people would mean we have to clear vast expanses of land for housing which would mean a reduction in the number of trees and a deathblow to the natural balance .
We encourage people commuting to nearby places to walk or use a bicycle depending on the distance and those going to the same areas outside the town to join car pools .
We also have a biogas plant in our outskirts that takes care of the rubbish and sewage and the power generated is used for street - lights and meeting the power needs of the community office .
We distribute jute bags annually with our community logo on it so that people can use them instead of plastic bags .
Each year , we encourage school - going children to plant trees to teach them the importance of trees in safeguarding our environment so that they can grow up to be responsible towards the environment .
We encourage people who come up with any innovative thoughts about how we could further protect the environment .
Dear MR . Smith
I would like to apply for the job as a security guard for the Openair Frauenfeld as advertised in your Facebook - post from the 18th of July .
I 've been working as a security guard in a lot of places around the world .
I was in a position of a leader for a Katie Perry concert and I worked for Angela Merkel when François Hollande arrived in Berlin .
I was a paramedic in first place but then I wanted to change something in my life and combined my hobby , which is going to the gym , and became a security .
With these experiences I can safely escort people , which are knocked out or a bit ill and ca n't stand the concert anymore , out of a concert and help them .
The only exception is volleyball - I just ca n't play it , I even do n't know why .
But I love basketball and handball - especially the first one - every time when we are playing basketball at school during Physical Education , I 'm so happy about it and I do my best . I do n't know how to explain why I love this game so much .
Maybe it 's because in basketball , you have to run a lot and you have to be really fast , and my second favourite sport is running .
Anyway - if someone asked me for advice about basketball , I would say : do n't give up if you are n't the best player on the world . I 'm also not .
Public loves to know everything about their idols and they always try to find out some spicy details .
Everyone deserves privacy , but public figures should be aware of the fact that the society wants to know about them as much as it 's possible .
Whether they like it or not , they should be prepared for photographers and journalists trying to chase them in every single moment of their life .
It might be hard , but they need to be patient and try not to care about the people who interferes with their personal being .
In my opinion , journalists and paparazzi should n't stalk celebrities on their private holiday or try to get into their intimate life .
There are some borders that should n't be crossed .
Even though they are well known , they have a right to have a free time and they should be albe to use it however they want to without anyone disturbing them .
It 's really important for people to know the bound between curiosity and nosiness .
We should respect other 's right to privacy and let them live their own lives .
Nature is one of the most important theme in the Romantic Age , since it is a reality that inspired many writers , both novelist and poets .
It has been an important subject especially for writers from the ' ' first generation '' like William Wordsworth ; he saw nature as an inseparable reality from man , whereas it comforts in sorrow and teaches to love and to act in a moral way .
In the Romantic Age we can find another important subject based on the concept of nature : the sublime .
It is associated with strong emotions caused natural spectacles , like hurricanes , waterfalls or starry sky
The sublime inspired many writers likeW. Wordworth and S. Coleridge , who had a conception of it as the feeling brought by the view of infinite spaces , like desert , sky or ocean .
The idea of the sublime that Wordswoth had is considered by many as the standard idea of the Romantic sublime : forms of nature that inspire feeling of awe , danger or weakness .
Also Coleridge had a concept of sublime , but for him it was associated with infinite spaces and the sense of perdition and suspense .
I am a 20 year old girl with an immense desire to get busy this summer .
I am very familiar with the tasks and rules that need to be respected in a summer camp , as I have been one in a previous summer camp within St John Ambulance .
It was in my duty to make sure everything was running smoothly , according to the program and I had to supervise and direct the other assistants if any problems should occur .
I am a qualified first aider and I am able to undertake any minor or major health problems that might arise .
I have been volunteering for St John Ambulance for 6 years now and I can say that it is a truly amazing and eye opening experience .
Here are some tips to help you get a positive first impression .
Instead of that you should show that you have experience or specific education in the area .
Going on a job interview can be a stressful experience for even the most job seekers but if you use these tips , the first impression of you will be positive .
I would like to share my feelings about a particular friendship that is highly important to me and furthermore evaluate the reasons why is especially complicated to maintain long lasting friendships in any situation .
First of all , as far as special friendships are concerned , I must say that I am not a person who makes friends easily , consequently I do not have a large circle of friends .
Although it is true that this is not a long term friendship I can admit that I have found a true friend .
Throughout this friendship I have been given the support , the affection and the confidence to pursue my dreams .
On the other hand , friendship is a two way street where you receive and give back the same favors and , naturally , I enjoy doing so .
I value this friendship and is of great importance to me because it is a balanced one of a kind relationship .
A justification for this may be the fact that over the years people change and grow apart .
For this reason not all childhood friends grow older as close confidants , simply because they are not the same people as they were before .
As you gradually grow up your world expands , your personality changes and so do your acquaintances .
However , the natural process of aging is not the only change we undergo but there are others such as enrolling in school , getting our first job or changing the old one , travelling or moving to another city .
All this situations may impede us to stay in touch with old friends but on the other hand can give us the opportunity to make new ones .
To summarize , I would like to say that even thought we are incapable to remain on friendly terms with everyone we should know that the process of socializing is one of the factors what makes us human and we should always embrace it .
There is also a food court on the third floor , catering to all sorts of customers , as well as a few restaruants on the first and second floors .
On the top floor there is a multi - cinema complex , offering several options of the latest movies .
There are two underground floors for parking , which can get a bit crowded at peak seasons , but which are very reasonably priced .
Another shopping option is the main streeet in the centre of Viña del Mar , which used to be more popular in the past , but which was displaced by the shopping centres .
All in all , I consider there is a wide variety of shopping options in our home town , so I expect tourists would not be disappointed with what there is to offer .
This report has the aim to show and discuss the main ways to reduce the pollution and to take care of the environment in Zaragoza .
Some information about what people do with their rubbish and how they try to keep the area clean , is described in the following lines .
Although the majority of the citizens in Zaragoza do n't give a special treatment to their rubbish , there are some people who have recycle bins in their homes .
Also , Zaragoza is provided with a number of collection points , where rubbish with big dimensions such as furniture can be collected and recycled .
How do the town try to keep the area clean :
There is a law which states that if someone throws rubbish such as papers , cigarettes or chewing gum to the street , they may be punished with a fine which could increase up to $ 100 .
A commercial team responsible for raise awareness of the critical situation the environment is suffering .
3 . More than 200 buses with the aim to avoid excessive CO2 emissions .
Zaragoza 's population is aware of the importance of keeping the town clean and so they 're willing to do plenty of things to avoid the pollution and its environmental consequences .
Hi , my name is Emma I 'm 16 years old and I believe that I would be perfect for this summer job .
I 'm have 2 little brothers and I think I 'm capable of taking care of little and older kids .
I 've always liked to play with kifds and make fun activities with them .
My favorite activities would be : painting , and making up fun games .
Although I like playing with kids of all ages , I think that I will have more things to do with the kid between ages 8 - 10 , because I find myself more open with kids between those ages .
I can cook anything , really , just give me the ingredients and I 'll make you whatever you want .
As I said before , I 'm really good with little kids , I 've been a teacher once at a summer school .
It was 8:00 o'clock in the morning that Saturday in L.A. , and suddenly an urgent message appeared in the TV news and in all the radio channels .
They announced that the Big One earthquake would occur that afternoon at 7:00 PM approximately , so they alerted that people had to leave the city or go to save places in the few hours .
Peter decided to help his father with his work and the problems that were happening , while his mother was doing the luggage and preparing the car to leave .
Peter and his father were very busy solving problems of neighbours and it took them some hours .
However Narwal Ji has taught me from the basics of Indian singing , to being someone able to sing on stage in front of a large audience .
He had given me a great opportunity to grow as a beginner singer to sing during a concert and his guidance as a teacher is something that I will always appreciate .
The night had been a rewarding experience and boosted my confidence a greatly .
Overall the entire night was shown nicely and was entertaining for everyone watching .
You requested us to organise a visit to a place or building that mirrors one aspect of our life here .
We have brainstormed about many possibly interesting locations , and we eventually decided to prepare a little tour at and around the Grand Place of Brussels .
Away from busy and noisy roads , the beautiful old inner city reflects what Brussels really was for centuries ; small but cosy cobblestone streets flanked by small houess and shops in light colours and old - fashioned roofs .
We would gladly share our excitement about the Grand Place with your students so that they can immediately get acquainted with it as a very enjoyable place to go to .
Sincerely ,
Most of the year I live in Poznań , because of my studies at the University , but every summer I go back home to spend some time with my family and friends .
It opens only in a time of summer , mainly for tourists .
Because of that , there are no regular employees , at the beginning of every summer new season stuff is hired .
It was like working in a paradise .
The main reason why I loved to work there and every day I went to work with a big smile on my face were the possibilities to watch every show I wanted .
There is only one auditorium so I was busy just between the shows and sometimes , for family shows , there was a 15 minutes break in the middle of the show , for the kids to use the toilet or buy more snacks and drinks .
I watched almost every shown movie , some of them for more than once .
I mean , it was September , so I had a one whole month of vacation ahead of me to do whatever I wanted to and it was awesome because I could finally just relax , sleep , read books and spend a lot of time with my loved ones .
This place really stole my heart and I miss its atmosphere , regular visitors and people I worked with .

In 1975 the consumption of fish and chips was ten times higher than the consumption of the other two types of fast food .
However , the quantity of fish and chips plates eaten per year declined from 100 times per year in 1975 to just over 80 times in 1980 .
In contrast , the consumption of hamburgers and pizzas started at about 10 times for hamburgers and 5 times for pizzas in 1975 , and then rose constantly until it reached approximately 100 times and 85 times respectively in 1995 .

The place is very near where I live , and I 've worked in a lot of Cafes before , unfortunately I had to leave them for school and college .
Sometimes I do n't have time for myself to have fun , and for what I can see from your place , it is very popular and full of fun people .
I 'm very eclectic , but also fierce where I should be .
I may not know how to cook the usual food from the cafe , but I am a fast learner . I will only need one day to get used to the food and learn how to practise at home , and then it 's up to me find a way to be good at it .
I wo n't be much problem for anyone .
Set in in the late 1950s France , Chocolat deals with the topic of society discriminating against different people because of their being different : whether they are gypsies , women that do n't depend on men , or people that do n't share the Christian faith .
The plot revolves around Vianne Rocher , a single mother and chocolate expert , opening a ' chocolaterie ' right before Lent in a small , close - minded French village , the mayor of which decides to boycott her .
During Lent , the protagonist gets to know other outcasts ( mainly women ) and help them .
One of the strengths of the film is its star - studded cast : Juliette Binoche as Vianne , Alfred Molina as the mayor , Judi Dench as a grumpy , elder woman resented with the oppressing society of the village , and a young Johnny Depp as a handsome gypsy arriving in town with his caravan .
It adapts perfectly to the theme of the movie , with a little bit of jazz manouche , a popular genre amongst European gypsy communities , and reminiscences of Mexican folklore , as the recipes Vianne Rocher prepares in the ' chocolaterie ' are a heritage from her Maya ancestors .
If I had to find a down side to Chocolat , it would be that the film format does not allow us to have a deeper look into some of the characters and their storylines .
A must - see if , like me , you enjoy cinema with strong female characters on the lead roles , but you do not necessarily want to watch another dramatic story .
Michael Clifford was a lucky man who had everything he could ever want : he was a thirty - year - old English businessman married to a sophisticated mathematician with whom he had two sons and a pretty talented daughter ; he owned a successful corporation and had a gorgeous chalet near the sea .
He hardly ever drunk alcohol , but thought it would be impolite not to , as he had been invited by his colleague .
Later that night , while Michael was cheerful chatting with the barman , his mobile phone emitted a sound .
He rushed out of the pub , open the car and went inside , not knowing that he was to die in an accident because of his current state .
However , it is a wise decision to choose carefully between public and personal transport , because they have both advantages and disadvantages depending on where we want to travel .
On the one hand , personal cars are great because they allow people to travel whenever they want .
Sometimes it is cheaper to use public transport such as busses , trains or airplanes , depending on the distance .
Travelling across the Atlatic Ocean for example requires an airplane or a ship .
Trains are a great way of transport across intercontinental distances , especially since they have become faster .
All in all , I believe that public transport will not disappear too soon .
Time was ticking by and he knew that if he did n't do it now he would be in deep trouble , that his social life would be over .
All of them anxious to get outside and relax for a few hours Suffering from an endless punishment : knowledge .
As he got near his destination the density of students seemed to grow and it was becoming even more difficult for him to advance in that sea of moving bodies .
Fortunatley ,
Poland is classed as a country with a hard history and a lot of places remind about it .
Besides their past we can , fortunately adore their beauty .
In this small part of Cracow , you can meet with Jewish culture and the architectural style .
For those who enter it will be an ' unforgettable ' experience .
You walk among ancient , fallen tombs shaded by high trees of great age .
It is the oldest synagogue in Poland and was constructed in the XV century .
Finally , you can do shopping on The New Square , a round trading hall .
You can buy there almost everything : fresh fruits , vegetables , and household products .
On Sundays , the gamut of products is much more bigger .
Parents face with important decisions when raising children , not the least of which is whether or not they should allow their children to keep a pet .
Some parents would grasp in horror and reject it when their child asks them if he can keep a pet with him , whereas other parents would be more than happy to let their children have a pet .
In my view , I believe that children should have pets because they can benefit from taking care of pets , especially in terms of their personality development .
Take my cat , Luka , for example , I found it on the streets and felt like keeping it with me when I was 12 years old .
My mother told me that you would have to take care of it by yourself when I went to ask her if I could keep the cat .
Since that day , I started to take care of on my own .
I took it to the hospital when it was sick , and bought it food when it needed to be fed .
This does not suggest that children can not learn from having a pet with them .
For instance , when Luka died when I was 20 years old , I was so sad and heart - broken as if one member was lost in our family .
After that day , I started to be able to sympathize with people who have lost their beloved ones because I have been through a similar situation .
Given upon my personal experiences , by taking care pets , children not only can learn to take responsibility , but also can learn to sympathize with others .
In other words , keeping pets is beneficial to children in terms of their personality development .
Not only financial development but also the environment is essential to a healthy city .
Reducing waste at source is always our top priority and education is of utmost importance in this regard .
Recycling bins have been installed in every public housing estate and most housing estates , along with the road - side ones found in every district .
We have seen a great drop in the number of solid waste .
Tree planting campaign is carried out every year in cooperation with schools , community centres , etc .
Eco - tour is also promoted to educate the public and tourists to appreciate the beauty of nature and , above all , to arouse their awareness and cultivate a caring heart towards nature .
With concerted efforts , we have made a great stride in environmental protection in recent years as seen in the declining number of waste and increasing number of greenery .
The round table ' Russia - Turkey : prospects of relations at the modern stage ' in St Petersburg State University
On April 29 , 2014 St. Petersburg state University hosted the round table " Russia - Turkey : prospects of relations at the modern stage " .
Bekir Günay , the Director of the Eurasian Institute , Associate Professor , told about a new understanding of Eurasianism .
He also broached a subject of the Eurasian Community development , noting that it 's very important if it 's developing to the equality or dominance .
In particular , he applied the theory of Joseph Nye Jr. 's " soft power " to the relations of Russia and Turkey .
Other participants of the Turkish - Russian round table also talked on current issues of the history and current relations between the two Eurasian countries .
He also referred to the recent action of the Turkish authorities on sudden introduction of new requirements to the expiration of foreign passports .
Just before the beginning of mass tourism season in Turkey , it was announced that the passport should be valid at least four months from the date of entry .
The round table in St. Petersburg State University has attracted quite a large audience .
During the break the participants enjoyed traditional Turkish sweets .
Living in a big city I can cycle to work every day , which I believe is a great way to exercise and reduce my environmental footprint .
Besides , cycling along a canal allows me to witness flowers and trees blossoming and fowls ' chicks growing up , reminding me of the beauty of nature .
However I believe that it is at home that I contribute most to saving natural resources ; we are , obviously , very careful with turning off the taps as we wash our hands , brush our teeth and so on , and we recycle as much as possible .
We live in the mass consumption century , when it requires more and more time of our daily routines .
For some this activity is a torture , for others it is the most pleasurable way of spending free time .
But have you ever gone to the shop just for milk and bread and came back with a full bag of goods but no bread ?
It depends on a person how often he goes to grocery , probably according to individual needs .
Most of consumers do not count time spent in food stores , as they have their own habits and their attitudes towards shopping .
Some people choose bigger supermarkets as they offer greater variety of goods , but require more time , while others just pop into the closest store and do their shop weekly .
If you have a already made shopping list , it saves your time and energy , so that you do not need to wander between rows in grocery store .
When it comes to parties it is even more time consuming and irksome , than the ordinary one .
The queue you are standing in seems to be always the longest .
Hundreds gather there , parking spaces are full , again facing longest queues in stores - how much unpleasant is souds , it is the reality of nowadays .
People become crazy , nervous or dull while shopping .
Afterwards some get into their cars and get stuck in traffic jams on the way home , it causes more tension and disimproves mood !
Also , some people spend huge sums of money on things that are not essential , they are attracted by commercials , advertisements , sales assistant recommendations , so they do not follow their budgets by buying everything , as they are excited by the shopping process itself , it causes regrets and financial problems afterwards .
Finally , it may be very fatigue , as you may waste the precious time just by walking around but not finding the thing are interested in and need .
Then you feel tired and depressed about the idea of keep looking for it in another place .
On the other hand , the majority feel lazy and they go shopping just for special occasions , without any rush , they dedicate time in search of fashionable clothes , best quality garmets , stylish items .
Although , shopping may be entertaining , it is still a time consuming and tiresome job .
Being busy and spending time looking for clothes , presents , souvenirs , furniture or healthcare products especially for women may be a perfect way of spending even all day .
On the other hand , searching for your favourite brands , non - seasonal products , some special goods , just looking through shelves , trying the garmets on you , asking for consultations , testing products , there is plenty of work to do to make a perfect purchase .
This may be the reason why some go for bread and milk and forget about it , after entering a colourful and attractive store .
All in all , I strongly believe that shopping is not enjoyable by the vast majority .
Fortunately , this unnavoidable part of our lives is not that problematical anymore , as we may experience the pleasures of online shopping without leaving home .
It is a perfect alternative to save time , money and energy for those who are not that willing to hit the mall .
She always wanted to be in the spotlights , in which she had always succeeded , since everyone adored her .
She was expecting a letter of the local drama club , in which they would reveal the character list of their new play .
Jennifer had auditioned , and she was 100% sure that she would become the main woman .
Oh my God , oh my God , that must be the letter of the drama club ! " , Jennifer screamed .
" Dear Jennifer and Carly Brown , We are delighted to inform you that Carly is chosen to become the main woman of our new play .
I could n't believe my ears ! I , Carly Brown , the insipid and far less interesting sister of the great Jennifer Jones , the most beautiful girl in town , was chosen to become the main woman in a big play !
From that moment on , I haven't been in Jennifer 's shadow anymore - she was in my shadow .
The industrial revolution took place in England from the end of 18th century to the middle of the 19th and it completely transformed this place .
English economy changed from an agriculture one to an industrial one : in England there was an increase in pollution and also terrible hygienic conditions , the landscape changed a lot and also houses , shops and people .
These strong changes influenced very much the poetry and we can see that for example in Blake , because in " The Tyger " he uses a lot of colors referred to the industrial life ( red , orange , silver .. ) and he describes the Tyger 's creator as an artisan that create it on a furnace .
Instead the American and French revolutions are important because they introduced the idea of freedom , fraternity and equality , so also these concepts influenced strongly the poetry of the period .
We can see the conceit of freedom in Shelley 's " Ode to the West Wind " , where the wind is wild and it is the very symbol of freedom ; instead , in the " Rime of the Ancient Mariner " , we can see the brotherhood of mariners in the ship and of party guests and also the equality of all the God 's creatures .
The idea of brotherhood is present also in " I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud " by Wordsworth because he sees nature , daffodils in this case , as a friend to men .
During recent thirteen years , the cost of living has been significantly increasing in most countries .
This change makes most people have to work every day even using their private time , so they need to find out the best way to save their time and fill their energy after work .
Fast food is one of ways to solve that problem .
People who have just done their work are very hungry ; they can not go to home and cook their diet meals by themselves but their bodies need to be provided energy in order to sustain their lives and continue their jobs , so junk food is considered the best way to solve the hunger .
To make it clear , the bosses , who are always busy in their business , usually eat fast food , they go to KFC or Lottie Mart to buy them they even might get fast food by phone because of fast delivery .
In addition , Junk food is very easy to be found out .
Therefore , finding a good place to buy and enjoy a meal with fast food is not so difficult and it will not take time for people to go back their work on time .
Junk food contains large unhealthy chemicals such as high percentage of fat and cholesterol which are the most reasons leading customers to obesity and cancers .
According to scientists they said that people who usually eat plenty of junk food will have more than 50% of risks to get obese and even die soon .
Furthermore , most of junk food just solves hunger in a short time and then it will quickly return to the customers after they have felt full .
Finally is the loss of traditional meals .
As the consequence , they gradually forget how to cook a simple meal and the diversity of healthy food is slightly gone .
Some advantages are that fast food can help to save time and deal with the temporary hunger for white - collar - worker , but it can also harm their health .
The customer should be careful before they choose fast food to be a part of their daily diet .
Within 6 years , Facebook has reached more than 1 billion users and still growing rapidly .
As a shy person , I can confirm the differences between real life and virtual interacion .
For example , if you want to find someone who likes the same movie genders or series on social media , all you have to do is type in an interest .
While it can seem harmless , cyberbullying causes many problems among teenagers , such as depression , suicidal thoughts or even worse .
To conclude , although social media seems flawless , we should always be careful and responsible before we sign up .
I saw the advertisement for a job to work this summer camp .
I really thought I would be the right person for this .
I am really hardworking and love kids , I used to babysit for my neighbour 's kids , so looking after kids will be easy for me .
Working in the kitchen does not seem so bad either , because I know that everything depends on our attitude and if I have a positive attitude I 'll have a good time no matter if I 'm doing a fun activity or cleaning dishes .
I hope you think I 'm the right person for this , I think this would be a great experience for me as well as for the kids .
People and Change "
I feel that this can be attributed in the first instance to the changing nature of modern societies .
We are , therefore , in a situation in many countries today where to be highly mobile is something
Even though the boat was ready to go Jessica was afraid for it to break in pieces again , she almost could foresee that forthcoming heavy rain destroying her boat , so she had an idea .
She tied the boat with long and very strong textiles made out of synthetic fibers that she found on the plane ; she also used nails to join some new and more resistant wood into the boat .
She was ready to leave but something inside her was telling her to stay , the boat was very resistant but not enough to travel for days and maybe weeks across the ocean , she was afraid .
Meanwhile Jacob is completely in love with that girl he met weeks before , her name was Scarlett , she said that her dad was in the military and was working on a high - tech portable device that will change gravity in low levels and in a short period of time , like a fraction of a second , but it was later suspended because their boss told them it was very dangerous to experiment on and it was going to be very expensive , but as her dad continued with the experiment his boss got so mad he kicked them from the city into that mysterious island .
She also explained that they did n't know how the majority of people on the island got there , thereby not all of them spoke the same language , but they learned how to communicate with signs .
They had a lot of things in common , they liked the same kind of music , the same kind of food and they both liked to read about fantasies and comics .
Jacob told her again if she wanted to go with him to a better place but she still denied , until she accepted with only one condition , if all her family could go with them .
Jacob told Jessica if they could leave the island with Scarlett 's family , she was not happy about it but she said yes .
But they needed to make the boat even more resistant and rigid so it will support all the family and all the extra food they will need .
Some Pro - choice groups and individuals believe that a person have to right of choice , this includes the right to decide if they want to give birth or not .
Even though in some circumstances , such as life threatening and sexual abuse pregnancies , it could be the best thing to do .
Hence , every woman must be able to have abortion as a choice .
Abortion can be given as an option in life threatening.pregnancies .
The presence of a mother is important in a child 's life especially in the first few months .
During the first months , he relationship between a mother and a child rapidly develops .
The baby 's inborn capacity of imitation and regulation of visual and auditive stimulation , is gradually patterned and this is supported by the mother 's empathetic response .
This natural process would be interrupted by the absence of the mother and the child 's development could be in this case negatively influenced .
Development of emotional and psychological problem such as maternal deprivation can be a result .
The child will have difficulties building and sustaining relationships during adult - life .
Because of this risk abortion can be considered an option .
Besides , abortion could also be considered in case of impregnation as a result of sexual abuse .
Impregnation as a result of sexual abuse is not uncommon and in these cases abortion should be a choice .
Sexual violence has a devastating impact on victims , all areas of a victim 's life is affected .
Many victims believe that the additional trauma related to carrying their rapist child can be avoided by terminating the pregnancy , and therefore help them put the assault behind them and recover more quickly .
Even though , not all victims will choose to have an abortion it has to be given as an option .
Even if , abortion has to be given as a choice in special cases , it is not a solutions for accidental pregnancies .
It is for the person who decides to have coitus to make sure to use appropriate anti conception .
Otherwise , you may run the risk that people seeing abortion as an easy way to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy .
In order to prevent this , it is important to apply strict guidelines regarding situation where abortion is given as an option .
Abortion only has to be approved as an option in life threatening.pregnancies or if the mother has been sexually molested .
Undeterred by this , it still the mother 's decision if she wants to save her own life or carry and care for her rapist child .
I had the opportunity to be a student and work as a research assistant with Dr. Montés in the same field .
He taught to people from different backgrounds , to undergraduate and postgraduate students , and managed to explain difficult public health topics marvellously .
Also in Master 's degree final project II , Dr Montés helped us to accomplish the master 's degree thesis with excellence .
In my work as a research assistant for Dr. Montés , I experienced great learning in many fields , not only in Public Health topics but also in research methodology , public speaking , and writing .
I witnessed and learn form his ability to work with other faculties such as Faculty of Medicine , Department of Engineering , Faculty of Economics , and School Law .
I assisted to policy making forums and events where Dr Montés was a speaker and his opinion was highly respected .
Moreover , we developed projects with multidisciplinary teams for the following institutions : the Colombian Ministry of Health , and the World Bank with excellent results .
I reckon Dr Montés fulfils the requirements of the position you offer .
Since he has great expertise teaching , and an excellent boss , respectful of the opinion , time , and personal background of everybody .
I think that he will be great asset for your college .
I 'm writing in response of the letter the professor Collins wrote to you .
In the letter he complaints about the out - of - date system of schools in Italy and he made some suggestions about how this could be overcome by major educational reforms .
First of all , the professor says that the majority of Italian teachers are not well prepared to do their work and , consequently , students do n't achieve the skills they should to success in a future work , but I do n't agree with this statement .
I think that the real problem that makes our schools so out - of - date comparing to that of other countries is the way teachers get in touch with students and transmit them their knowledge .
As a matter of fact students are often seen as empty pitchers ready to be filled by as many information as they can contain .
They should make their students live school as a pleasant experience , as something their future is based on .
Secondly , in his letter the professor suggests that schools should spend more money on computer equipment .
I agree with this recommendation because I think it 's important for schools to make the same progresses the society does year by year , offering always new materials and technologies , such as computers or interactive whiteboards in classrooms , making studying more interesting and sometimes also easier .
This is what , in my opinion , must be changed in schools to satisfy the society necessities and overcome the old and inappropriate " out - of - date " system .
Many people feel that it is good to do their student life easier .
On the one hand , I firmly believe that students can find more valuable information on textbooks because they have existed for many centuries .
For this reason , I believe that they have content more reliable .
Furthermore , if you go to a library , you could spend all day seeing books and learning about different things so in these places there are many ancient books .
On the other hand , I personally think that pupils enjoying more working with textbooks because they can do this activity with classmates and they can help each other .
Also , in my opinion , young people should not use computers for much time because this could be dangerous for their health , appearing sight problems or headaches .
Taking everything into account , in my opinion every student should have a good encyclopaedia at home because it is much better for their education .
There is a lot of people I admire , starting with my own parents as they have to work so hard to end lines and to pay the rent as well as their employees and to give us- my brother and me- a good living today and future tomorrow .
As a writer - to - be I admire her work creating a fantastic world of magic and epic as well as dark characters which are recognizable all around the globe .
His ' Song of fire and ice ' saga has been brought into the television world in the name of Game of thrones and it is currently being awarded as the best drama tv series of all times .
My fascination about those people is that they fought for their people 's rights , black race 's rights , in a world of white people treating them as slaves and bullying them .
Because knowledge is the best weapon we got against those who want to rule us as they want .
I am at home in my lovely house , where I love every detail of the interier , where every thing is on its place .
It is weekend and we all together today .
We play piano , sing favorite songs , play table games , we laugh a lot and love these weekends together very much .
Sometimes our kids invite friends and today my son came with his girlfriend .
After all this courses that I 've done I am wise and do n't talk a lot .
Next to me everybody feel calm and confident . I 've learned a lot in the last 15 years .
Every word I say I say for a reason .
My kids are proud to have parants like me and my husband .
Together we make this world a better planet .
We found a way to help a lot of people to live happy life and enjoy what they have .
We 've planed a nice event to celebrate my 50 .
Friends , colleagues , family all thes people who was next to me on this way to this wonderful day .
I have just started teaching a new , face to face group of adults .
I was excited to get back into the classroom , I mainly teach online today , and try out some of my new skills on a group .
The group 's native language is Amharit ; they have all had to learn Hebrew , so English is a third or for some of them a fourth language .
So I switched off the projector , took out my white board pen , dusted off my flash cards and reverted back to traditional methods of teaching .
To begin with , recent statistics reveal that obese adolescents ' ratio is rising .
And last but not least , it seems that new technologies are not helping to develop their social and intellectual skills .
In addition , spending too much time in activities like watching TV , surfing the Internet or playing video games prevent them from doing sports .
And finally , teenagers may become more dependent and introverted because of electronic devices such as mobile phones or personal computers .
For instance , filling the fridges with a great amount of fresh fruit and vegetables , doing some exercise and have some fun with friends regularly .
How are you ? I 'm taking a year off and staying in London for six months so I hope you can help me if it is n't too much to ask .
I 'd like to find a part - time job but first of all I have to find an apartment to live , so I was wondering if you can look for a small apartment where I can live in ; it would be better if it 's near the underground station and in the city centre so that I can go sightseeing in my free time .
I 'm looking for a well - paid job because I know that houses are expensive in the city centre .
I 'm looking forward to being there , I also need to take a rest and that 's the reason why I want to find a part - time and not a full - time job .
I hope I 'm not asking too much and I 'd be really pleased if you 'll give me your help .
Thanks you very much .
The more computer science influences human 's lives , the more important status robotics has in the field of engineering .
Only a decade year ago , robotics was just limited to scientific research .
However , today it is used in more fields , such as medical treatment , elderly - nursing and archaeological studies , as well as education .
2012 ) described an experiment from Showa University which aimed to test how well dental students could deal with emergency situation .
The result indicated that although the patients were merely robots , out of 98 candidates , only 22% students correctly gave the diagnoses .
From a survey , 78% and 72% of students considered robot patients to be useful in medical emergency and risk training , whilst 63% of them thought it had a great value in training for surgical treatment .
It is obvious that in this experiment , students could acquire knowledge more effectively and teachers could also realize weakness of students specifically .
University of Southern Denmark organized an experiment , which aimed to examine how well robotics techniques named I - BLOCKS ( a modular electronic building block system ) could do on language tests .
Surprisingly , the result illustrated that these robots can not only put words in right order grammatically , but also recognise whether a sentence is correct or not .
Furthermore , the I - BLOCKS application could also build structures of robots which are smart to react to surroundings , and build binary expression to calculate in real - time and show both final results and sub - results ( Lund , Marti , & Palma , as cited in Nielsen & Lund , 2008 ) .
With the help of robotics , like I - BLOCKS , students and teachers might spend less time on studying and some sophisticated processes are simplified as well .
Nevertheless , robotics is not that satisfying because it is complicated to operate which is always the reason why operators are distracted .
Suh et al . ( 2010 ) described an experiment that aimed to test differences of time on operating robots to do tasks .
Two groups of participants were asked to do suture - tying task and a secondary task with distraction , such as decision - making , memory - task .
It was found that there was an apparent difference on average speed and completion time when comparing tasks from students with basic knowledge and the one from another group .
Moreover , in the task with distraction , experienced group was 1/3 - 1/2 faster in analyzing .
Even though it becomes more efficient to study with robotics ' help , uneasy operating requires much time .
Perhaps being familiar with robotics and good at operating could help out of this shortage .
Today , more people not only in the field of education , but also in different fields , have made use of robotics as tools to deepen their exploring and studying .
It is possible that the robotics would be a normal part of individual 's lives .
Mordoch et al.(2012 ) made some examples of robotics in daily lives : social human - robot , social assistive robot , therapeutic robot , mental commitment robot , care robot , robot - therapy .
To a country , robotics could be new weapons for the future technological wars .
However , there is some debate that it is against ethics to let warrior robots participate in modern wars and fight with real soldiers ( Troop , 2012 ) .
However , disadvantages of robotics and some social or ethical problems should be considered carefully while robotics is contributing to human 's lives .
In conclusion , with technology and computer science developing , application of robotics widens from scientific research to a variety of fields now .
Besides influences on education , robotics has an effect on medical treatment , nursing and even design to future war as well .
Even though robotics brings more beneficial consequences and advantages than its disadvantages , its shortcomings still should not be neglected and more scientific research should be done to improve application of robotics .
Public transport allows you to save time and money in commuting .
Public transport is so necessary in big cities that car industry is continuously developing new means of transport .
Not only can customers choose a wide range of transport to commute , but they can also discover technologies that are not available for private purposes .
In small cities it is easiest to travel by car .
Some places have scenic beauty in abundance while many are famous for their architectural wonders .
In addition every person has different tastes , choices and preferences .
Some people enjoy the sight of scenic beauty ; some are attracted towards places of historical and archaeological interests .
I have visited many historical and tourist places in many countries like Belgium , Great Britain , Spain and others .
But the visit which has a lasting impression on my mind is the visit of Red Square .
Nowhere expresses Moscow , Russia 's vast and ancient capital like Red Square .
An enormous 400 by 150 metres , Red Square lies in the centre of Moscow and on its four sides stand the Kremlin , GUM ( Department Store ) , State Historical Museum and Cathedral of the Protection of Most Holy Theotokos ( aka St. Basil 's Cathedral ) centres of government , commerce , history and religion .
It includes domes , cupolas , arches , towers , and spires is sure to inspire you every bit as much in real life as in the photos .
All these and many more like its cultural places , famous streets connected to square and gorges as well as old buildings make it " spirit of Moscow " .
Indeed , the beauty of Moscow is enchanting and have unique spirit .
Anyway , Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism , which mixes comedy and pathos , while the Brontë sisters ' realism is plenty of Romantic and Gothic elements and it 's widely influenced by the desolate English Moors , where they grew up .
In addition , Dickens , as long as Charlotte and Emily Brontë in some of their novels , uses quite frequently the first - person narration .
For example , in " David Copperfield " , Dickens 's most autobiographical novel , the story is talked with a first - person narration with the point of view of the protagonist as an adult .
Much shorter than their fellow colleagues , they have always been able to compensate for their physical lacks with an extremely good tecnique accompanied by a strong head .
You are alone on the tennis court to face your contender .
Though you might be fighting for long and getting tired and tired , you have to search for the strength inside yourself to continue and reach the end of the tennis match .
You have never to surrender : until the last ball has bounced twice on the ground , you have to keep fighting , regardeless of the score .
Fate may play a role but you have still to try and bring out the best of yourself .
Nonetheess , it helps to shape your own personality .
I would definitely recommend whoever would like to start this sport to approach it with a good spirit .
Although it might look difficult at the beginning , time after time you will come to realise how tennis will positively impact on your personal well - being .
I 'm glad I finally heard from you after all this time .
Anyway great to hear that you got the job you really wanted and that you enjoy it quite a lot .
I 'm available whenever you are so it 's an affable idea to meet up and hang out .
We could go shopping in the city centre , they have some very cool stores that we both will be able to enjoy even a Primark and I haven't seen some shops anywhere else yet .
Furthermore there is a huge and cool movie theatre where we could watch a film together , since they 've got some very exciting films coming out .
Or else there are some pubs we could visit , most of the time I quite enjoy going to a pub on the weekends myself , but it 's all up to you .
I 've had lots of things on my head recently , especially after my mom died .
It was very considerate of you to send condolences so please , have my thanks .
I 'm still looking for the one suitable for me .
Last summer I thought I found it .
Also the staff there was very nice and they wanted me to stay , but I needed more money so unfortunately I could n't .
Tell me more about the people you work with and how do you feel there ?
It was a cold night of November I was exploring a lost temple with my friend Michael , we have been looking for that temple since our teen years the temple of the silent cartographer .
The legend says that all the maps of the world are hidden into the temple protected by a guardian called Soneka the dreamer , he is an ancient warrior and his objective is to kill everyone who tries to steal the maps of the cartographer .
at the entrance of the temple were two statues the first was white and the second red , the statues were carrying a sword made of gold and diamonds those swords were used to fight Soneka and to open the gate of the cartographer , once we passed the sculptures our objective was to kill the beast and grab the map of the golden city .
Then we heard a big noise coming from inside the temple it was Soneka his appearance was glorious a big warrior using a golden armor and a big sword his skills were unmatched , he was faster than the sound our only chance was to run to the vault of the cartographer but only one can pass through the door of the cartographer Michael decide to stay out the vault I run into the cartographer and Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Since the concept and preliminary implementation model of the Yiddish Centre was developed in my office , it was expected that World ORT would participate in the project in a few capacities , rather than just including Yiddish component in our events , subject to the theme .
Some of the aspects have been discussed during my meeting with Mordechai in August .
I think that , as Robert once recommended , we should discuss the whole spectrum of our cooperation , not just the seminars , define the feasible components and have a WJC - WO MOU on such subject signed .
Nowadays , travelling by car is much more common than we could ever imagine .
And because history has a way of repeating itself I truly believe that the olden days of using public transport are making a come back .
On the one hand owning a car means independence , so that , we can travel anywhere we want , whenever we want without being tied down to a set timetable and furthermore , it is certainly more comfortable than public transport .
On the other hand , today we are forced to share a transport with other people due to economic problems that our country is facing .
People do not earn as much money as they used to , in fact they earn a lot less .
Therefore , even though a car is more convenient and more comfortable than any form of public transport , it is also less economical than the latter which leaves people with no other choice than to use public transport .
How are you doing ? I 've heard in the grapevine that you 're making a killing with your last pc program .
On the contrary , I 'm just getting used to look up every day on my computer .
One good news is that finally I gave up and bought my first Smartphone .
It has turn out to be very handy .
I also like to have a look at the foreign newspapers but they only let you to read the headlines and the beginning of the article .
I always thought that the Internet was amazing , but now I even surf the web to find some solutions for my children 's homework .
It 's like a blog but it 's written by many people who write there their impressions about beautiful sights .
Well , that 's all for now I hope to hear about you soon .
The structure is divided in these sections :
- Method : Data selection- The three songs we will be analyzed and the reasons why we 've chose them
Furthermore , we will give some examples of clauses that represent better the meaning of our songs .
- Conclusions : The questions we made before will be answered .
With our analysis done , this final part is where the results of our work is written and we can tell the difference between these songs and what we thought at the beginning
These songs are relatively modern , but if we take a look we will find some sexism in some parts .
However , there 's a hope for women to find a song that does n't treat them like an inferior gender .
Still , women are the victim in three different ways . We will search for these situations that share the feelings of regret , made by some specific situations .
Anastasia 's song tells a story of a victim , meanwhile the others talk about women that fell guilty because they have hurted men .
We have found this kind of agent in the songs with the love relationship as the subject .
In our research , the cognition verbs have been the most common inside of the group of the mental ones followed by the affection ones , which is quite normal when describing a love relationship
The woman uses mental and material processes the same amount of times .
Regarding mental processes , cognition is the type more used .
The material processes show some actions that the girl would like to erase because them only make emotional abuse to the man .
As we can see , the boy gave her love and she just want to leave him .
If we look to the boy processes , we will find only positive things .
The processes that appears more usually are mental and relational ( attributive type ) .
These cases are always regarding good actions or showing the good characteristics of the man
.
On the other hand , the woman just say " I 'm sorry " .
The mental processes , specifically the cognition ones , tells us that she had thought a lot about what she did and that she is wrong .
The other participants appears a few times , but these participants tell us important things about the relationship .
Consequently , these participants give us some keys to understand better the situation , but actually they just confirm what the girl feels .
She is regreting because their relationship get worse and it was n't what she supposed it could be .
She broke up , but now she is on his hands .
This can only be explained because he is a good boy and she was ( probably ) confused .
Although now she is sure , she had suffered a lot . " The cold " and " the fear " was inside her .
Even though , there 's a sentence that can confuse anyone .
She has to do it , and is a sacrifice .
This means he still loves her , but at the same time he 's still hurt .
Finally , the woman tells him that she would understand that he does n't want to restart the relationship , but she makes a promise :
The problem is that maybe is too late and she only can wish " I 'd realized what I had when you were mine " .
This sentence and some others sound like if they were pronounced by a man …
After the first few words , you will like the experience and will be hard for you to stop .
It is always interesting to communicate with natives of a foreign language comfortably .
You may find the first initial stages of real stress .
To speed up the learning process , you need to read many comic books in the language that want to learn . I will be hard to understand everything that you read but the pictures in the comic books will help you .
You also need to choose books of your favorite authors .
This is important because you understand their way of writing and will be easy to understand . Enrolling in different forums that are in the language you want to learn will be of great aid to you .
Anyway , I was thinking maybe you can help me out with this latest one . I 'm supposed to do some research on eating customs around the world and I figured , instead of just doing a quick search on Google and grabbing something off a Wikipedia article , I 'd ask you for a more direct source of input on the habits of the English .
If I quote you on my work , I might score a few extra marks .
Proposal for the development of a sports activity .
Those are a few reasons why it is important for us as a healthy group of people to have facilities in which we can practice this kind of activities .
In my opinión running is one of the most helpful sports when it comes to start moving and getting fit , in particular for those people who have not been doing any kind of physical activity for a long time .
This activity would not demand huge amounts of money to be done and with a non - significant investment would help a large group of people who desperately need it .
To start running this community will need a few things .
Once people know all the benefits this sport has , they will need a space where to practice it comfortably .
With this in mind money would be spent on constructing a running rute where no - one would have to worry about traffic or obstacules in their way .
There are almost no contraindications to practise this sport so almost everybody in the town has the opportunity to try it at least once .
This activity not only improves your body and health but also helps you have positive thoughts making everyone feel happier .
Conclusión
In my opinion improving the practice of this sport will be a great investment for our community and will have a great impact on our health and in our everyday lives .
The reading passage mentions three ways to prevent cane toads from spreading , while the speaker offers three reasons to refutes the reading passage .
The first point , suggested by the lecturer , is that national fence can not stop cane toads from spreading .
Unless the national fence can prevent the eggs and young can toads from moving through the water way , the fence is useless .
Thus , the lecture disputes the idea mentioned in the article that building a national fence could avoid the spreading .
The lecturer 's second argument invovles capturing and destroying the toads by volunteers .
It is argued in the listening passage that untrained volunteers could harm the native frogs which are endangered .
In short , the lecturer questions what is stated in the reading passage that prevent the spreading by volunteers capturing the cane toads .
Finally , it is argued in the listening passage that disease - causing virus that killed the toads could be a disaster .
The lecturer says that if the virus was bring to the original habitats of cane toads in South America , it will cause ecological damage to the local ecosystem . To sum up , the lecturer doubts the way mentioned in the reading that specially designed virus could specifically harm cane toads and prevent them from spreading .
To conclude , the lecturer discords with the ideas in the passage by presenting three convincing reasons .
National fence , volunteers , and virus are not good solutions to the cane toads spreading problem .
" Mission : Impossible " soars again with stunning five outing !
It it hard to believe that Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise is still able to reinvent himself carry the weight of a blockbuster franchise like the " Mission : Impossible " series , much more so after considering the fact that he is now in his early fifties , and still looks as fresh as he did in the 25 years old " Days of Thunder " .
Finally , a special mention goes for Joe Kraemer 's superbly thrilling score , just a masterclass of old - school , kickass orchestral action music .
But it is also because of these set of beliefs , mostly of religious origins , that some societies fail to evolve and respond to the ever - changing needs of all of their people .
One of the main advantages of cutural practices is that they allow societies to maintain their identities and gain economic stability .
Progress and traditions are not opposites in a socie ty were respect and tolerance for others is the priority .
People who break the law , should be ordered to work in community in order to pay for their misdeeds , when they have done a minor offence or if they have acted unintentionally .
Nobody is sinless and people should not be treated as serious as being sent to jail .
This is unfair , because they do not do any harm to the environment nor to the society .
It is better that they do a certain amount of community work , for example clean their graffiti , which will teach them how hard it is to clean graffiti , and thus , prevent them from making new ones .
Working in the community is more adequate compared to sending people to prison when criminals have done a minor offence .
Everybody deserves freedom , despite its crimes .
Although their misdeeds should not be tolerated , I believe that had better do some community work .
For example , in Bulgaria , people who lay down and relax on the grass in the park are sent to jail for 6 years , because they are considered " doing serious damage to the environment and preventing the park from further development " .
Community service orders should be used when people have acted unintentionally and when they have conceded a minor offence , as this will help them realize their mistakes , without them being limited in freedom by being sent to prison .
This will help them realize their mistakes and thus , quit doing them .
The plot is about a teenage girl who moves in with her mother to their dream house , which was next to a home where a horrible double homicide had taken place in .
As the movie develops , it has lots of interesting turns that let the viewer form his / her own conclusions .
Although it had bad critics , the movie was well received by the audience ; not to mention Jennifer Lawrence 's appearance right after the hit of Hunger Games was great for advertising .
Actually I intend to study law but since there is no ' law ' in the subject choices so I chose economics .
Without law , this world that we are living in will not be in order and peace , but in chaos .
I believe that every human , organization and company has their own rights and it is in my duty to use my legal knowledge to help them from infringement of their rights .
My study plan is to untertake a pre - university programme locally to prepare myself for further studies overseas .
In my opinion , the exchange of thoughts and views between all these brilliant people is exactly where a totally new and creative idea will spark .
From a very young age children can gain basic computer skills through programmes that allow them to learn , draw , paint and play .
However , there are various negative aspects to using com - puters .
Social networking is a tool used by people all around the world .
However I think that this type of technology might be doing more harm than good .
All social networks have their own pros and cons but certainly there are some social networks that affect more than others .
In conclusion I can say that the social network that affects population the most is Facebook .
It affects our lives in many ways , including our communication , self- expression , bullying , isolations , friendships , and even our very own sense of humanity .
Facebook has more bad effects in adolescents than in adults , they are known to be more mature about what they post and how they interact online .
It is more likely that adults would , use their profile pictures as a way of casually showing themselves , their family , find new clients for their jobs or possibly a recent trip they took .
Comments that are left on their pages mean more to them than words said face to face
Adults need to teach teenagers the importance of not abuse from using social networks , specially Facebook .
Teachers at school may improve more restrictions that make teenagers avoid using social networks in an extremely way .
At work , bosses may reduce employee 's salaries if their job gets affected because of distractions that are produced by social networks .
Proposal to improve School 's facilities for language learners .
First , an inspection to the school 's facilities was organised , in order to assess the school premises .
Currently , each class is given to 50 students which limits their opportunities to experience one o one activities that enhance their learning process .
It would be advisable to accommodate classes in the main building that offers enough space for smaller classes .
Secondly , It was surprising to evidence an absence of Internet access in the computer room .
Even if the room counts with a considerable number of computers , the absence of Internet does not give students the opportunity to use the many websites useful to improve their language skills .
Therefore , I strongly recommend guaranteeing internet access which does not represent a high cost for the academic board .
The access will give learners the possibility to use technological tools that will ensure a better experience while learning languages .
Finally , authentic material in foreign languages was not found in the school 's library .
It is crucial to provide students with printed material in the target language .
Thus , I suggest to make subscriptions to international magazines in order to enrich the school 's library .
I strongly believe that if the suggestions made in this proposal are given attention , the service provided to language learners will be strengthen and enhanced .
How would the entire world in general and the mountaineering fraternity in particular , judge my decision ?
I could have been pulled over the snowy cliff by Joe 's fall , in my effort to pull him up instead .
Picking myself up slowly after the numbness around my waist and hip had subsided ; I knew I had little time to apportion blame to Joe or myself .
After all , we were in a team in search of personal glory to be the first to ever climb the west face of this Andes mountain !
I had to look to help ; there was little time to lose .
Ever since I started learning English I have found quite handy watching TV series , especially those which are perfectly subtitled , in order to follow the plot properly .
On the other hand , I have been in search of the series which catches my attention and it took me very long until I finally put my finger on it .
Although the story is focused on the Lord 's family , the service has an important part to play , as the world is changing continuously and the nobility is getting old - fashioned .
The main point in this series is that every character has been absolutely developed , with its own characteristics and personalities .
Even the background is cleverly chosen what enhances the intriguing and dramatic script .
Needless to say , the actors are sublime and they give their touch to their role , especially Maggie Smith , which is one of my favourite actress .
Because of all these reasons , I highly recommend taking into account Downton Abbey to be included in your top ten list .
My penultimate position was as chief executive of a company with photocomposition , which was followed by the creation of a publication service serving the " Sell Side " department of Pictet , then Helvea demonstrated my sense of organization and easy adaptation to new environment .
Furthermore , I am fluent in English language , with good writing skills .
Conscientious by nature , I always strive to be thorough in my work , to be diligent , and consistently completing my tasks .
NB : In addition , in the case of employment , I would receive an allowance of a participation of 50% of the salary for a period of two years .
About work , since you are a native speaker of English language and you have and idea about teaching English as a second language , you can apply for teaching centers that offer jobs for native - speakers of English language .
And it will be good preparation for your study at college .
The success of the soap opera depends on the theme , the people have to weather to relate to it or have interest on it .
As a typical Brazilian I have a favorite soap opera , is called Floribella .
The story is about a poor girl called Floribella she is an eccentric seamstress , she has amazing friend and they have a band together .
She starts to work for Mister Frederico , a young and wealthy man who has three brothers to take care .
He is arrogant but Flor is the only one who can calm him down in difficult situations .
She falls in love with him , but unfortunately he is engaged and his fiancée is an awful person who always try to humiliate Flor .
I 'm afraid to say that this soap opera does n't have a happy end and I did n't enjoy the end either , but I still recommend it because it 's a beautiful love story and the characters are really amusing and the story is funny and lovely .
Despite its end and all others odds that it may have , I 'm still a big fan of Floribella and I ca n't wait to watch it again on Netflix .
And by the way , the soundtracks are awesome , you 'll be addicted to them .
Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) is indicated in more than 90% of missions statements around the world .
As for my city , the mayor gives environment his top priority and a budgeted plan under the process of implementation .
awareness sessions have been made to explain the difference among re - use , recycle and reduce .
a different color trash bags were distributed to citizens to be used at home to separate the trash according to each material .
Also , Films on soaring birds were played to explain the importance of birds in cleaning the atmosphere .
It is worth to mention that schools are considering Environment subject is part of the education sytem that should be taught to students .
Finally , I 'm proud to say that taking care of the environment is part of my and my family daily life .
Trash distribution , using green products that repect the ozone layer , not wasting water and many other actions .
I am writing to apply for the position of assistant professor of English with an emphasis in nineteenth - century American literature that you advertised in the February 20XX MLA Job Information List .
Over the past five years , I have taught a variety English courses .
I have extensive experience working with ESL students , as well as students with a variety of learning disabilities , including dyslexia and dysgraphia , and disabilities like ADD and ADHD .
I pride myself in creating a classroom environment that accommodates the needs of my individual students while still promoting a high level of critical thought and writing skills .
Some of my most satisfying experiences as a teacher have come from helping struggling students to grasp difficult concepts , through a combination of individual conferences , class activities , and group discussion .
I argue that , rather than being submissive to the requirements of the editor or publisher , female authors in fact developed a more transparently reciprocal relationship between themselves and their readers than previously has been assumed .
Not so long ago I watched film called " 47 Ronin " .
The action takes place in Japan , in times of samurais and witches .
The main hero is a mysterious stranger , betrayed by everyone , sold into slavery , chosen by fate to administer revenge , will become one of 47 warriors that defy death .
Appearing from another world he will rise up against the darkness to protect his forbidden love .
I also liked the plot built on a base of a Japanese legend .
And I just could n't forget to mention beautiful decorations and realistic special effects .
A transportation vehicle that has changed people 's live .
Not only that , what prides itself as the most influential vehicle - as most public recognized - is the automobile .
There are people who have never ridden a bicycle , and people who have never been on an airplane but it would be hard to find a person who has never been in a car .
It is generally believed that the invention of car leads to the dispersion of the population out of urban centers , to the growth of the suburbs .
Prior to the automobile , is the horse and wagon life , it is not feasible for people to live far from their place of work .
Moreover , it leads to an important expansion in commerce , resulting in the growth of the ubiquitous shopping malls , department stores , serving as a powerful pull to tourism .
Being able to live far from one 's workplace , people could travel far and wide for pleasure and indulge themselves in a remarkable trip .
It may be for a day , a week , or a period of time .
In the urban city , the car is by far the most common mode of transportation and has greatly impacted the growth of the tourist industry .
Though being good enough , yet the growth of population and mobility do not tell the whole story .
This powerful vehicle is counted vital for another reason : being an indispensable factor in many aspects .
It is the key that supports many industrial fields , such as steel , machinery , plastic .
The whole business success would not have met perfection without the help of transportation to distribute their materials and commodities well .
Thanks to the speed , excitement , and convenience of the cars , our lives are enriched .
The newest Japanese restaurant in town - Ohana restaurant is the place to be on a Friday night .
The staff 's clothes are beautifully coloured and believe it or not , all of them are Japanese and can speak English fluently .
The moment you pass the huge wooden doors , the music sets you back in Meiji Era and you feel like you are about to meet a very important samurai .
JOb and social life both play important roles to put people 's lives together .
In my opinion , my social interaction balances my life more than does my working experience .
The companionship of our loved people is always the best solution to release our pressure .
For example , every day it seems that an extremely tight deadline is always chasing after me , and makes me breathless .
Meanwhile , I always feel exhausted and barely have any energy to talk with anyone after a long day from the work .
However , I always can recover my energy after having a little nice chat with my family or friends .
Therefore , the happiness brought from my social connections helps to alleviate the stress related to work .
Take my yoga class for example .
Both learning new knowledge and making new friends make me feel delighted .
Therefore , an active social life not only benefits my mental health but also keep me in a good mood .
Lastly , some people may think that co - workers naturally melt into our social life since we spend so much time in the workplace .
However , most of the time people keep a good relationship with their co - workers in order to accomplish their common task harmoniously .
For example , we talk about something trivial , such as gripes , and gossip , with our colleagues .
Therefore , the more deeply our emotions interact , the more tremendously our happiness is influenced .
In conclusion , because of intimate support , growth in life experiences , and emotional interaction , I agree with the statement that the social life has more of an effect on my happiness than does my occupation .
In other words , even though I can get temporary happiness from accomplishing a work task or gaining a compliment from my co - workers , personally I think I obtain more permanent enjoyment and satisfaction from engaging and interacting with the people that I love .
As a result , I believe that my social life influences my personal happiness more than does my job .
When I opened the door imagine my surprise ... There was a large box standing in front of the door , addressed to me , while I had never received packages before !
The only post ever sent to me was an anniversary card , sent by my grandmother before she passed away .
Still a bit surprised , I grabbed the box up , which proved to be no picnic , as it felt as if it had been filled with rocks .
If only I had looked a bit better where I placed my feet ...
Children and elders ca n't have a driving license , so if they need to go somewhere , using public transport is their only option .
Travelling by car is also very detrimental for the environment .
In big cities , the air is very polluted because there are too many cars . Travelling by public transport lowers the impact on the environment , something that most people are aware of , but still they prefer to use their own vehicle .
There are some reasons why people leave shop in a bad mood , or even do n't want to get in them .
For others it is overall a pleasant experience they can not enjoy as much as they would like .
Firstly , shopping may be uncomfortable , because more often than not we can hear there tiring music , saleswomen can be too intrusive and the queue usually are very long .
Sometimes women go to the store , just to watch the new stuff , to look around and questions asked by sellers make us angry .
It is said that the man , who go shopping more than one hour is angry and tired .
Sometimes it is also a trouble for women , who want to go shopping with her partner .
To sum up , doing shopping is inevitable , so we can make everyday shopping more enjoyable .
For exapmle , we can take at least one family member with us .
Going from one store to another can waste your time , cost you a lot in gas , as well as mentally and physically exhaust you ; when it comes to products that your regularly use , buying in bulk is the best option you have , since that way you get a bigger quantity for a lower price ; or just choose online shopping - is a great way to make your purchases from the comfort of your own home , without having to go out on a rainy day , deal with noisy ( and sometimes even smelly ) crowds , spend money on gas and wait in huge lines .
First of all I would like to begin with giving some information about the city where the place that you will be visiting belongs to .
The city of Istanbul is one of the famous and crowded cities of Turkey which constitutes the country 's economic , cultural , and historical heart .
The population of Istanbul is over 20 million and Istanbul is among the largest cities in the world by population within city limits .
Historical Peninsula is the centre of ancient Istanbul where the four major empires had been ruled from .
In order to give brief information on them I would like to touch on some of them .
Hagia Sophia was built as a cathedral in 537 , converted to a mosque after the conquest of Istanbul , now is being used as a museum .
Topkapi Palace was built in 1470 's and Ottoman Empire was ruled from this palace for 380 years .
Basilica Cistern was built in the 6th century and is the largest of several hundred ancient cisterns that still lie beneath the city of Istanbul ; size of 143 by 65 meters , with capacity of holding 80,000 cubical meters of water .
Beyazit Tower is 85 meter located in the courtyard of Istanbul University 's main campus in Beyazıt Square .
Actually I was asked to recommend only one place , but Historical Peninsula is already an area where those historical distincts got together .
I hope the given information is useful for you .
I am writing in regard to some important documents I left in your hotel room during my stay .
Last week , I joined the C&A meeting as one of the major speakers .
The following conversation was so engaging that I forgot the time and , as a result I got late for my departure to Chicago .
I am not completely certain , but I remember that the last time I kept them was near the tiny blue table located at the left corner of the room .
If you found them , could you send them to my office by post ?
Having goals in life will make ones ' life meaningful and purposeful .
They are studying in an English university abroad and becoming a programmer .
Being able to study in an English university will give me the opportunity to get a better job and an exciting experience .
Secondly , the experiences one gets from a multicultural medium is very valuable and makes one more matured .
there are many reasons why I want to be a programmer .
primarily , because being a developer is my dream job and secondly because developers make a lot of money .
I wanted to be a programmer since I was 14 years old .
For example , if I want to marry in the future , I have to be able to send my kids to a decent school and provide them with what they want . not to mention wedding party expenses .
To sum it up , graduating from an English university and then becoming a programmer are currently my mine aims .
Having a good job and a high salary will make my life richer and more awarding .
With the advent of individually owned vehicles like the car , an individual 's dependence on public transport has certainly reduced .
However , with that being said , in my opinion , there is still a lot of future for public transport .
First of all , from a cost perspective , public transport is much cheaper compared to a car , especially when a cost reduction concept like ' car pooling ' is not followed .
The financial benefit that public transport gives to the common man is second to none , especially in common situations like long distance commutes for daily work .
In addition , from a ' time savings ' angle , increased usage of public transport results in reducing traffic and helping people reach their destinations quicker by avoiding being delayed in traffic jams and lights .
From an environmental standpoint , use of public transport ensures that carbon emissions from automobiles are prevented helping in preserving the balance of nature even in big cities like Tokyo and Delhi where the carbon emissions are very high .
However , there 's always a channel that sends out a new episode .
Besides that , it 's very likely that you can find some programmes you like between all the trash because of the wide variety .
During the past five years I have been organizing several events not just in England but also in the United States and Portugal .
However I have also previously worked with older people .
As a matter of fact when you get to know me better , I am very helpful .
Today i want to talk with you about the process of making bank notes .
We use cash everyday and it is of great importance to our daily life .
Firstly , something about designing must be taken into consideration .
Not only the background colour but also the artwork we need to choose .
Apart from that , we also need to design security issues .
After that , we now need to print it out .
Every bank note should be coloured both sides and we even need to use special ink in case of been copied .
Some good quality sheets will be packaged and distributed to the market but the bad sheets would be disposaled .
Maybe there would be some partially damaged sheets so the bank notes will be separated into good and bad .
The main features of these bank notes are good quality and effort made by bank workers .
So do n't look down on the bank notes in your hand now , they are precious .
It went out of control and they started fighting .
Peter tryed to stop them but it was impossible , so he tried to find somebody to separate them .
He did n't found anyone so he grabbed Louis and tried to calm them down .
Lucas wanted to apologise and forget what happened but Louis was really hungry , so Lucasdecided to go home .
The ball went straight the police station window and broke the glass .
Peter got so scared that ran away .
Louis got caught and told the cops that Lucas was the one that had broke it .
The police went to school to talk with Lucas and try to find a fare punishment .
Peter knew that Lucas was n't guilty but he and Louis were best friends since the elementary school , he had to do his decision and he only had two minutes until they took Lucas to the police station .
Peter got up and told the cops what really happened , Louis tried to excuse himself but it was too late .
Louis had to pay the window and also clean the school 's canteen for two months , but he realized that what he did was wrong so he apologised to Lucas .
It seemed that the man in the wheelchair was looking for something but suddenly , he took a couple of books and put into a hidden pocket in his wheelchair .
Angie and the store detective ran after " the false disabled " but he was younger and obviously , he ran faster .
When it seemed impossible to catch him , a girl , who was crossing the street in a wheelchair , crashed into the thief and he fell down on the paviment .
Because of this , the store detective could catch the thief and recovered all books .
To express her gratitude , Angie called the girl as " honorary customer " of her bookshop and gave her a crime novel collection like a present .
When the American series ' House ' was firstly broadcasted on TV , it immediately hooked the audience .
The unusual scenario and the great actor Hugh Laurie made the result really innovative for a TV series .
He only agrees to take over cases nobody else could solve and most of the time he succeeds .
Due to an unsuccessful surgery he had on his leg , he is addicted to painkillers which he makes several attempts to detox from motivated by his only friend Dr. Wilson , but he never really wants to so he gets addicted again .
Nevertheless , he is willing to do literary anything to save a patient 's live , although sometimes he goes too far .
The series had a great appeal on many countries , which is demonstrated by the eight seasons that were produced .
His revolutionary behaviour and the fact that he let nobody restrain him are the reasons for the series huge success .
Also , the medical cases are intriguing and although someone with no medical knowledge may not understand much , the struggle to save a person 's life captures everyone 's interest .
The innovative aspect of ' House ' is that he often takes illegal action , for example breaking into a patient 's house to investigate environmental factors , which may have caused the particular disease and hardly ever is he punished for it .
I believe it well deserved such popularity , as apart from its scenario , it was on the whole qualitative .
My only objection is that it sometimes went too far which made the audience dislike Dr. House .
Nevertheless , it distinct from other medical series as he constantly thinks out of the box .
The first time I knew about volleyball , I was in my last Secondary School year and we were invited to cheer up a local team during a Regional Tournament in Lima , Peru .
I was amazed with the atmosphere at the Coliseum , with its shiny wooden court , the noisy people around it , that sharp sound of the referees 's whistles ... Then I decided to take up the game .
Once I got fitter enough , I started enjoying the game , learning its strategies , developing personal and group skills and having fun at the same time .
I would strongly recommend the youth to take up this sport .
The aim of this proposal is to present suggestions regarding the ways in which the extra funding could be used if the benefit of the students and , indirectly , in the benefit of the local community .
Needless to say , in order to combat the rising tide of the social problems in Hampshire , the Education Authority decided to increased funds for the educational sector .
Sportive activities might boots the student 's overall condition and this is the reason why they are necessary .
A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeares ' more enjoyable than solely studying them will .
Cookery classes are very important because students here are young adults that need to have basic skills such as cooking or order to manage themselves and live an independent life .
Cooking classes will helps students spend less money on eating out and they will start eating healthier because by making their own food they will be more aware of what they are eating .
DYI Classes
As most college students will soon leave for university and will live in dorms , without their parents , they are oblidged to solve malfunctions by themselves .
The information they acquired during these courses will help them for the rest of their lives .
These courses will develop the civic sense of students and they will start involving actively in society .
The Education Authority believes that social problems are linked with a decrease in participation in extra- curricular activities and it suggests that the college should use extra funding to solve this issue .
Today 's television is the paradigm of our society , because of dozens of new channels constantly popping up and only a very few controls are done on the quality of what it 's actually broadcast .
So TV , which could be an invaluable source of information and entertainment , actually is becoming a big issue to the development of our society and new generations in particular .
The potential risks for our new generations
Having an easy access to such a rich offer before having developed the ability to operate correct choices or filter the information received , our kids and juniors are constantly under attack of dangerous behaviour models , being attracted by the ones who seem the most winning and cool ones , without any chance to distinguish if they can be taken as a guide to their growth or not .
The absence of the parents or the fact they usually have no control nor way to drive their choices makes me very worried about the future of our society .
It 's not too late , though , to try to have our beloved TV back to the importance which radio had for our parents and grandparents , we only need to see it as a potential new social problem and start a process of control and continuous improvement , maybe giving the most virtuous networks the chance to be highlighted .
I believe that if public transport has no future , then our environment will not have it either .
However , the use of public transport , especially in high density cities , allows people to save time while commuting to their study or workplace , as trains and trams do not get stuck in traffic jams .
It not only helps reducing pollution , but also allows users to save money , in a world where the cost of gasoline is exponentially increasing .
I believe that people should limit the use of their cars only to special occasions , such as road trips or long - weekend leisure activities .
Only by doing so , we will help to preserve our atmosphere free of CO2 emissions , and all the grim consequences they have .
I read about your summer camp in the internet and I would love to work with you .
I m 16 years old , tall , extroverted , very energetic and cheerful and friendly .
I love kids , and i m very outgoing .
I think I can be very helpful to your camp , helping you taking care of the kids and also helping you in the kitchen because I really love to cook .
When I was younger i went to a camp , and it was one of the best memories I have so it would be really great to know I would make some kids make the same way .
I really hope you accept me in your camp , and I wait with excitment your response .
Today , I 'd like to share with you a small but historic story , also together with my own view on it .
I hope you would like it .
In the historical river , there was a dynasty called Jin , during which this story took place .
In his early age , he lost his mother to illness .
As a result , in order to be sure that he could get the same love from mother like other children , his father married another woman .
On the contrary , the fact was inconsistent with what he expected .
Not concerning the harsh environment but her own appetite , she commanded Lucky Wang make a delicious meal with fresh fish .
In desperation , he stepped to the river bank .
So depressed was Lucky Wang that he simply lay on the ice with weeping .
It was exactly when he was hesitating whether went home to face the beatings from his stepmother or not that two craps leaped up out of the ice and flopped onto the bank in front of him .
Surprised and delighted , the boy took the fish home and prepare delicious fish soup for his stepmother .
After listening to the small story , some people were deeply moved by the happy ending , however , others thought it was unrealistic .
No matter what the fact was , or even it never happened , the story just wanted to emphasize the importance of Filial Piety .
Even if it was a fiction , the goal to make all the people in the society be filial could also be achieved , which would keep the society harmonious as well as orderly for a long time .
Also , it was the governors ' terminal purpose .
At this day and age it is falling on the taxpayers .
It does not boost their confidence in future perspectives .
We often hear than no obstacle is ever insurmountable , however , is it true ?
Sooner or later we will face the music .
Only in that moment we will understand that we are one of the millions pensioners who need a lot of different services to live as fulfilled and independent life as we deserve .
First of all , it will be a good idea to encourage young people to start saving money as soon as possible .
In such a way they can remain alert and no matter what will happen .
Secondly , the state can take 5 percent from every salary .
The pensioners will receive their money when they retire .
It will be long - lasting benefit for both parts .
Our state will have a large sum of money which is an invaluable source .
On the other hand the pensioners will be sure in their future .
Everyone should think not just about his benefit , but about others .
However , step by step we will work our way up .
Firstly , I have to say that I disagree about the statement " There is no future for public transport " . I think public transport has lots of advantages , more than travelling by car .
You only have to be aware of when leaves your public transport and be there a couple of minutes before .
You can relax when you are travelling , listening music or reading a book .
Maybe you spend more hours than travelling by car but I think it worth it , because you can save money .
I usually travel by public transport and it is the half of the cost than if I do it by car .
So , I think the statement would be like this " There is no future for travelling by car , because public transport is so much more convenient and cheaper " .
I 'm not a huge fan of sports in general , but I do take pleasure in engaging in smaller scale basketball matches , most of which would probably fall into the so - called ' street ' category , or streetball to be more specific .
It takes a higher level of creativity and spontaneity to succeed in it than your usual basketball match , since its flexible rules , no - coach system , intensified relationship between the player and the crowd , and reduced number of participants widen and complexify its field of possible actions .
The ' style ' factor of it ( or " aesthetic value " if you will ) also plays an important role , again , intensifying the relationship between team and the crowd while granting the pleasure of contemplating and executing flowing movement sequences , finishing a play , or just stylishly mocking your opponent .
Not to mention the socially bonding ability of it , while on game tension between the opposing teams is somewhat inevitable , the irreverent , human , no strings attached nature of streetball events always compensate its negative aspects ( which , upon closer inspection , reveal to be shared between every single sports event ) .
It is a fun , culturally - enriching experience which I recommend anyone interested in going beyond the competitive aspect of sports to engage .
Moreover , they often smoke and drink alcohol , which produces serious physical and mental diseases ( CasaColumbia , 2007 ) .
Furthermore , teenagers have changed their life styles and now they are generally sedentary , since they use their computers or watch TV all day long instead of doing sports .
Nevertheless , governments claim that they nowadays are more aware of the importance of health than in the past .
For instance , in Chile the programme Elige Vivir Sano tries to improve the eating habits of young people in educational institutions , where fun activities are promoted to students by integrating healthy living ( Elige Vivir Sano , 2012 ) .
On the one hand , public transport is more convenient for large cities as it provides service to a larger number of people and we avoid traffic jams and the need to find parking spots , besides the fact that we wo n't get worried about leaving our cars parked on the street and , when we come back , the car could have been robbed or stolen .
On the other hand , cars tend to pollute more than electric trains and such problem ought to be taken into consideration when someone has to decide between using public transport or a car .
Public transport has been improved to such an extent that nowadays it is probably competing with private transport .
Although we can choose more destinations and it is more comfortable , prices are not competitive enough to definitely substitute the car .
Without a doubt , long distance journeys are best carried out by plane .
When considering the bus , users feel that it does not offer any advantages compared to the car and it is taken when no other option is possible .
If not , they would not make the investment of a car , pay its maintenance cost and fuel .
Indeed , the public transport cost for the same journey done by car hardly recovers the amount invested .
More and more , the oil shortage makes prices for fuel increase so does for transport ; economic policy of importing countries tend to establish saving measures in order to be strategically less dependent .
Moreover , considering pollution , private transport seems to be much more difficult to manage because it is an individual decision .
To sum up , future generations will have to face the challenge of a sustainable world and surely public transport will play an important role .
I found out about this new shop from friends and pictures online so I decided to come check it out for myself .
As I had arrived just as they open at 1 pm , I had the whole place to myself .
The majority of the space was taken up by a U shape marble counter where customers can sit and observe their desserts being made .
The patio is probably a bit narrow to place tables outside but people can go out and enjoy the view when the weather is cooler .
I started chatting with the chef who told me that he wanted to start a dessert lounge for people to relax and enjoy desserts .
He felt that a lot of places out there tend to make the experience too rush where you have to line up for an hour and finish eating in like 20 minutes before they kick you out .
There are currently 9 desserts offered on the menu with prices ranging from $ 108 to $ 138 while there is also the famous Improvisation dessert for 2 at $ 328 . I could n't decide what to get at first because they all sounded so interesting so I asked the chef for recommendations .
He recommended the Bamboo Charcoal as the theme is chocolate which was perfect for me !
Each dessert comes with some appetizers to cleanse our palate .
The test tube contained watermelon juice with sea salt which was very refreshing to drink in the summer heat .
Bamboo Charcoal ( $ 138 ) - I got to watch the chef as he prepared my dessert at the counter and I was getting more and more excited to taste his artful presentation as it came to life !
It literally looked like a piece of abstract art painting .
This was a chocolate theme dessert with bamboo charcoal ice cream , chocolate ice marshmallow , chocolate caviar and raspberry sorbet .
I did n't know what charcoal ice cream would taste like but it was actually chocolate mixed with a bit of charcoal .
The chocolate flavor was rich but not too sweet while the raspberry sorbet was delightfully tart and tangy .
My surprise favorite was the microwave sponge cake that the chef added at the last minute .
He told me that this is a new method of making sponge cake in the microwave that results in very fluffy texture which would be hard to achieve in a traditional oven due to temperature constraint and timing .
The dessert also came with a choice of coffee or tea so I opted for the Lime Flower & Lavender Tea at their recommendation as well .
My tea was brought out with teapot and a small hourglass timer where I am supposed to wait 3 minutes before I should pour the tea .
The smell was wondrous from the lavender while the flavor was almost mint - like and refreshing to drink .
They also offered me some honey to add into my tea when I thought it was n't flavorful enough at first .
Verdict - I was very impressed with the desserts at ATUM Desserant as they were delightful for both the eyes and the mouth !
The price was n't cheap for dessert but if you take into the entire experience and compared to what you pay for drinks at a bar or lounge , it 's pretty comparable actually .
They also told me that they plan on introducing a new tea set menu during the day so stay tune !
As the days go by , more discoveries are being unearthed in a rapid pace .
Imagine looking at Shakespeare in his English class , Einstein in his first science class and Picasso picking up his paintbrush for the very first time .
Nonetheless , there are some disadvantages . If a person possesses the magic power that is too powerful for others to defend themselves from , he or she can basically rule the world .
Additionally , terrible wars will break out if one side of the magic possessors get greedy and try to take away other people 's powers .
It has been a long while since I last met . you and dad .
Undeniably , the food culture disparity between China and Japan is tremendous , although our ancestors were originated from the same ethic .
But still , our customs had evovled a lot .
Due to the geographicall conditions where Japan is located aside Pacific Ocean , people here are adapted to eat raw fish and would like to put it as a main dish to serve customers in most restaurants .
Unfortunately , I do n't like eating raw foods , especially for under - cooked fish .
It makes me arouse a feeling of nausea .
So , I can only have cup noodle for those nights when I leave school at 8:00 p.m.
progress of integrating to their culture .
Last week , we went to The Mountain Fuji .
The mountain was half - melted with glacier on top .
I have never seen such scenery like that in my country since the climate in South China is humid and hot .
The same goes to me .
When we play football , we are definitely will cooperate with the other teammates in order to be the winner .
The one who is in the back position will try their hard to block the opponent teammates from scoring while those who play in the attacking position will make up their strategy in order to score .
This clearly shows that football needs a strong cooperation from all of the team 's players .
My advice to those who are starting this sport is to practise a lot as football needs an unstoppable practice to master the game and be the king of field .
My second advice for them is to always have a cooperative game with the teammates .
The worst player is those who do not put their trust in the other teammates and the best one is them who put their full trust in their teammates .
Scuba diving obviously is one of the most exciting and thrilling sports on earth .
I surely embrace the fact that the diving community has recently been exploding with many new enthusiast members , not only bringing a unique experience into your life , but also enhancing awareness about environmental conservation issues towards a broad public .
The downside of this is that hordes of eager newly trained divers populate the underwater world , often with little clue of the life - threatening risks that they are facing .
From my point of view it should rather be seen as a license to learn .
Consequently I see a pretty massive responsibility for the instructors and dive masters in telling the newcomers about the risks of their sport .
To my great astonishment I witnessed a completely different pattern of behaviour time and again .
I saw dive - buddy 's and even professional dive masters pushing and stimulating fresh divers to extend their limits in order to dive to that spectacular wreck or enter that mysterious cave when they simply do not have the appropriate training for it .
You can imagine that it is really traumatic for divers when they encounter a corpse in the water , not to mention the great distress such a disaster gives to the family that was left behind .
The bottom line is : get as much out of your diving experiences as you can , but stay safely within your own boundaries set by your personal education and practice .
I love to teach because I love to learn and love to share my knowledge with others .
A successful communication between different cultures will happen only when we express oueselves precisely and interpret the information accurately .
Students should master language skills , with which the students can achieve their academic goals .
Acquiring a language and culture is a long - term process , which includes learning , practicing , making mistakes and correcting .
As a language teacher , I hope my students will have a deeper and broader understanding of this language , their interest in this language will be stimulated by the course and learn the language constantly .
Fame is a side effect of job in the media and so is spine disease for people who work in an office or threat to life or health for firefighters .
It would be completely pointless if we were judging people on the basis of job they have .
Everyone is equal so everyone deserves the same .
People who decide to work in show - business or media have to be aware of having less privacy .
what is inseparable part of this kind of occupations .
Because of their fame , they also give employment to other people like paparazzi , journalists .
We live in times where people are very curious about other people 's lives so above - mentioned occupations are necessary ,
but let 's think ... is it really so interesting to know , for example , what Madonna 's second husband eat for breakfast ?
Would we , not - famous , people want that kind of interest ?
Let 's step into famous people shoes .
So let politicians , film stars , singers and others be .
Michael had been running on fumes all week .
Besides being in charge with organizing his younger sister 's surprise birthday party he had also been put in charge with the entire Information Technology department of the company he worked for .
His former boss retired and nominated him for the position , claiming he was more than qualified and had the adequate skill set in order to keep the department on track as well as making any necessary changes .
The truth was he had been expecting a promotion in a nearby future just not in this precise week .
Michael did n't mean to sound ungrateful , because he was delighted , but the timing was n't anything but the worst .
The only problem was that it seemed nothing was going to work on his favour , the servers had crashed and he was the one who had to fix it .
As soon as one problem in the company would be solved another one just as infuriating would come up at the party planning .
He was exhausted so he decided to go home , let his mother deal with the party and any problems would be taken care of by his co - workers .
It was risky ; he knew it but had no energy left in him .
The scope of this report is to give readers an overview in the historical development of water treatment , the changing perception of standardization of water treatment , and the continuous improvement of the technologies that are involved due to the growing lists of water quality parameters to be monitored .
Clean and adequate water supply system is vital aspect in public health and social prosperity .
It is essential for all forms of life by which water participates in numerous biochemical reactions such as distribution of nutrients , removal of metabolic waste , and body temperature regulation .
Water treatment must meet requirements for public and industrial standards .
Mithen 's ( 2010 ) researches show that most ancient civilizations inaugurated themselves near water resources and successful civilizations were dependent upon delicate systems of water transport .
Although an understanding of water quality was not well understood , the importance of water was apparent to our ancestors .
80 - 20 BC , wrote forty books of world history and in the translated version by Oldfather ( 1939 ) , Siculus provided early documents of purifying water such as boiling and sand filtration , dating all the way back to 2000 BC in ancient Greek .
Since microbiology was yet studied , people at that time could not distinguish between clean and polluted water .
The main precaution measure was purely by judging turbidity of the water and this false practice had remained ever since , even nowadays .
It took years for people to recognize that their sense of smell and vision were not reliable judges of water quality .
The development of qunats ( Figure 1 ) began about 2500 years ago in Iran , a sloping tunnels drilled into the foot of a hill that contained groundwater .
Unlike the past , where people have little knowledge about sanitation and hygiene ; with better scientific understanding and public education , people learn to think and evaluate the quality of the water that they are drinking and using every day .
The history of water treatment continued in 1670 , as two Dutch glasses makers investigated on magnification glasses led to the invention of the microscope .
This scientific discovery broken down the barrier and enables biologist to observe organism that were invisible to the naked eye ( Figure 2 ) .
The " Chachas " is a restaurant situated in a mall in a fringe area of Bern .
People of all ages and cultures eating there .
The restaurants ' slogan is " positive eating " and they definitely live out that phrase .
The large dining room with high ceiling is what catches everybody 's eye , especially if you set your foot into the restaurant for the first time .
This being said , you can imagine the atmosphere being comfortably airy .
Sitting at any table you can watch the chefs preparing the fresh food .
Assembled around those long tables , you will find the smaller tables and even a cosy lounge for people waiting for a free table .
The menu offers a wide range of mouth - watering thai - food dishes including starters , curries , noodles and desserts .
Another aspect I would like to emphasise on is the service .
The waiters go out of their ways ' .
They are courtous and industrious .
And as I know that my classmates prefer light and healthy food , I highly recommend going to the " Chachas " restaurant .
There has been substantial attention to writers ' self - presentation and identity in online social media recently ; Boyed ( 2008 ) studied how teens present themselves online through Myspace site ; Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) reports that people illustrate a different identity in facebook through using " a different language and writing style " .
Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) refers to the " forms of participation " in a social media and having the sense of audience in mind as the key elements that can possibly change " the way people think of themselves " that changes the way they present themselves and their identity online thereby .
He refers to using nicknames , for example , as a way of self - expression that can shape the audience 's mind and interpretation of writers ' identity .
Lee ( 2014 ) defines three ways of self - presentations in most social media : ( 1 ) " online profile " ( p. 97 ) , that is the " entry point to social networking " .
Examining teens ' identity construction in social media , he states that profile is where teens " express salient aspects of their identity for others to see and interpret " ( 2008 : 129 ) ; ( 2 ) " continuous status updating " that is updating about life and sharing experiences from the " first person " point of view and ( 3 ) " visual representation " that is " visual images " ( p. 98)(emphasized as in original ) .
Continuous updating , as a way of self - presentation , is one of the features of blog writing by which blog - writers can share their emotional experiences and views with the audience .
If the weblog - writers prefer presenting the world from their own angle , through using the first person pronoun , or tell their stories through the readers ' eyes , by involving other grammatical subjects , is among the focuses of this study .
The children were playing outside , old and new couples were enjoying their love and everything seemed to be absolutely bright .
They had plans for the future before .. he thought he would have married her .
And then severything had crashed .
Michael tried not to think about it and to listen instaed to what she was saying ...
Her voice was weak and fleble while she said " .. and I was really depressed , you know and then I thought ... we always talked about going in India ... and I thought ... maybe we could fix everything .. so .. I'm just asking .. will you go with India with me ? "
But suddenly he thought he was really angry with her .
" I 'm sorry , but I do n't want to hear from you anymore " he said , and then stood up and without watching her walked out of the bar .
As you know I spent last month in Eastern Europe working for a similar cultural organization and I have a hands - on experience in organising a cultural festival and particularly musical concert .
I loved my job there and if I only had an opportunity to do it again , I definitely would .
During my staying there I was responsible for taking care of musicians and contacting media .
What I especially loved about my job there , was the opportunity to work in such a diverse group of people .
I also appreciated much the practical experience I could get there - how to organise job at the office so that everything goes smoothly and everyone gets what they want , how to use social media for advertising and promotion , how to communicate with press and television etc .
It is known that gossip magazines are bought by lots of people who are interested in what these people do , the kind of clothes they wear or even the tattoos they have .
This happens because some people is famous just because they have had an affair with a singer or a footballer , so the only thing people want to know about them is if that is true or not , and when it happened .
In the case of politicians , I do n't mind what they do in their holdidays , for example , if they work properly when they have to .
But I think there is an exception : monarchy .
I think Royal Family is an exception because they are supported by all the citizens , so I think we ( as citizen ) have the right to know eveything they do if we want .
It happens that one day a friend of mine took me to a Film Club session .
Meanwhile , Elen was going to receive a birthday present from her boyfriend , Ken : a house for both to live .
At first , Ken , had thought about giving some cruise tickets as a present .
A house for them to live !
Ken was not a small guy , short hair , sharp teeth and nose , light skin , blond hair and sky - blue eyes .
That day was the day , Elena 's birthday , and Ken was n't sure how to give that massive present when suddenly he had an excellent idea .
When Elena took it off she was blown away , completely amazed with what she saw .
Elena could n't be happier with the situation .
That morning , Michael woke up full of energy , and feeling very optimistic about his first day in his new job .
Every single detail should be perfect to get the best first impression .
-You only have one opportunity to cause a good first impression- he said to himself .
When he was totally satisfied with his look he turned on and off the light of his bedroom eight times .
When he arrived the receptionist told him to go to his boss office .
-Yes , come in , please- .
He liked her at first .
She was a very kind and intelligent woman , and Michael was sure that she was going to be a perfect boss and they will work very easily together .
After the meeting and when he was leaving he turned back and said : -
And congratulations for the baby!- His boss looked at him in anger:- Do you think that I am pregnant?- .
-No , no , I mean ... , I do n't think you are pregnant at all- .

Other modern malls are located in the suburbs but do n't worry , our city has an excellent public transport service to get there .
When the weather is good , especially during spring , market street are really popular .
It is celebrated on the mother 's day on May , the first Sunday and it is located in the city 's longest avenue , around a kilometre plenty of flowers where you can make your own bouquet for your mother 's present .
These are some ideas to enjoy shopping while you are visiting our city but there are much more to discover !
Yes , that 's true that the car is far more convenient than the public transport .
When you 're driving your own car you are getting a lot of comfort .
You are sitting on a comfortable seat .
And you never , ever , will contact with other people .
You have not wait till it arrives and it is never late .
Your car will always go to the right place -- no transport changes , no awkward routes .
But -- will it always be the best choice ?
When you want to travel the world or just going to visit your parents , which are two thousand miles from you , it would be better to take a bus or a train .
So in that case it 's better to leave your car at home .
And what if the car you 're driving will break ?
Just imagine that you are sitting in the broken car , at night , without any sign of a car service for fifty miles around you !
High cost of fuel will definitely be the lesser evil in this situation .
On short distances , maybe one or two hundred miles , a car is ideal .
But if you take a big journey alone , you 'd better take an old good bus , just like 100 years ago .
People would say that travelling on public transport it is the future for our lives .
But sincerely there is no future at all for it , as our lives nowadays are becoming more a more demanding in terms of multitasking , goal seekers and family conciliation .
Public transport offers a range of timetables for trains , buses or metro , but when it comes to deal with the day - to - day tasks we very often find travelling by our own car it is the easiest way .
For instance , travelling with children it is very annoying on public transport due to all the security issues involved .
Waiting at the bus station for our next bus after just roughly missing the last one , being stuck in the middle of a crowd trying to reach the same train as everyone else , does n't make us life any easier at all .
At the en of the day we decide to use our car , as the way we live today combining work , family and hobbies all at once , cars becoming mobile houses seem to be our best option .
You wanted to know what I was said to do before and during the concert , so I try to explain everything .
The concert took place in Los Angeles , it was a month ago as I think . You can be sure that I had a time of my life .
Everything was so exciting about helping at this concert .
I had to take care of other volounteers .
Dealing with other people is the hardest part , escpecially when they 're the same age as you .
There were people from Russia , Germany , Brasil .
That was really great to meet them and to talk with them .
Before the concert started , me and my co - workers had to clean the stage , set up the equipment and make sure everything works well : the sound , the lightning and the instruments .
I particularly enjoy the sense of freedom that it gives me : there 's nothing better than being out on the water with only the sound of the waves , and of the wind on the sails .
In my experience I found that people either consider sailing a very boring sport , or a very dangerous one ;
Indeed people can get bored while sailing , if they just sit and do n't interact with the rest of the crew ,
Sailing is all about cooperation , and to really enjoy it one needs to do it regularly , to be able get to know the crew and find the most suitable role on the deck .
Being a good sailor does n't mean knowing all about it , the point of sails , the winds , and so on , for me a good sailor is someone that knows the boat s / he 's sailing on , and is able to deal with all the possible situations and also kind of people s / he can possibly have to deal with .
So the most important piece of advice I would give to everyone is : try ,
and if the first time is not so good , try again : in different weather conditions , with different people , and different kind of boats .
Maybe you will not get addicted to it as much as I am , but I 'm sure you will have a great time , and in the worst case you will have the chance to meet wonderful people .
First of all public transport is far more convenient for people in big cities .
Nowadays environmental pollution is also important that 's why public transport should be promoted as environmentally friendly way of transport .
Not always car is much more convenient , for example in a big city it is far more convenient to use underground than a car during the rush hour .
When we use public transport we can read a newspaper or book and when we driving a car it 's impossible .
In my opinion nowadays driving a car is very stressful because of traffic intensity .
Driving a car is also more tiring , driver must be concentrated all the time .
Of course not always public transport is more convenient .
When we want to go on a weekend trip to the countryside car is irreplecable for families with children or animals .
Also go on holidays by car can be very comfortable .
With car we are more independent than with public transport .
There are many pros and cons but for sure we ca n't say that there is no future for public transport .
This summer I am bringing a group of 12 to 14 year - old students to Athens and I am looking for suitable accommodation .
At present I am uncertain about the number of the students , but it will probably be about 15 .
While we are there , we not only want to look at the many attractions in the city , but we would like to visit some of the beautiful places nearby , so we are looking for a reasonable priced hotel , in the city centre , with good transport links .
During our stay we require the following : twin - bedded rooms , in the same hotel , breakfast and on occasion , evening meal .
Furthermore I would like to ask you if there are any individuals who can be able to look after groups like us ?
Also it would be great if you could inform me of some special discounts , such as cheaper air travelling .
The final section of this proposal makes some recommendations about what should be done to elevate the website aesthetic and improve user - friendliness .
A survey was conducted among the 200 people who filled the complaints .
The majority of people were of opinion that the site was clunky and hard to use and nearly two thirds of the participants considered that the design needs to be modernised .
Others problems cited included pretty low uptime of the website , connection issues and login problems , particularly correct credentials not working .
Implement a tutorial to facilitate the usability for new users , and also make it possible to retake the tutorial as per user request .
Conduct a survey on a minimum of one thousand people on what features should the website include .
Although it had been a tiring day she was very pride of that little sheet of paper .
No one could have imagined that she was such a brilliant person and when she gave the article to the boss the latter was quite astonished .
The next days the boss ordered her to write an article about the natural beauties of Colombia , a little State located in South America .
She used to live in a flat so she had never disovered how much the world was different and beautiful .
That evening she met with a local guide she was invited to taste the local food and to dance with the traditional clothes of that friendly civilization .
The following day she came back to London where all her family was waiting for her since they werevery curious about the weird Alison 's trip .
All over the world people of different ages are very fond of sport and games .
It gives us much pleasure and many moments of joy .
They prefer reading interesting articles about athletes and sport events , but they do n't go in for sports .
There are a lot of kinds of sports such as swimming , wrestling , cycling , box , football , hockey , track and field athletics and so on .
This is very popular sport and very useful for your health .
You slow run and enjoy the beauty of nature around .
This kind of sport is getting more and more popular over the world .
If you go to Europe you can see a lot of people who go in for jogging .
Speaking about sport I ca n't help saying about football , because this is very spectacular kind of sports .
Some football players are world famous ; they make excellent careers and take part in each championship .
Perhaps , they find ordinary sports too boring and unexciting .
There are different types of extreme sports , for example , rock climbing , rafting , scuba diving , surfing , snowboarding , parachuting , hang - gliding , bungee jumping etc .
However , they become more and more popular even among the beginners .
Doing such sports people learn how to overcome difficult situations and how to survive in an emergency .
In skysurfing you jump out of an airplane and use a board to " surf " the air , doing gymnastics in mid - air !
Winter sports have always an element of danger .
For example snowboarding , which has all the excitement of surfing but on snow , is more dangerous even than skiing .
If you want to feel fit you 'd better go in for one kind of sport or another .
I think that everyone must do all to be healthy .
To tell the truth I do n't do sports regularly and it is not an essential part of my daily life .
In summer I go swimming as there is a beautiful pond with pure water where my Granny lives .
In winter I go in for skating .
If I have free time I go to the nearest skating - rink with my friends and we have much pleasure , skating together .
On the other hand , there are programmes which bring nothing new into our life .
Therefore , one should not waste time watching tem .
Violent programmes , reality shows and others alike have nothing to teach .
In these cases , TV is undoubtedly bad entretainment .
All in all , it is my belief that if we use it properly , i.e. , if we carefully choose what to see , television can have an important role to play in the learning process of everyone of us , and in particular , in the life of the ones who can not afford travelling , buy books or live in an educated environment .
If you are looking for a film that provides you with suspense and action at the same time , I recomend you to watch " Now you see me " .
The film , directed by Louis Leterrier , is about four magicians , known as " The Four Horsemen " that join together by a mysterious benefactor , and during their presentations they do all kind of illegal stuff , such as robbing a bank or ripping off their own boss .
Because of them , there 's an agent of the FBI , Dylan Rhodes , that persecute them through different states of EE.UU .
They are capable of making you think they really know how to illusion someone .
Morgan Freeman is the best actor of all times and perfect for the role of developer tricks and helper of the FBI to catch the " Four Horsemen " .
Also there is no other better for the role of agent as Mark Ruffalo .
But it 's not just the acting that it 's great in the film .
So if you enjoy magic tricks , surprises , very handsome actors and splended actresses , why would you miss it ?
What I did not in Vacations
During vacations I did n't enjoy my time because I did n't find out that I am a wizard .
Sadly , I could n't meet Lady Gaga nor Justin Timberlake .
I was very disappointed because I did not do any of these things during vacations .
I did not go to Hogwarts not turn my brother into a frog .
As aliens did n't kidnap me I did not travel all around the galaxy during this vacations week .
After not being a wizard nor kidnapped by aliens , I did not meet Lady Gaga in New York nor hang out with her and Justin Timberlake .
We three counldn't sing together nor make laugh of Kim Kardashian .
Indeed , what I did in vacations was sleep the whole day , hang out with my " Unfamous " friends and write and compose two and a half songs .
But , lets face it doing these things is not as wonderful as discovering magic powers , being kidnapped by aliens or singins a song with Justin Timberlake and Lady Gaga .
We will be travelling by car to a campsite in Gemany .
Even though it is a large campsite it feels small and cosy .
Some hikes are short , but steep and some hikes are long and involves no climbing at all .
Monica works as the main chef in a restaurant situated in Manhattan , she is Rachel 's best friend since high school and she longs for a boyfriend ( she finally marries Chandler ) .
Rachel has always been daddy 's little girl but , when she brakes her engagement at the beginning of the soap opera , she loses all her money and has to work as a waitress in a cafe ( though she gets a job related to fashion world after a few years ) .
Joey is ... well , he 's Joey : not so clever , a great one for the girls and -the most important- Chandler 's best friend .
The most interesting thing of ' Friends ' , in my opinion , is the love story between Ross and Rachel : the plot starts when Rachel comes to live with Monica in her apartment and Ross falls in love with her .
Living without Internet : Is it possible ?
From 7 am to 7 pm , my computer is running surfing the Internet .
Not only I use it for leisure , but I also use it for work . I would have to change the way I do things on a daily basis .
Will have to start buying magazines and newspapers to be informed ?
My daily routine is based on having access to the Internet : talking to my friends , reading he newspapers , the forecast weather , and so on ... I will have to change my life .
The wrong choice can lead to a big mistake that can influence on our life and people around us .
What if that the boy could be smarter than he himself ?
The only way was to show and prove everyone that he was the best .
So , he decided to ignore him absolutely .
He did n't answer to his questions and did n't want to use all his ideas .
The work was done and Michael was proud because everything was done by himself .
He praised the Michael 's work .
They both left the office soon .
Most people love donating money to different charities , but have you ever thought why it gives us such pleasure ? I believe it 's because , as humans , when we see someone happy , it makes us happy , especially if we are the reason for that happiness .
Is it the poor , homeless children in your country or the starving people in Africa , or is it some cancer organizations ?
When I think about donating money I see sick children and adults with rare diseases , and small groups of scientists and doctors doing their best to help them , but who do n't have enough money for research . I choose them because I know that they are the least people who get help - because how would people help them if they do n't know about them ?
First thing I 'd do if I want to make a donation is go on the internet , and search Google for rare diseases .
Then I 'll look for the diseases which the scientists are currently working on finding their cure .
I 'll be left with a lot to choose from , so I 'll see which illness is the hardest to endure and choose this one to donate my money to .
This makes me realize that even if I have a disease , as hard as it is , I 'm still better than others and I 'm grateful .
To sum up , I believe more people should start donating to the uncommon charity organisations , to the ones who need more help .
It would be sufficient to just see the smile on their face .
We should all be thankful we are what we are , because we could be a lot worse .
According to Berkow ( 2004 ) , Airway management is one component of anaesthesia procedure to ensure the patient airway is opened .
Also , this practice is the primary consideration for an efficient post anaesthesia care ( Scoot , 2012 ) .
The majority of patients that has had a general anaesthetic , as Mr. Sharma , must recover in a PACU ( Post Anaesthesia Care Unit ) to monitor the vital signs , specially the airways management due to the anaesthesia , impeding any postoperative complication ( Scoot , 2012 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 2011 ) .
The first 24 hours of post surgery , is considered the most critical period , because the patient can present , primarily , lung disorders , and the nurse need to maintain the cardio - respiratory stability ( Popov & Peniche , 2009 ) .
Addressing the airway management after Mr. Sharma 's admission on PACU , the first procedure that the nurse should do , is follow the A - G assessment protocol , to review the stability and the airway patency of the patient , sustaining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Mr. Sharma 's airway should be spare and clean from mucus or blood ( Pudner , 2010 ) .
Due to the surgery Mr Sharma is in supine position , but this position reduces his oxygenation ( Snowball , 2012 ) , and also can impede the air passage that is related to the anaesthesia effect , where the tongue and the lower jaw fall backward .
Therefore , the oxygen therapy needs to continue immediately along with his admission , via nasal cannula or oxygen mask within 4 to 6L / min , until the anaesthesia effects are completely gone and the patient 's oxygen saturation be restored ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Thus , Mr. Sharma is been given O2 via Hudson mask 6L / min , because he received general anaesthesia and all of his muscles are relaxed and at the moment he do not have control over his reflexes ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
To help in this issue , the nurse should certificate that Mr. Sharma is confortable , and elevate the head of the bed for a more upright position in order to facilitate and increase his oxygenation , helping him to recover faster his respiratory instability ( Snowball , 2012 ) .
I would like to start saying it is free .
The second advice is you should try to find the best places to walk around you .
The sightseeing is very important once you start walking .
Do not forget to greet me when we met on the road .
All students are different in terms of their cognitive styles , learning levels and achievements as well as motivation , personality , and pace of learning .
While conducting a need analysis , you can have a general picture of learners ' motivation in learning English .
After that , teachers are supposed to use partnership and grouping exercises and activities in order to meet individual 's needs .
Through teamwork , students with varied levels can cooperate and learn from each other through discussions .
It is beneficial for both the upper and lower achiever because they can assist or get help from each other .
Differentiated instructions , giving different tasks for the same activity , are proved to be necessary in a class with varied levels of students .
Teachers can assign tasks which have different levels of difficulty , or different numbers of tasks to students with different levels .
Finally , preparing supplementary for both the upper or lower level of students , so that the higher achievers can stay excited and challenged , while the lower achiever can also learn by their own pace of learning .
Students have more opportunities to learn languages , discover foreign experience , pass internships and study abroad .
Our generation is more developed and diverse in spheres of modern culture , including arts , music , literature etc .
In Ukraine young people are different too .
We can define it by list of TOP music charters on music channels .
It 's necessary to emphasize that Ukrainian music has changed a lot from the time of Independence and now is developed very fast .
It 's interesting to admit that there is fashion on Ukrainian traditional clothes " vishyvanka " now .
I hope after reading of my report you will have some minimal understanding of Ukrainian reality .
Also I encourage you to visit Ukraine and to see its sightseens , to feel culture and speak to nice people !
It 's a small town and there are not too many options of travelling by public transport .
If you want to go to Vigo or other city which is near , the coach service is a good and not too expensive option .
The coaches are slow , so most of the people prefer the car .
If your destiny is further away , another good option is to travel by train .
Train is more expensive , but at the same time , it is more comfortable .
So I think that creating a small bus line between the villages will help a lot of people , especially the older ones .
Dear Mr./Ms .
I have been learning English for 5 years and I hope to take the FCE ( Cambridge exam ) soon . I also write a blog about art on English .
As a member of student club at my college , my responsibility is to organize events and collaborate with many students from different departments .
Working on projects help me improve my organizational and planning skills .
For the beginning , short and animated movies would be the best , such as movie " Validation " that teaches us how words have the power to change our lives .
With my experience and range of skills I am sure I can contribute to your idea and organise great movie nights .
I am happy that you have chosen to spend the following year in my country .
I am sure that you will find in Brazil a perfect fit .
As a country with one of the longest coastline in the world , I definitely would recommend you to know the beautiful beaches we have .
I would also recommend you to know the city of Rio de Janeiro , there you will find beautiful beaches , wonderful weather and the wonders of nature in a modern and international city .
You will be amazed by " Cristo Redentor " and " Corcovado " , I have no words to explain how beauty they are .
Another very good option is exploring Brazil 's Northeast , as beautiful as Rio de Janeiro is .
Most of the biggest American companies are in Brazil for a long time and as an English native speaker it will be easier to you to find and internship .
The nine months that you will spend travelling around Brazil will give you a better understanding of Portuguese and that will be an advantage to you find a new job here .
I have many tips to share with you , I 'll be glad to do it in person when you arrive .
Once again , there is no other better place the world to spend this time you have available .
If you prefer shopping outshide , taking a trip to King Street would be the the thing to do .
If you want typical souvenirs , you can go to the Buckingham Palace , you will find a lot of small shops that sell souvenirs for a reasonnable price .
As you know I enjoyed helping at a concert last week .
It was really exhausting , but illuminating experience .
We tried to make everyone had fun .
There were many visitors from other countries , so we often had to translate the conversation and help in communication .
But the most memorable was a meeting with the stars of the concert .
I could n't be more excited about being for six months in the UK !
I agree with you that I 'm brave , but I think I need this time to relax after all that problems that I had with my grandmother .
I 'm planning to improve my English and I have already registered for a course .
My classes will happen from Monday to Friday , but just in the mornings .
I 'm sure that I will enjoy visiting all that famous castles and churches .
Besides that , I would love travelling to other European countries .
If you ca n't go with me , I think we can go out some nights .
I have a high level of spoken English , as I have been learning it since early chidlhood .
On graduation , I spent two years working as a supplementary education teacher .
My tasks have included organizing sports and other activities for children .
I was also in charge of providing safe and entertaining interection .
Dancing is something that human beings always did , in one way or another .
Since I was a child I wanted to learn how ballerinas could dance so graciously .
On the other hand , I always loved classical music .
Luckily , we got a word of a dancing school .
That , by chance , happen to be near my town .
I spent four years doing one of the things I love the most , dancing .
This is a short story written by D. B. Caulfield , the big brother of Holden Caulfield who is the main character in The Catcher in the Rye from J. D. Salinger .
Some of the selected aspects for this assignment were the characteristics that Holden says he likes in others of his favorite books since this is one of them .
He does not like that his brother is " prostituting himself " by writing scripts for movies since he does not like movies .
I also noticed that one team is not writing anything .
When I approached them , they said they ca n't remember the exact words that were dictated .
Another team used the words to make sentences that are unrelated to the story .
The chairs were placed in a U shape which made it difficult for team members to discuss their ideas and to maintain eye contact .
Ss did n't know how much time they have to finish the task .
Of course , I originally came there to work : putting the chairs and tables right , ensuring that everyone in my appointed space was well - fed , and keeping an eye on the cash counter .
But I realise now that it 's quite late already and that I ought to sleep . I 'll write the rest to you as soon as I can ; I haven't told to the best part yet !
Given the learning experiences in the past two year 's school - based support , some sound teaching strategies have been developed and these include the provision of adequate language inputs , ELPS and Thinking Tools .
All of the above have been taken a good progress in developing P.1 - 4 school - based mathematics curriculum while there is still an area for developing in P.5 & 6 mathematics curriculum .
In view of these favourable conditions , higher expectations could be set to improve the learning progress and enhance the learning performance of NCS .
More collaborative efforts should be paid to make use of the sound teaching strategies with the aim of improving the learning performance of NCS .
Given the experiences gained in the support services , many mathematics teachers have been equipped with necessary skills in identifying the learning needs of students and developing effective strategies for teaching NCS .
The research done in this field has provided new mechanisms that give the impression of being an alternative to yield the necessary amount of crops for humans , unfortunately , there is no evidence of GMC 's being completely safe for human consumption .
It might be a cause of concern that all the research done has been under the command of private corporations that deny full access to experiment reports , leaving a cluster of questions without any answer .
Companies as Monsanto that engineers plants with steeril seeds , encourage non - sustainable production models that promote the extinction of independent farmers who have to choose between their lifestyle and the new farming era .
The Monopolistic and monopsonic features shown in GMC companies establish that the research done in this field has nothing to do either with science or with technology and even less with the global food security .
In their quest for the perfect seed , genetic engineers have strengthened crops that are destroying the seeds biodiversity , as stand by a research led by Greenpeace , GMC crops are threatening to human health because they present more toxic traces than non - modified crops .
It is worth mentioning that we never know the impact that scientific research and harvesting techniques are going to have over our lives , but the fate of those improvements depends on the application that humans give them .
A survey was carried out in the most populated Italian cities and 2000 citizens were interviewed on 22nd October to quantify their interest in such segment of the national TV schedule with the following results :
• 40% of those interviewed , most of which have proven to be young people , declared they watch English - language TV programmes at least five times a week ;
• 30% of them stated they watch them at most twice a week , but they would so more often if they were subtitled ;
Although the importation of such programmes has produced positive effects , such as the introduction of new perspectives on different aspects of life , it has also produced negative outcomes .
I would therefore suggest that local products be protected and valorised , to be able to reply to the threat represented by low price imported ones .
One intelligent person once said : ' The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page . '
I totally agree with this statement and , to my mind , people should travel a lot because our world is incredible .
Even just in cities , let it alone travelling at long distances .
But , on the other hand , traffic jam or bad weather can make our trip inconvenient .
Not all people can afford travelling by car every day so they choose public transport .
Cars pollute our air what leads to many diseases such as asthma , allergy and even cancer .
So , my advice is to travel by bicycle ( at least , use public transport ) because it is environmentally friendly !
The difference in work meetings between the British and France are that the British want to make decisions and the France way more like a debate , as is written in a guide for Franco - British business relationships .
This in contrast to the guide " Light at the End of the Tunnel : Practical Reflections on the French and British in Business " published by the French chamber of commerce in Great Britain .
The by the UK 's Foreign Office in 1944 published booklet " instructions for British Serviceman in France " is still useful for the most , nowadays .
The late actor Louis de Funès is mentioned as a role model by the chamber of commerce 's guide .
When you get hired by a British employer it will be because of your experience or achievements as a leader in sports .
In France the level of education is the main reason for hiring someone .
British does n't speak out what they are thinking , in contrast to the Dutch .
In 1995 the French came to notice that their languish was n't enough for doing business worldwide .
This is one of the reasons why most French under 50 does n't speak English very well .
International relationships are built by people who can speak the same languish and who are at the same level of their vocabulary .
The native speakers seek each other out , the British come together with the Americans and the French well … they are on their own .
If the French and British spoke the same languish evenly , the trade would go up by 44 per cent .
It 's no use to teach French on schools , because the French only except near native speakers .
It 's better to talk British and force it on them .
I live in a small town called Grycksbo and I 've been part of Unga Kris volunteering programs since the summer 2010 .
Now that I have been volunteering for a while , my expectations have changed : Unga KRIS is still a place where I expect to have fun and meet new people but I also expect to grow even more as a person , to take on responsibilities and face my fears in different social situation . »
In many cases , volunteers are crucial to help maintain life , as when meals are delivered to homebound people .
It 's something that makes part of our grow to adulthood .
When I was nineteen , I started and ran my own business , for me , was one of the most exciting choices that I made .
Of course , without the full support of my family I could n't have done it .
At first , I found it as an exhilarating and rewarding challenge , although it was a modest shop .
But it was n't enough , the fact of the matter was that I ignored that being self- employed entailed self - sacrifice , devoting my time , energies and a great deal of patience with the customers , it was so hard!.
Things gradually improved day by day for a time and my reneues stated growing .
So I did n't mind working against time and long hours .
During the next ten years , I was thrilled about the fact to put aside in order to build our flat step by step .
When I got married , things quickly went from bad to worse because I had to work at two shifts , at home and the shop .
As a matter of fact Budapest , the capital city of Hungary can be a very good competitor for hosting this sporting event .
Buda castle is an impressive ancient picturesque building and attractive tourist location .
The obsolete trams and trolleys had been replaced .
Bicycle trails can criss - cross the city .
2 . ) Airport Hotel is the most adjacent accommodation to the Liszt Ferenc airport .
The admission 's tickets to the most of Budapest 's museums are comparatively cheap .
The main concern is related to petty crime , especially the pickpocketing .
In addition , the homeless people have to sleep in the street .
The government should renovate the buildings which would be a great shelter for homeless people .
The police chief should reinforce their patrol officers to tackle the crime .
In conclusion it would be a good idea and a viable way through sponsorships .
Moreover , this would be advantageous both for hosting city and the tourists .
I had just graduated the Academy and was on my summer holidays .
By that time I had visited six interviews , but nobody was interested in my candidacy .
I decided to go to my parents and spend a few weeks helping them with a renovation of their house .
At first I did not understand anything and I had decided that it was a mistake .
But then I remembered when I was 15 I 've sent my scientific work to the Patent service .
It turned out that they send my work to a few Instituts and one of them was interested in me .
That day was a start of my scientific career .
In 50 years ' time , maybe not all of the natural resources will have been used up , but most of it then will have been exploited .
I 'm completely sure that 50 years from now we will still be living on Earth , although our life styles will have changed a lot .
So , is it really worth it getting away from it all and setting off on a journey around the world or taking their first job ?
Moreover , they feel they have to make the most of their time to become a university graduate and get a life in what they really love .
Therefore , they choose a job that is related to a hobby or sport so that they can learn from and earn money at the same time .
To my mind , gaining experience of any kind and taking a year gap before plunging into applying for a university course will broaden young people 's perspective to life and will help them become more confident with what they really love .
Luckily enough , they may end up working in another country or their hobby could become their career .
I learned somewhere that the best thing to make a path through your writing is to start tipping .
I 'm not sure if this is true or wrong , because simply I 'm not here to judge or comment on the authenticity of the statement , but rather , I 'm here to make my path through writing .
How can one know they got the talent ?
How can one know they have the guts ? what I believe , and think it 's true , is that braveness , boldness as well as callousness make people write truly what they think , without any lies , without any camouflage and without any kind of burnished layers .
Writers often make their masterpieces shiny and glowing in order to make it more acceptable by people , less shocking to them and less close to the reality from which readers had the intention to escape when they have picked that piece of writing in the first place .
Thus , bad natural personality can be the seed of crime .
On the other hand , I would argue that poverty can be the major catalyst for illegality .
It means that a number of law offenders can not sustain their livelihood , and they desperately experience limited options to earn money .
As a result , they are easily drawn by the allure of wealth , which leads to illegal activities such as theft , kidnapping or drug trafficking .
Big cities such as Hanoi or New Delhi witness a growth in juvenile delinquency which mostly stems from rural and underdeveloped areas .
In addition , the prevalence of social media such as television or the internet is partially to blame .
This is particularly common among young people who are unable to differentiate between fiction and reality .
In conclusion , although human nature is likely to be a cause of crime , I hold the position that crime occur due to social media and poverty .
In the past people used technology as a tool for making survival an easier endeavor .
Nowadays we are witnessing a shift in the role technology is playing in our society and may continue to play for generations to come .
In the modern - day world technology is no longer a tool for survival but it turned to a means of communication and entertainment .
At the same time this raises the concern of whether technology has a good or bad influence on our society , is the use of technology destroying face - to - face interaction and communication between people ?
Whenever you 're in a coffee shop , standing at a bus stop or taking the tube you can easily see how people are connected to each other using different sorts of electronic devices .
The primary concern regarding this new communication behavior is whether it made face - to - face interaction and communication between people nonexistent .
This is true in many aspects as this may lead to living in a virtual world that only includes interacting with people with texting and social networks .
This leads , among other things , to the ability for people to be lonely , as having too many virtual friendships causes the inability to establish meaningful relationships .
The young generations in our society are participating in a massive , unintentional social experiment the results of which are not entirely predictable .
Nowadays , society tends to prejudge others just because of their actions and without knowing the real motive of the behaviour .
But with Colton 's quotation , we can clearly see that it has happened since years .
In our current society we can see it daily .
Lot of children got their hair cut as their favourite football players , others dress like their favourite actors and actresses or even adults act as their role model , just because they all do have something in common : they admire those people .
Flattering is different , it is easier to recognize .
Nowadays , in some determinate cases , people when they pretend to get a good position or be promoted , they flatter .
When acceding to these jobs is not through civil service exams , I think there are only two ways : influences or flattery ; and to be honest I do n't know what I prefer .
To sum up , I would like to invite people who agree with the quotation , to rethink their opinion because everything is not what it seems to be .
But there are some lines ... that are way too dangerous to cross .
If you 're willing to take the chance ... the view from the other side is spectacular .
A way that no one ever seems to tells you about .
I am really interested in martial arts , such as Aikido , Judo and self - defense that I have already practiced .
There are some that do not need too much forces and strengths , such as Thai chi and others that need more like Karate , Judo , and so .
the First advantage of martial arts is to improve self - confidence .
You will get ready to fight with others , regardless their strengths , ages and so on .
When you do a technique successfully on your opponent , you feel more confidence .
Second advantage of doing martial arts is how to respect others .
Every time , you do a technique you have to show your respect to opponent , and also other ranks , regardless to their age .
Third one is movement and coordination between different parts of body ; eyes , hands and legs .
When you do a technique or defense against a technique , you control your body 's movement and coordinate them to work in the same time .
Some people think there are some disadvantages like injury , and getting aggressive .
People who practise martial arts are less aggressive because they practice to control their inner energy , and also to respect .
I suggest that everyone should try martial sports .
But before starting , you supposed to evaluate your needs and your health condition .
The original work was written by the mathematical , logical and British writer Lewis Carroll .
The wonderland that is described in the book is created through logic games , and , therefore , it is understandable the success it has achieved in the most varied environments .
The exceptional play that we saw yesterday features all the iconic characters adapted to some extent adapted to the present time , such as , the White Rabbit , Mad Hatter , the blue caterpillar or the Queen of Hearts .
One of the biggest differences with the book is the atmosphere created on stage and the characterization of the characters .
The only negative comment I could make is that you do not have the possibility to let your imagination in the same way that when you read the book .
However , I strongly recommend going to see this play because it has a great appeal to both adults and children .
" Encourage learner autonomy - the teacher wo n't always be there to provide answers " Alternatives to whole class feedback onestopenglish .
This lesson was the third trail of giving students written instructions and having them explain to the classmates what activities need to be done .
This time in order to further reduce my TTT I handed over the correction of activities to the students as well .
I hope by handing over the complete control to the class this would give them more chance to practice real world discussion and negation . techniques
The amount of talking done by the students was more that pleasing .
They enjoyed being the"boss " and giving telling other students what to do .
I had an exact copy of what the students had on their clue cards on a separate piece of paper this time rather than in the lesson plan its self .
This made every thing seem less cluttered and more manageable .
I highlighted anything that required an action from me on my copy of the clues e.g. handing a student the answers to an exercise .
Giving the students the answers the exercises was a partially efficient way to encourage the students to speak more .
This is the first time I have tired this method and I neglected to leave the students extra time to be able to benefit fully from the exercise .
The enjoyed the exercise so much that my timing was completely off .
In heinz sight giving this much control to the class and introducing a new and tricky grammar point ( past modals ) was not the best choice .
The next time I do this lesson I would use a more skills based lesson with perhaps a listening or a short reading .
If grammar was part of the lesson It would need to be a point that is being revised .
Despite having timing issues , I feel that thus far this was the class with the most natural student participation and the lowest amount of TTT .
I throughly enjoyed the lesson and according to student feedback , so did they .
It 's a city where you can recreate a part of the European history , thanks to the ancient and magnificent building , and where you can enjoy the last technologies and have fun .
I suggest visitin the Vatican , as I said at the beginning ; the county inside the city .
Inside it , we can find the well known sistine chapel , I ca n't tell you how it is , because last year when I went , there was a changeover of pope , and it was closed and I could n't entry .
On the other hand , there are more places to visit , as the Coliseum or something else .
Whatever happens , I 'm sure , you 'll enjoy the city .
Furthermore , if you go in summer , you should go to a lively area and be with the interesting and nice people , but like every city , be careful with the rough areas .
Despite the people 's opinions , if you have the opportunity to go , do n't throw it away , and check it for yourself .
As the majority of you I have friends who are still around me since many years ago although we do n't see each other regularly , others simply have softly become less important and some luckily have recently entered my life .
With any doubt a good friend is a treasure .
Counting on someone capable of understanding your demands , who shares with you the innermost feelings and who is able of discussing possible misunderstandings , is totally rewarding .
As the saying goes " A friend in need is a friend indeed " .
If you respect your friends then they will respect you .
In other words , no matter how far you live , a good friend will always support to you .
Curiously , you never know where will you find a friend and every stage of your life brings you the opportunity to take advantage of new people who maybe attends to the same sport lessons than you or simply work in the same company .
It is surprising the amount of nice people next to you sometimes , and it is a question of spending some time to realize that you have now new friends .
As I said before every moment in your life is different as your friends probably are too .
Hi!How are you ? Have you found your car keys ?
Or has it ran away ?
I wanted to write to you earlier , but we had my sisters ' birthday party and I had an allergic reaction from something I 've never eaten before .
At first we did n't know what was it from , then I realized that the cake had blue berries , and I 've never eaten one before .
After we ate the cake , I found my mom looking at me an screaming:"Oh !
I did n't know was happening , and why they were acting like this .
Suddenly I felt my whole body itching me , mom took me upstairs .
When I looked at the mirror , my face was spotted with red spots and it kind of turned purple , when I looked at my hands and my arms , it was all red from my fingers when I was scratching them , and the parts that were n't red , they were spotted like my face .
Anyways , mom gave me a medicine(I do n't know what it is ) , and a cream for my arms and hands because they were turning blue .
And do n't be afraid , I 'm okay , and I decided to check on everything from blue berries .
How is the experience of learning another language ?
The learning of our mother tongue language is a long term process that everyone has to be involved in .
However , who is skilled in speaking a foreign language has a huge advantage in a competitive and worldwide society .
On the one hand , I have been learning English for so long that my good profeciency have given me the chance to get a position in an international work team .
On the other hand , I have learned French and Spanish just for a few months , because I was curious to learn the oficial language of the countries , where friends and relatives are living in .
I am only able to read simple worksheets and to make a brief presentation about me .
As a student of these classes , especially , of English ; I realized that , although the classes were important , a systematic language practice was essential for reaching an advanced level and , moreover , for maintaining it .
Nevertheless , learning another language has many benefits , such as the ability in living and visiting countries with different languages , meeting foreign people , working in an international environment , reading books or websites in other languages , etc .
Bauer 's fourth novel is an originally surprising thriller which includes an astonishing view of Aspergen syndrome from the prospective of Patrick , a trainee medicine student .
With the tender age of 18 and coping with his eccentric social code and all the possible courage , Patrick moves from his mother 's house to a rented flat in Cardiff to pursue his greatest dream , work in the Anatomy Department at Cardiff University .
The writer lets us observe the fear , anxiety and the defenceslessness of Sam , a neurological patient who is just beginning to emerge from its comatose state and has yet to deal with the reality of his new situation , sorting out pieces of memories involving relatives and not quite understanding why a woman he does n't know anything about claims to be his wife .
Patrick performances brilliantly the autopsy of Sam and finds out shocking information which leads the reader to the discovery of tragic and incidental deaths of neurological patients involving all at once doctors , nurses and patient 's relatives .
In this task , Patrick will be helped out by Lexi , the daughter of his autopsy corpse , to throw some light out of the creepy suspicion of medical mistreatment and their darkest consequences .
Everything started with some attacks here and there but no one really knew what was happening , so the attacks were tagged as " animal attacks " .
But when they became more frequent and witnesses described huge , flurry , dark and terrifying creatures with blood - shot eyes , panic grew over the population .
Government authorities told people to stay calm and a curfew was established , but Peter was on the camping holiday with his best friends and only heard this when they met another group of people that , fortunately , had a radio .
In order to be stronger in number , they befriended those people and helped each other .
The new group worked very well together but there was this girl he just could n't stand at all .
" It 's the end of the world , and I have to spend it with you ? " he whispered , the night had already fallen and they did n't want any unwanted visitors .
I 'm 23 years old and love to cook and I also love to be outdoors and play sports with the kids , I love organizing activities for children and actually playing with them , I 'm always cheerful and in a great mood , I do n't smoke or Drink , I have a good level of english speaking and I 've always been hardworking and energetic
I 'm also very good with first aid , so if someone is hurt I 'm very helpful with that too , I can do pretty much anything that you want me to , I love all kids and I love spending time with them , I love playing outside and caring for all the children .
overall I just love children
Dear Paul , you are right , it is really a brave step but you know how much is terrible the situation in Italy and I have decide to come to the UK to improve my cv as well .
At the moment I am struggling with the translation of my cv .
I am wondering if you could help me by giving me some tips to write a perfect cv , or at least acceptable .
I have just found a cheap accommodation in a hostel which is very convenient to all the facilities .
Even though I am shy and I like my privacy , I think that during this experience it will be better to have contacts with foreign people to practise my spoken English as much as possible .
Now let 's talk about the good things .
The aim of this experience is also having fun and great time with you .
For example , what about going for some walks across the countryside or renting a bike ?
I know that the country is really lovely there .
Ok , I have told you everything and I really should finish packing !
I am rather lazy as a person , I ca n't say I really enjoy sports in general but I definitely love walking .
I think it 's so effective : having a long walk on the green hills that surround my town , breathing deeply , enjoying the perfume of nature and the wonderful sights and colours of flowers and trees , it 's the best for me to clear my mind .
There 's no special advice to give to somebody who wants to start this activity : if you aim doing something good for your health and for your mind , just wear comfortable clothes , put your pair of trainers on , choose the most inspiring place and just go and enjoy any minute of it .
I would recommend 30 min per day , to get the most of this activity : it does n't take too much of your spare time and you 'll get great benefits from it .
It 's very cheap as well : except for your jumpsuit and a pair of comfortable trainers , it does n't require any extra cost for technical or sophisticated equipment .
I think this is a very good experience to you because you can learn about another culture and people 's way of thinking .
So , I suggest you try to get a working holiday visa of Korea .
As you know , if you have normal tourism visa , you ca n't work .
In Korea , we have many kinds of work which is related to English , so you can get a job easliy .
Also , if you want to work more specific place such as electric company , public office and so on , you can apply to internship programme .
If you get the intership , you can work as a real businessman .
In summer , you can enjoy many activities on the beach and also you can go hiking .
Especially , I strongly recommend you go to Jeju Island .
It is the most popular place that people want to go .
If you want to know more information about Korea , let me know and I do n't mind checking your plan to go Korea .
It was a winter night .
Not only was it going to change my life , but also other person 's life .
When we arrived at the police office , I met an officer called Michael .
Nevertheless , the police had found out the buried body .
Michael asked me where I had been at the time of the crime and I answered him that I had been at home having a rest with a friend who could bear out the alibi .
While the interview , I realised the different ways I would use to get away if I were alone .
Fortunately , Michael , who had n't thought that option , left the interrogation room .
With over two hundred thousand dollars in his bag he was a giant walking target .
Ragged and worn , it certain had seen better days .
Travelling farther down he found his destination , a small steep staircase covered in dust and shrouded in a mist like fog .
A police officers car was zooming in his direction , sirens blaring .
To begin with , I think that most people use their car to go to work and also when they go on holiday o to move themselves around the city or town because they feel free and do n't have to pay attention to the timetable .
But , on the other hand , when they travel abroad , it 's easier to take a train o a plane because you arrive faster and you need n't find a place to park your car and if you want to go somewhere you can take a taxi or a bus or even the underground .
Anyway , I do n't think public transport has no future , but public transport is used on different occasions from before and when you go to a place you know you wo n't be able to find a place to park and you ca n't waste time looking for where to park .
To make bank notes , the first step is to properly design it .
While background color and art work are thoroughly considered , security issues are one thing that we can not over look either .
After this , metal plates need to be prepared by skilled machinists so as to proceed to bank notes printing , in which stage sheets are used to print ( each containing 50 bank notes ) .
Also , special ink is printed on both side of the sheet and the images are slightly raised .
Sheets in the second groups then get seperated into good ones , which , together with good quality sheets , enter a process of packaging and distribution where seperate notes are cut and finally enter the market , and bad ones , which go to disposal with bad quality sheets , where both groups get securely destroyed .
This leads us to a conclusion that the process of bank notes creation is secure as well as simple .
My boyfriend is the best in all the entire round world .
I met him two years ago in a party , and since that day my life has changed in many different ways .
When I first saw him I never imagined that I would love that stranger this way .
I have many memories with him , which I always keep on my heart even if they are god or bad .
One of them was the day we went to a concert of our favourite DJ , we had so much fun , we danced , kissed and sang like never before that night .
I love it .
Now on days , we are still together , and we are as happy as in our beginning .
As a secret I can tell you that I want to marry him so badly , I swear to god that my life would be much better if I can live all of it with him .
" It 's time for us to shine , " His handwritten words come to life in her mind .
She could distinctively hear his low , manly voice in her head .
His deep chuckles still made butterflies in her stomach .
Every movement seem to take a minute to execute .
The person was holding her wrist , preventing her from wiping any sweat on her face .
Wide eyed , red lips , rosy cheeks , broad - build and a little stubble on his chin , he looked incredible .
This blue eyes , were much darker with insecurity , doubt and mystery .
Her eyes gazed to his lips .
He must have applied some lip stick for it to be that red !
She knows , she knows and she knows it is so wrong to put all happiness , dreams and hopes on someone that may leave anytime but she could not help it .
First of all , let me tell the adavantages .
Next we could ask for help to our community . I have some books in my library I could donate .
I have them because I have paid for them , not for other particular reason .
In conclusion , we should provide free books to our students .

My CV , which is enclosed , contains additional information on my experience and skills .
The streets were calmed and the lights were pleasant . Travelling at night was a pleasure in this town .
" So here we are " he said looking upward . "
We better do our exam as soon as we can "
They moved in the crowd that made several phone calls and talked about their busy life .
She looked around making faces at everyone around .
" You have to do your duty here too , remember ? We made a progress back in the other city "
She nooded and made another effort to look around .
Who could be ?
As usual , they were talking about illegal things
They came closer to the man .
The other person was n't convinced howewer .
They talked for hours one trying to convince the other , he was doing his best , but at the end , the other man declined .
When he finished talking he looked to the young couple in front of him
" What are you doing here pests ? !
" He made sure his voice was heard on the streets , to reafirm his social position .
The young couple grinned " You haven't heard about the mind hackers right ? "
He gasped and tried to scream but it was too late to run .
She looked on her laptop , where all the information in that man 's mind was displayed
" Bingo . We got a code "
She inspected the man looking for an Id. She took it and as soon as they got it , they let the man go , who fainted and will not remember anything that happened to his mind .
The thief couple made their way to the main building .
They entered the building with the aid of the ID and made use of the code to enter the interiors of the building .
They got with the receptionist
" Are you two the people who will make their skill test ? "
The couple nooded and showed the ID of the man from the other city .
The receptionist nooded and conducted both to the main hall .
It was disturbing as kids were also included .
One of the bosses in charge of such thing .
She felt somehow nervous " I know we are doing this to escape this inferno but ... I have a bad feeling about this " but it was too late .
They walked in to find a man looking through the window
" You two are finally here . I know who you are "
It was impossible they deleted every bit of information about themselves
" Did you think you two were going to make fun of me? ... "He pushed her backwards
" Welcome to your tombstone , hackers "
Just how a coin has two sides , television too , has its pros and cons .
Off late , debates in news channels are the talk of the town where u get to know what is happening in your country or neighborhood .
Such programs also allows us to participate by giving our feedback .
Gone are the days when tom mindlessly chased jerry .
presently we have many educational cartoons that teach kids how to draw , make crafts and even learn languages .
Home of the future will look more or less the same as the home of the present .
Even today processors are in almost every device : dishwashers , vacuum cleaners , television sets , even blenders .
It may sound silly , but I think it actually will make those devices more user friendly and functional .
Even now we can buy TV sets with Internet connection , so development of technology is not a problem .
But we have to ask ourselves why would we connect every device in our house to World Wide Web ?
Imagine you can programme your house to welcome you after a long day at work .
You come back and dinner is cooked , all your favourite programmes are recorded and ready to watch , Your bath is full of hot water and you can just relax .
Reassuming , while design of houses may look different the most important change will be in technology which will make our life easier .
It has already done but we still ca n't see the end of possibilities .
Firstly I would like to say that I have some experience in looking after children because I have worked at a local summer camp last summer .
As for my personality , I would like to mention that I am a funny person who enjoys telling jokes , making people laugh and even getting dressed as a clown to entertain others .
If you require any further information , I am available for an on line interview .
It 's no secret that there has been a decline in the use of transport such as taxis ever since cars became more affordable and your common Joe became capable of sustaining one , two or more per family , however , does that really mean that the future of public transport like buses is hopeless ?
Many affordable bus and metropolitan passes and other systems have also been created in order to motivate the citizens to use them , providing a quicker , and sometimes cheaper , alternative to their own transport .
Nothing was taking his attention .
It was n't only the smile , but the way she talked to him , the look in her eyes and her flirty attitude what had filled his stomach with tiny butterflies and , as he was going home , he started to realize the love running through his veins , right to the heart .
He picked up the keys from his pocket and approached carefully , holding his breath .
If you are a fan of romantic films , you probably do n't like this movie . " Palmeras en la nieve " is a Spanish film based on a book written by Luz Gabas which is about the life of a Spanish man who goes to Bioko to work and he falls in love with a native woman .
The problem with this movie is not the story because the book is fantastic and when you read it , you really can feel the emotions to the characters .
Furthermore , the main actors ' performance is not very good because they are not completely inside in their roles .
An example of that it 's the extremely amazing soundtrack with a really beautiful song of Pablo Alboran , a Spanish singer .
Other good features are the customs and the landscapes which give to the movie a very realistic image and carry the spectators to that time
It 's been a long time since we last contact each other .
It 's an activity that you need to do every day , now that it 's a good way to keep fit .
The majority of people think of sport as a way to relax , to get thin or to keep fit .
It is in these moments where I give it my all , and realize that all the pratice I had really paid off .
This is why I suggest people to give swimming a try .
I believe you should be fully informed about the quality of the services in the advertisements you publish , as your readers could be negatively biassed towards your paper only due to such incidents .
Generally , the holiday as a whole was good enough as the most important -in my opinion- aspects , like the quality of the guided tours and the accommodation , was very high .
The fist day was a great shock to me as I realized I would be part of a group .
Spending holidays with a group can be very convenient and for some people is the only way of travelling , but the advertisement did not state clearly that it concerned this particular type of holiday , which made me and some others feel deceived .
Much time lost could have been saved with a few phone calls , for example waiting for half an hour in a queue could have been prevented if a call had been made to the museum before we arrived there .
There are six main characters Ross , Monica , Rachel , Chandler , Phoebe and Joey .
On the other hand Joey and Chandler live together .
Joey is an actor and he is always making auditions without success .
And Chandler works in an office but he does n't really like his job .
Phoebe is the funniest of the group , she sings and plays the guitar but she is not very good at it .
Rachel and Monica have lived together since Rachel left her fiance on the altar .
She works in a restaurant as the head chef and she 's dating with a man twenty years older than her .
The six friends might not have the same opinion , they might argue , they might get angry with each other but they always forgive and forget !
In my opinion young people will love this show .
To sum up I really recommend you to see it , you 'll love it
I really recommend this movie , but if you plan watching it with your family , I do have to tell you that there is a lot of blood and killing in the film .
I can easily give it a five star rate because all of the events that happen seem real in the movie , and they are events that can happen in real life .
With no doubt all parents want their children to be citizen models .
However raising a child into a model citizen is extremely hard - working .
On one hand , parents should take responsibility on their children education as they are a child 's first contact .
Also , parents are like models to follow for their children , and as children do what they see they will copy their parents actions .
Indeed school is the first place where a children interacts with society .
Ultimately , teachers may have different values from the ones of the parents .
On the other hand , parents may have lack of time to spend with their children due to demanding jobs and to provide everything that their children need , for example pay for their children school .
It can also be argued that children spend most of their time at school and not at home , making the school responsibility to pass good social values .
To sum up , parents should take full responsibility for their children education .
However , one should take into account that a school with similar values to the ones of the parents would be a great help in the children raising process .
I am writing in regard to the advertisement published by you , to work in summer camps in the USA .
I would like to take part in this experience during the summer , as I will have my summer brake during that period .
I have taken part in a volunteer programme , looking after children 6 - 12 during the school term , and therefore I consider myself as having a good knowledge of children 's behaviour , that might be useful for the summer camp .
I am a cheerful , energetic and hardworking person , and I am also a very responsible person , able to deal with small and medium groups of children , and for this reason I consider myself as suitable for the potition advertised .
I am looking forward to taking part in this project , and enrich my personal curriculum through the participation in this project .
Looking forward to hearing from you , at your earliest convenience .
Restpectfully ,
Everything in this movie , Henri , is so simple and startling , but in the same time is hard to describe .
As time passes by , the relationship has so many ups and downs , but with consistent love and caring it ends with a strong bond that is n't easily broken .
In France , where the film is made , they call the handicapped , " White Butterflies " , which is definitely a better nomenclature than " People With Special Needs " and so many dishonored names .
The only reason I want to recommend this movie to you is because I want you to forget about all the action , thrilling , money making or good fighting evil .
My sole purpose is to help you enjoy the little things in your lives , appreciate the life and its simplicity with all its hidden fun and sad parts as well .
Unlock the door toward a new life and kick off your journey toward a whole new group of characters .
chase the childish dream of visiting a foreign country and get to know new aspects of life .
Check out how ordinary people , just like you and me , live each and every day , share their grief and problems , join them with their happy moments , get involved in their lives and be passionate and compassionate .
The aim of this report is to briefly describe the main strengths and weaknesses of the course " Good design using DTP " so as to give an overall view of it .
The course took place in the Training center in Regent Street - London on the 14 - 15 of May , as scheduled .
All the participants , which were ten in total , were given a personal computer for the duration of the entire course in order to put into practice what was taught .
The tutor , Will Reeves - a lecturer of the University of Cambridge , succeeded in covering the whole program in an extremely effective way .
To begin with , he focused on design considerations with DPT , explaining what software to use , and then he went on to tell us about typography and fonts , layout and balance as well as graphics and logs .
Therefore , he concluded the course by making color considerations and showing proofing and printing .
The highpoint , however , was the final practical exercises which gave us the opportunity to test our comprehension .
Not only was the venue inconvenient but it was also dirty .
The general dissatisfaction was perceived by the lecturer too , who pointed it out to the organizers who immediately started looking for an alternative venue .
In addition , in spite of having paid a lot , the participants were not allowed to take any materials away , and this resulted in obtaining a less effective result as the participants did n't have any materials to use to revise .
In conclusion , we would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in this subject for both the quality of the course and the unquestionable preparation of the tutor .
Nowadays , many countries have been ruined areas of farmland , forest and wetland with the intention to construct housing and transport networks to cater to the demand of people .
There are many problems created by doing large - building projects , and it is the government 's responsibility to cope with these problems .
There are some unfavorable influence on people 's lives .
Because of the damage of farmland , forest and wetland , it is likely to lead to the pollution of water and air , which can cause the decrease of people 's living quality .
For example , in some areas , people have to wear a musk while having outdoor activities and they might need to purchase water from other towns .
As a result , their lifestyle can be negatively affect and thus they would feel less happy than other people lived in unpolluted areas .
The damage of habitats have affect animals in negative way .
They have to immigrate to another place since their homes are destroyed , and during the immigration most of them would die because of lack of water , high temperature or predators .
Besides , those animals who successfully arrive at proper place to live are likely to suffer from disease , because they did n't exposed to such a new environment before .
Although there are many people and animals are suffer from these problems , i do believe that the government can take some actions to solve them .
Firstly , laws should be set to forbid some projects which cause massive problems to the environment .
Secondly , it is necessary for the government to warn people the serious problems caused by constructing large - scale buildings .
To summarise , large - scale building projects create massive problems which are harmful to human and animals , but the government can be helpful in solving these problems
First of all , at the English course which I do at the HZ , I learned and improved my writing in many ways .
I would like to answer some questions from the guideline on Moodle , to explain how this course helped me to improve my English .
And the other questions : Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process ?
From my point of view , my writing definitely has improved from the beginning of this school year till now .
Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process ?
More words can be add in the article , so there can be a better explanation of the subject .
I learned a lot of new words during the presentations , which I used in my free writing .
To finish , I can conclude that this English course has been very useful to me , because it has improved my English very well .
The way I see it is that the grammatical features learned in English course , always can be used later on in life .
For example , when there have to be sent letters in English .
This is because all the people dream for a better future .
Among them a private means of transportation suggests that there is no future for public transport .
It is already in practice in western world .
Having own car or means of transportation is the dream of every individual including me .
Private care per individual is needed .
Whether to go to work or other places travelling in private vehicle is hassle free .
It saves lot of our time .
The trend of personal car is increasing rapidly .
We can not deny that there will be time when no person would like to travel by bus or train .
It is so much clear that private transport will overshadow the public vehicles .
Everybody knows about the big problem that our society has , in terms of domestic abuse .
But most of us just from far ; we really do not imagine how this can affect people who suffer it .
Unfortunately , many people are damaged , not only physical but mentally and the worst is that violence destroys families and also involves their sons in the hell it causes .
Children quite often feel guilty of can not avoid these troubles or help their mothers to escape from them and tend to think they are doing something wrong when they obviously do not .
It is very serious and hard to solve because victims have to be very strong and brave to recognize and face these situations and being able to report their aggressor so as to manage the matter finishes .
Even , in most cases , they feel ashamed or afraid of these situations and prefer saying nothing to tell their truth .
All those people who are living this abuse have to know that they are really important and deserve to be happy and free and they are not alone .
There are many people who worry about and are willing to help and support them .
There is always someone who you can count on in your family , friends or associations , but you must ask for help .
There are many reasons for using public transport , such as commuting in to the central business district .
However , the public transport use can be affected by a number of factors such as mechanical failures and environmental issues .
Using the car can be more flexible for some individuals .
I think there is a role for both methods of transport after taking in to account all of the above reasons .
The reasons for use is dependent on the individual and the circumstances .
It 's one of the best Al Pacino 's films and it 's very different from previous ones .
First of all , in this film you do n't see a gangster Al Pacino , it 's about a retired army 's coonel who suffers from loneliness and depression .
It 's worth seeing because a young boy , Charlie , helps him get through his sadness in a very luxurious trip to New York .
However , the drama is perfectly achieved in each scene and they keep you tied to the screen .
So , overall I strongly recommend it if you like redemption stories , and if you want to learn some pieces of advice for your life .
The reading discusses the idea of how advance communication technologies give us an advantages of creating a 24/7 international working day and provides several reasons of support .
First point the professor addresses involves the reading 's assertion that creating two or three teams situated in different geographical locations will help reduce the work hours for each team and at the same time it will decrease the time frame of getting the project done .
The professor refutes this point of view by saying that based on his own experience this team work could be not so much beneficial .
For instance , some group could have questions , but it would not be able to ask the other group because they would sleep at that time .
Therefore , the working group will do its assumptions and may cause a waste of time .
Moreover , the group in California may do work in one way and a group in India do same work differently , so it will be challenging to bring both of them to the same way of getting things done .
Another point from the article that the professor opposes is the claim that telecommunication helps to solve many problems that physical separation would cause to businesses .
The professor points out that holding virtual meetings between teams in different time frames will be challenging .
Thus , one of the team will have to stay late in order to talk to another group causing inconvenience .
These variables include internal and external cultural expects .
This variables influence the behavior of employees .
The model distinguishes three kinds of expected performances : individual- , groups- , and organizational performances .
The researchers found that there is a big difference between what the boardroom preach and what the employee 's experience .
More and more people nowadays try to find some ways of relaxation , due to a fast pace of life and stress .
Smoking appeals to hearts of many people of different generations , because it gives a fast relief for a short period of time , that is also quite reasonable .
It 's a fact that tobacco is used as a light drug for centuries by people of different nationalities .
Moreover tobacco contains a vitamin , called PP1 that is beneficial for your health .
It also helps to overcome some stressful situations , even though it 's temporarily , it 's still beneficial for your heart , rather than being constantly stressed .
Finally smoking is personal choice of freedom for everyone .
On the other hand , smokers sometimes even do n't realize that their children or relatives become passive smokers too .
So if your habits can be harmful for them you need to understand what 's a cost of it .
For the same reason government needs to control the situation , by using banning strategy if people smoke in one of forbidden ares , like kindergartens , schools , hospitals , etc .
In my opinion , people need to have freedom to make decisions on their own , but as soon as it starts to be a treat for others , they should be stopped immediately .
Madrid is a huge city which offers a lot of recycling facilities that take care of the environment :
There is a great public transport syste .
Old clothes , books and toys in good conditions can be passed on to charity shops .
It could be an example for other cities on how to help and conserve our planet .
Over the past few decades , human activities have changed global climate , hence we are facing higher risks of weather - related disasters .
Furthermore , various destructive disasters have struck into the whole society with many negative elements , drawing the attention of citizens toward catastrophes .
Natural disasters such as drought can be generally defined as one that has a far - reaching influence because its long duration and wide scope .
One of the overt reasons for weather - related natural disasters is global warming .
Moreover , the world 's uncontrollable population results in the demand of cars , industries and farming industries , that have contributed to greenhouse gases .
With the cause of human activities , the temperature of sea surface and the atmosphere have been gradually growing to a new level .
van Aalst ( 2006 ) pointed out that an increase of earth mean surface temperature with approximately 0.6 degrees has been explored over the past century , with the phenomenon which has been observed that land temperature has exceeded that of seas by a quicker speed ( p.6 ) .
In addition , most of greenhouse gas emissions can affect the atmosphere for decades , which might cause marine monsoon inaccessibility to mainland resulting in low rainfall .
Another phenomenon can be caused by global warming is the decrease of snow coverage in relation to glaciers melting ( van Aalst , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
Thus , it can be seen that global warming has accounted for a series of extreme weather phenomenon .
Generally , the increase of temperature has resulted in a surge of hot days , and a drop of cold days .
This will largely causes less of soil water and precipitation .
The area as mid - continental will unquestionably become dryer and insufficient precipitation , which is possible to make it more vulnerable to summer droughts ( van Aalst , 2006 , p.8 ) . "
In brief , there will be serious consequences in terms of less precipitation due to extreme weather .
The direct impact of prolonged drought is the reduction of incomes for farmers result from the decrease of output .
This can lead to the loss of profits from upstream and downstream throughout the supply chain , which can produce directly negative impacts for producers , as reported by Bauman , Goemans , Pritchett and McFadden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .
Moreover , it creates a colossal economic damage when the drought occurs : lives are lost , people and animals are forced to move to a new place , resources become unsustainable or even extinct ( Bergholt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .
Another stricken area is social perspective , which has threatened the majority of the population .
Firstly , drought has caused farming in some of the area , such as Africa where is an underdeveloped of infrastructure and a lack of abilities to react after emergency .
Moreover , farming is one of the most crucial impacts of weather - related natural disasters , and it has caused an important number of casualties for both mankind as well as animals .
Secondly , farming also has contributed to migration .
When public suffers from natural disasters and they are no solutions , they are forced to leave their home in order to move to a new place , which could affect the next generation that might confront a multicultural society .
Consequently , drought has led to severe social impacts of natural disasters .
In conclusion , catastrophes such as drought have produced immense economic and social impacts .
Not only human beings but also all the organisms are confronting the threat from climate - related natural disasters .
The fact is natural disasters have changed people and animal 's living environment bringing about a multitude of influences in both direct economic revenue of farmers and indirect effects on enterprise .
Additionally , climate change relates to natural disasters also causes farming which has triggered death and forced people as well as animals leave their home . More seriously , climate is continuingly changing and still contributing to natural disasters .
Perhaps I am being a little wishful thinking .
It is too early is n't ?
It 's to early to talk about love at this day and age .
Everything seems to strange when you fifteen and you are talking about love .
Well , that question has been ringing in my mind for so many months .
To me , falling in love , is to accept and admire those little things that exist in that human being .
So why bother loving someone who will never return that love back ?
Their life will be happier when you ceased to exist .
Yes , it hurts , but at the end of the day , almost everything in this world , will make you bleed .
It will make you feel vulnerable but that is life .
They will always love you base on your looks then personality .

Some people do not think of walking as a sport , they believe that a sport has to be a rough activity one that left you overtired and sweeting .
But in my opinion a sport is any activity that requires a certain amount of physical activity , one that can help you to improve your health .
I enjoy walking because it allows you to do physical exercise and talk , watch the landscape or do other things at the same time .
If you are young you could walk fast , if you are old or not especially fit , you could start walking at a slow pace and with time improve your performance
I would like to give some advice to the people who want to start walking : Take your time , do not want to walk ten kilometers the first day , try first short walks and every day increase the distance .
You will find yourself walking a little longer and faster than the day before .
And if you do that then , sooner than later , you will become a walking enthusiast
It was a sunny day of April .
Everyone in the house was so excited about it but not Michael .
He knew that soon he will must face his most powerful enemy , the Easter Bunny .
He used to dream him coming in his bedroom , laughing out loud showing off his sharp teeth , threating him with the most horrible punishments .
He was home alone baby - sitting his two year old sister .
All of a sudden he heard somebody knocking at the front door .
He grabbed the phone trying to call his parents .
In a flash his brain sent him a signal and he realized it was only a dream .
He decided it 's time to face his enemy .
He put his hand on the handle and without thinking too much he opened the door .
He did n't have time to get scared because all what he was thinking was why he does n't wake up at once .
I think it is true that colour do influence our decision when we buy different things .
No doubt that manufacturers know which colour is popular and fashionable in a particular season and correspondingly it means that things of this colour will be sold well .
For instance , I have recently read that people who belong to middle class prefer pink and green colours due to some psychological reasons .
That is why the predominant colour in McDonald 's is red likewise in some other cafes and restaurants .
For example , if I liked a thing , I would not think much about its colour or a colour of the shop where I found it .
Moreover , for many people the main factor is a price of a thing but not its colour .
To some up briefly , I would like to say that there is a special branch of psychology which investigates consumers ' tastes and factors which influence their choice .
Thus , we can conclude that colour is a powerful tool but in the same way manufacturers and retail companies should take into consideration other factors .
My friendship with Jessie started the first exciting day of kindergarten .
We first met at the swings , she smiled and I knew we were going to be friends forever .
I asked her if she wanted a sweet and timidly , she nodded .
When the break was over we went hand in hand to our classroom .
We love doing sleepovers , watch movies and going on holidays together .
It is generally accepted that television is providing us by far the best and easiest way to stay in touch with the whole world , while relaxing on our sofa , taking some time off from our housework .
This is the innovation that such a worldwide media is bringing to our society .
Anyway , I wonder whether it would be useful and able to increase our culture and help us to be more critic towards life rather than impose its power on us .
A recent research shows us why there is always an increasing number of children who are getting used to spend most of their afternoons in front of the television , not to miss a new cartoon nor a well - known film : they seem like they are unaware of the existence of documentaries , news and all the other educative programmes which today televisions are plenty of .
It has been suggested by some European governments to introduce televisions in schools to give the opportunity to discuss together about present topics and problems , in order to learn something more about the world we are living in .
In view of the above arguments , I would suggest anyone to cut out on television in order to have more time to read newspapers daily .
In my opinion there is future for public transport .
Firstly public transport is useful for people that can not afford a car and their work is far away from where they live .
Secondly public transport is better for the environment than using cars because a bus has more space than a car and many people can go on a bus thus decreasing the amount of pollution and helping the enviromnent .
Lastly if the use of public transport decreases drastically or stops many people will be unemployed , they could not win more money and buy cars for going from one place to another .
The countries will have Crisis and this will probably lead to another World War .
That will be a complete disaster because now we have nuclear weapons and we would destroy the world .
In conclusion public transport is very important for every person in some way and without it everything will be a disaster
Unless you get a job in that year , to keep you busy , or do whatever that keeps you focused and gives you a routine , you should n't take a year off at all .
Without the routine that studying gives you , with all the dealines , the exams , and other stuff that forces you to get things done , and , by consequence , teaches you to be a responsible person , which you would need to be when you get a job , you will simple be wasting one year of your life by taking a break .
One thing that I 've learned in my life is that you never should take a break from your everyday routine unless you really need , due to fatigue or some other physical or pscychological reason , otherwise you will be , I repeat , just wasting time , time that you could be spending in an usefull way , by getting something done , or improving yourself academically , intelectualy or doing whatever you think that can enrich your life .
I 've wasted so much time in my life that even I found it embarrassing .
I like to beleieve that , like the old Latin proverb says ( and I have already said this ) , there will be glory at the end to the man who endures hardships in his path .
Maybe one day I will experience the glory that awaits at high places those who walk through the narrow paths of life .
Regardless of what 's waiting for me at the end , I will never give up walking through those hard paths no matter how challenging and hard they may be .
This is some intimate stuff I 'm sharing with you my teacher .
I hope you do n't think that sharing these thoughts with you makes you my new best buddie .
I am writing in reply to your advertisment published in the local newspaper for the vancancy of Junior Chef .
Moreover , I am currently undertaking a Chef Training Course which provides me , not only practical but also theorical knowledge .
Furthermore , I alwyas try to maintain a positive attitude towards my responsibilities and sort out any problem that may occur .
Yours Faithfully ,
I was as happy as a lark but soon it was getting dark .
My leg was injured and it was as painful as a thorn in the paw ; after countless hours of crawling .
Leaning forward slowly , I started crawling slowly like a turtle along the slender hill ; I was on all four !
After a long and tiring crawl , I needed to find a shelter from where I could seek refuge from the chilling wind howling over my head unabated .
Suddenly I saw a small gap between two blocks of snowy hills just enough for me to lie down in .
But before I knew it I was asleep .
Looking down at the watch on my wrist , I realized it had been nearly a week since I survived the fall over the snowy cliff and now I had to go through this all alone with no improvement to my dire predicament .
I continued crawling on all four while wondering , for how much longer , Simon till we meet again .
I never stopped praying all along ; in hope that somehow , somewhere , someone would come along to rescue me .
As I was climbing downhill , I found myself getting blisters on my palm in a manner I could have no control over .
The pain was excruciating but I just had to move on as if I ever hoped to survive my ordeal !
As quickly as I could , I managed to get myself to the nearest leafless tree that I could find where I leaned my back against it to try to gain whatever support I could muster with the little energy that I had left in my body .
Emphatically I reminded myself that I should n't have survived had it not been for God 's help !
With the pain , doubts , hunger all crashing down on me , I was about to give up my fight for ultimate survival .
A second thought crossed my mind telling me that I would miss my family and my best friends !
I had to carry on to fight to stay alive !
Hello Sir / Miss .
My name is Alexandra kennedy .
I 'm 29 , I have a 9 year old daughter .
I was born in Russia , but lived in many different countries around the world .
I have got a family of my own , so I am familiar with looking after children and taking care of them . I enjoy fitness - and can easily help organise children sport activities .
I am also quiet experienced in the kitchen . I am really into healthy nutrition and healthy cooking .
It is important for children to get healthy meals , especially at the age of early teenage years .
I wo n't be afraid of any sort of jobs , I am ready for an adventure !
She is a great woman hardworking , responsible , kind , friendly , intelligent and an amazing person .
She was my firs teacher who was taught me repeat the first word and took my hand to give my first step .
I have fond memories from my childhood , she was always cheering me up when I was in my sad or difficult times , even when she was not feeing well .
Due to the interest in protecting animals , people are eager to take part in organizations such as World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) which is an international non - governmental organization working on issues regarding the conservation , research and restoration of the environment .
This is clearly seen when driving in the route and suddenly you see a bull or a cow in the middle of the way .
this may cause not only the animal death by being run over but also the passengers ' death if the driver tries to stop and lose the control of the car .
First of all , I would like to say that the young people have worse health nowadays .
It is our fault because we have let the companies to profit from our own sins .
We are made of flesh and it can be very difficult to resist the temptation .
You should take a look at the things your children have at their reach .
Therefore , I call to action .
Kateryna was born in 1988 in Siberia , RF in the family of Ukrainian Tatars .
The art of writing letters along with painting colorful mandalas were taught by her grandmother .
A huge mirror in her bedroom made a child believe that one is able to travel through it anywhere .
She loved watching printer at work producing numerous results of psychology tests , which she had just passed .
She graduated the high - school at the age of 15 .
By this time she had been spending almost all her free time near the computer .
She devoted all her free time to experiments on linking the math homework with programming of the music equalizer .
She graduated Kiev International University in 2009 .
Kateryna was frustrated with classic film genre and started looking for possibilities for realization of experimental theoretical ideas on practice .
After taking part in numerous festivals and concerts she had finally entered a joint British - Russian program for training socio - cultural managers in the cultural sphere .
The sport that I like the most is Dancing .
It may sound weird or even wrong for some people , because there are many of them that do n't even consider dancing as a sport ... but for me , and for everyone that has ever done dancing , it is not only a sport , but a very difficult one .
Dancing requires a lot of things , like cordination , flexibility , and physical condition , just to mention a few .
But despite how hard dancing can be , it is also really fun , and that 's actually what makes me enjoy it the most .
However , I would advise people who would like to start dancing to really take it serious , because even though I said it is fun , it really does require commitment and discipline .
The influence of the grown - ups : great or not so ?
Recently I have listened to a discussion on how adults can be a good influence on young people .
This got me thinking , how do adults influence the behaviour of youngsters ?
And is this always a good influence , or should adults interfere less with the behaviour of younger people ?
This can differ from the rules your parents have set for you , to the laws created by the governmen .
Secondly , adults can offer advice to the youngsters .
This might be of great influence on youngster , for adults are seen as the wiser people .
Think of celebrities for example .
They are of great influence on younger people .
So when admirable adults set good examples for youngsters , they can influence behaviour in a positive way .
Especially when they have to live under a great lot of rules .
This is because adults lived in a complete other time , so their advice might be outdated .
Lastly , when a wrong example is set , this can influence behaviour in a negative way , because they 'll try to act to this wrong example .
Today we will make a spotlight on the famous facts and myths about " Frozen shoulder " .
1- Most of the patients believe they have got frozen shoulder due to a trauma or injury in the shoulder joint , but this is a myth because frozen shoulder can occur after a trauma or even without any trauma as in elderly people especially those who have diabetes and those recovering from an operation .
2- If you believe that doing exercises worsens your condition , then that is another myth because frozen shoulder occurs to people who stop or decrease using their shoulder joint for a long time .
Usually after major operations , having a stroke or bone fracture .
They ignore using full range of joint motion to avoid the pain sensation .
So an inflammatory response starts leading to the joint stiffness , movement becomes painful and range of movement is limited by time .
3- An important fact about frozen shoulder is that no surgeries are usually needed .
The first treatment that your doctor will suggest is medications such as analgesics and paracetamol .
In addition to this , physical therapy is also an important way of treatment to maintain a full range of movement .
Cortisone injections are also helpful , these injections can improve everything ; decrease swelling , stiffness and pain .
You can never have a frozen shoulder if you followed these advices :
- If you had a surgery or an injury , you should keep moving your shoulder joint within a limit even if it is painful .
- Physiotherapy is not only about exercises , some physiotherapy techniques can decrease your pain and suffering .
The aim of this report is to inform an international organisation how our town takes care of the environment as well as what do people do with their rubbish and how the town is trying to keep the area clean and attractive .
Nowadays young children are well informed about the dynamics and the complexity about the pollution cycle .
Besides the fact that adults were not as well taught as children in school , they are the most civilized and responsible .
A study shows that adults take care of their personal garbage not just because of their education but because of their anxiety to show their kids that they are a great and responsible parents .
Every year we nominate a person that is responsible for supervising the dustman 's work every single day .
As far as I am concerned there are now a few rules in our town legislation that if you do not take care of your garbage or if you take papers to the floor you will have to pay a fine .
However , everything starts at the level of education that every human being receives .
Unfortunately , there is still a long way to do in terms environment concerns , but some of this solutions suggested by the mayor help us stopping the pollution .
There are some kinds of pollution such as garbage and wasted bottles , but some pollution is invisible such as noise and dirty air .
They have already had great impact on people 's life .
However air pollution affects not only people health but also the whole environmental system .
China is a big industrial country so there are a great number of factories and trucks .
CO2 can destroy the ozone .
If we do n't start to face this problem , we will hurt this planet we live in .
Environmental problems that touch us all .
Not only the government should make laws to control the situation but also we should do our best not to create more pollution .
For Example , if you do n't smoke , you wo n't cause air pollution and you wo n't damage your health ; if you use public transportation , walk more or take bicycle as your transportation , you will not only help reduce the pollution bust also improve your health .
Also , planting more trees instead of cutting them to purify our breathing air and reduce air pollution .
While there are many things to appreciate and celebrate about the world in which we live many pressing environmental problems cry out for our attention .
To maintain the only earth we live in is now the major issue for us nowadays .
Was 31st October .
It was dark outside , the weather was windy and the leaves fell from the trees .
When Alison came to she did not see any people .
When it was already 10 pm suddenly a car appeared in the dark .
Finally , she saw the lights of the approaching car and ran toward the car .
Therefore , it would be incredible expensive to reunite all of them again for another film .
At that moment he seemed like the new Steven Spielberg .
Nowadays he has turned into another director .
It has a pair of good tunes and they use them .
The script is made of pure gold .
It is so tightly knitted you do not realise it is telling you the story of a failure .
Dear Prof . Findlay ,
I am excited to apply for the Course Materials Writer position available at your company .
I have a MSc in Food Science and PhD in Biochemistry .
My scientific work was published in seven scientific articles .
Moreover , in a position as a Medical Writer I wrote scientific documents for clients in the pharmaceutical industry .
Furthermore , I was a writer and editor for the project Food Info , a platform to inform the general public about food science related topics .
The advertised position is very appealing for me because I have always been fascinated about nutrition and natural therapies .
I would be very motivated to contribute to the development of excellent education material for the Faculty of Health and Wellness of Think Education .
I am a very dynamic , creative and proactive person and I possess a strong work ethic .
The modern times have raised the concern about the environment , climate change and energy .
The public transportation can help fighting greenhouse gas emissions and can help us protect the world from Climate change effects .
In the recent years there has been a great change in consumption habits .
Now days , people can choose the most convenient way of travelling and there is no doubt that using a private car is easy , cheap and fun .
In developing countries , there is still a low level of awareness about the side effects of using private polluting cars .
But in modern countries , the environmental effects of one 's behavior is becoming important and concerning .
In my opinion it is just a matter of time until all the transportation options will be public and the private cars will be left behind .
People 's life will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
We can know this just by comparing the life now and 50 years ago .
Although now we have very advanced technology which has made our lives completely different and comfortable than before , in the future it will be much better than this .
We will definitely have better drugs and also less incurable diseases .
However , it is possible that along new inventions and research there might be more harmful viruses also .
There are some downsides of an advanced world too , for example , people will be more unhealthy due to the environmental conditions and also less self - reliant because of the technology progress .
Many parents face a dilemma when choosing the type of education they wish to give to their children and one of the first decisions they must take is what type of school they would like their children to attend and whether it should be a single sex school or a mixed sex one .
It can not escape our minds that at this stage and age , children are exposed to sexual images from a very early age and some people would argue that our society is hyper sexualised , which is a reason why many parents see single sex schools as a means to protect their offspring from having sexual thoughts before they are ready to understand the complexity of sex and sexual relationships .
While the hyper sexualisation of our society may be a reality that many parents would want to protect their children from , it is true to say that children need to adapt and be ready for the society in which they live and for may parents , sending their children to a mixed sex school is just a natural environment , much more similar to the " outside world " in which they would grow to adulthood .
Considering how much time children spend at school , it appears to me that choosing a single sex school will make the child , somehow , segregated and in many cases , reinforce some of the may stereotypes that we , as society , have regarding gender which , if we take into consideration that these children are going to be the future leaders , educators , lawyers , politicians and so on , I would argue that the more schools reflect our society and the way that we like it to be , the better , not only for the child as a person , but the child as a key in the future of the country and , as an extent , to the world .
Therefore and to sum up , Is my view , that public money is better spent supporting mix sex schools , which reflects the society we live in , as opposed to single sex ' which may reinforce those stereotypes that are mining society .
I absolutely agree with this statement . Travelling by car is not only much more convenient than public transport , it also grants one 's independence to go wherever and whenever one might wish .
The car industry could also be considered one of the main driving engines of the Western economy .
It is true that cars pollute the atmosphere , but it is also true that the emissions from public transport also contribute to pollution - some would say that even more than private transport , as Diesel motors are particularly dirtier and more inefficient than smaller , petrol driven motors like those of private cars .
All things considered we might conclude that public transport will eventually disappear in the short term and in no time everyone will be driving their own clean - energy - driven flying cars to go everywhere .
Currently I am working as a teacher of English in my city of Dnipropetrovsk .
Nowadays it is important to be a role model for your pupils - so I try to keep fit and show modern movies about staying healthy .
I consider myself to be ideally suited for this job for several reasons .
First of all , I have considerable experience in working with teenagers ( for more than 5 years ) which I find really enjoyable .
Second , I am quite energetic , open , active and educated person .
And finally , I am kind of person who is responsible , well - organised and optimistic .
And , of course , to add up an extra actvity to my CV as I am used to do every summer .
Looking forward to your reply .
However , others claim that it is vital for societies and next generations .
According to supporters of it , there are many benefits of genetic engineering .
As it is known , it is used to produce crops that are more resistant to insects and diseases .
Supporters also claim that , it is vital for some countries which are struggling with famine .
The other benefit is about human life .
Genes could be changed before a baby is born thus , inherited illnesses would no longer exist .
In spite of the benefits , there are also certain drawbacks of human genetic engineering .
Another problem is the genetically modified food products .
In conclusion , it seems the benefits outweigh the drawbacks of human genetic engineering .
Not only did they share a clear interest in writing about social issues that struck the contemporary life in Britain , but they also had similar ways of structuring their novels .
In both novels the writers also dealt with the mistreatment of children in workhouses ( " David Copperfield " ) and Boarding Schools ( " Jane Eyre " ) .
In Dickens ' novels Realism allows the readers to know how tough London society was in that period .
It was a narrow street lined up by two - story buildings on the floor of which shops , pubs were flashing their neon signs .
What he did n't know , or just could n't accept , was he was unwilling to tolerate other people 's views , and jokes that 's why he packed my things and asked me to find another place to stay .
The reason ? I told him I found a job in another city and I was considering moving house .
I explained to him it was the chance of my life given that good jobs for women are difficult to find , pay is n't the same as for men and I felt I did n't receive the status men in my company enjoyed .
I mean it was a joke I made and I had no real intention to leave him .
I must have seem cruel to him because , despite our daily disagreements , he adored me and was serious about settling down soon .
As you know , I helped at a concert of U2 last month and I 'd like to tell you something more about it .
It was , of course , a ones in a lifetime opportunity , one I grabbed with both hands .
When you hear you are asked to help out in a concert of your favourite band , you ca n't refuse .
I must say that not all of them are veru easy to work with .
The things some of them wanted , unbelievable!Luckily , I had some other students helping me find all the curious things for the famous .
Despite all the hard work I had to do , I would not have to think twice if they ask me to do it again .
Not to say that now I have some good connections in the world of the rich and famous !
Due to the ever - increasing population coupled with the climate change , food shortage has become a significant facing by many countries .
Some assert that genetically modified technology can be applied to address this problem .
This essay will argue that genetically modified food can be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increasing food yield .
It is well known that the GM food is inserted with various resistance genes , such as pest disease resistance gene .
This means that the food being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases can minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment .
This reduction in the application of chemical materials can create a safer agricultural environment , ensuring food safety .
Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology , such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance , GM food can ensure the food production in the period of drought .
Actually , thousands of tests on GM food , before bring it into markets , have been proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health .
In conclusion , it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with the less use of chemicals .
In views of this , it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortage .
However , because there are some disadvantages in GM technology which is being developed , it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food .
When a student came in , also he was surprised to see so many people inside , but , after a while , he realized what was really happening : dozens of wet raincoats had been left on the chairs by students of another course .
The student did n't have the courage to interrupt his teacher and give him such a strong pain and disillusion : he slunk away while the old professor was still speaking enthusiastically to nobody .
Students Use of Leisure Time
On 3th March 2014 , a survey was conducted among 60 students .
The purpose of the survey was to discover popular leisure time activities of male and female students .
It has been found in the first section that a large percentage of the male respondents preferred to stay at home on holidays , while 90% of the female students would like to go to the seaside .
In the second section both the girls and the boys interrogated claimed that they do n't spend their free time going to the theatre or the opera .
For example , only 10% percent of the boys never do that and 24% go to nightspots at least one time a week .
More than a half of the male students spend their spare time doing sport two and more times a week .
Unlike the boys the female respondents usually do n't feel like going in for sport at leisure .
In contrast to the male respondents the girls interrogated go to evening classes in their free time .
Like the male respondents the girls interrogated go regularly to the cinema .
For instance , 47% of the female respondents watch films on a big screen every week .
In the third part of the questionnaire was found out that the male respondents are similar to the girl respondents in that they both enjoy listening to music at home more than 2 hours a day .
In contrast to the girls interrogated who almost never play computer games the majority of the male students gamble for hours at leisure .
The female respondents are more fond of reading books that the male ones .
40% of the girls read books several hours a day , while 13% of the male students do n't read in their free time at all .
The males who filled in the questionnaire and the females alike spend many hours by surfing the Internet .
For example , 53% of the female students are on - line more than 3 hours a day .
If any conclusions may be drawn from the data , they are as follows .
There is an evident tendency to the decline in the active ways of spending free time .
The young people of both sexes prefer to be on - line or playing computer games at leisure .
According to the findings , it is clear that nowadays going to nightclubs and cinemas are more popular than going to theatres and operas or visiting historical places .
There are therefore a clear need for young people to prefer active and educating leisure time activities to passive ones .
Please accept our dearest apologies ; it was the least of our intentions to offend you with our release letter , which is a standard format authorized by our legal department .
Of course you can share your opinions and experiences about your stay wherever and with whoever you wish .
There has never been any intention of hiding the truth as you said .
In addition , we are sorry that your holiday experience was affected by the fire occurred on Saturday October 10th , 2015 .
It was not an easy task to find a new accommodation and relocate over a thousand people .
We do know that the incident might have caused some inconveniences , but the most important thing is that none of our guests or staff was injured .
We are sorry for the time it took to relocate you , the least we could do was to offer you an upgraded room at Paraiso Mar y Beach .
We hope that our explanations and apologies will make you change your mind and that you give us another chance in the future to provide you with a much more delightful experience .
Given the circumstances we would like to offer one of the following compensations if you decide to travel with us again in the future :
In my opinion many people depend on public transport to get to their place of work , university or school .
If you compare the price of petrol with the price of a bus ticket you can clearly see how much better it is to travel by bus .
I enjoy travelling by bus or train , on your journey you can read or just look through the windows .
However , I must agree that travelling by car can give you more freedomn , you can carry your shopping and pick up other people on the way .
Furthermore , you can choose what time you would like to travel and where .
But despite all this there will always be people without a car who needs to commute every day so there is a long future for public transport .
As long as people keep accepting this technology for communication , social media sites will also keep proceeding to the next step and affecting the society .
In terms of the communication society , they will possibly change the way in which people develop relationship with each other , and consequently , they will create two types of culture : communal and agentic .
In the former , people have ability almost equally , and value interpersonal relationship .
These types of culture will oppositely exist in the future as an effect of social media sites .
There is nothing worse than not be able to communicate with people when you 're in a foreign country .
It might be such a frustrating sensation that you could n't want to go back again .
This article deal with the benefits and drawbacks , if there are any , of learning another language .
On the one hand you 'll feel more active and you 'll realise how your brain memory gets better and better .
Besides , you 'll understand the native people when you 're going on holiday .
This could be a drawback because not all the people are up to the task .
To wrap up the article I 'd strongly recommend that young people to learn at least a new foreign language especially if you 're a student .
Nowadays , famous people like movie stars , politicians , models and other celebrities suffer from lack of privacy .
They are also the reason for many problems , which appear in private lives of some celebrities .
It is known , that it is the job of paparazzi to follow famous people and look for sensation in their daily behaviour and celebs are aware of the fact , that they are recognised everywhere , but an interest in one 's private life , when the person does n't want to is basically a synonim for trespassing .
I strongly agree with the statement , that famous people also should have their own private lives , which no one 's following and that no one knows about it .
It is very hard to lead a normal life , when you have to think all day long , about what you say , what you wear and first of all , what you do .
Being a celebrity means working all the time , you have not a single moment to relax and forget about your work .
On the other hand , it is obvious that people want to know everything they can about celebrities they like or admire and journalists give them the opportunity to find out some information about their lives , but they often cross the line and literally deprive these famous people of private life .
In my opinion everyone deserves to have a private life even if he is a public person .
I 'm sure that no one would like to see his photo in a newspaper , on which he 's eating or making a stupid face and that 's why we should respect other 's privacy .
Everything that goes on in the famous person 's life , including births , deaths , illness and divorces is fodder for the tabloids .
If the individual stumbles , whether figuratively or literally , speculation about him will end up on TV , on the Internet or the front page of the tabloids .
They think that due to scandals they will be able to get fame , live in the lap of luxury and have a lot of money .
On the other hand , not everybody prefers to reveal the secrets of the private life .
For these kinds of people it is important not to bring out family scenes and problems , as they do n't want to be disputed in public .
When you clock out at work , no one has the right to make you keep working .
As it seems to me , private information about stars should be published if they approve of it putting the signature .
It would be fairly by celebrities .
I 'm glad to hear that you 've decided to take part in an organisation of this month 's concert .
I hope you find it useful as I did last month .
I 'm writing to tell you about my experience I gained during preparations for the last concert .
As a volunteer I was helping make meals for VIP guests .
I know it could be a problem for you since you ca n't cook , but organisers need volunteers in many fields : scenography , sounding , VIP - escort .
Nowadays almost everyone in the world has contact with computers and the great majority of them have been using the Internet .
However , Facebook , as well as many other social networking sites , has its dark side too .
It may lead to inefficiency at school - or workplace - or even sleeping disorders .
Nowadays , anyone can take a photo from the web and assume it 's theirs .
And also , lets not forget that going out with friends from time to time wo n't hurt anyone .
The Soviet Union collapse has become one of the defining events in the world 's history .
It influenced the further development of post - Soviet countries as well geopolitical situation in the whole world .
It has also influenced the international relations not just within post - Soviet area , but also in the entire world , as the period after the collapse of the USSR was marked as crash of bipolar structure of international relations .
So long as for fifty years the world lived under the shadow of the Cold War , fearing a fatal confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union , the dissolution of the USSR had a huge resonance not only in the US mass - media but also in the American society .
American press had widely illustrated the revolution in the Baltic States and the tension which has been spread in the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall as well as the fall of communist governments within the whole former Soviet Bloc .
The tensions in the Soviet Union came to its peak in August 1991 , while Gorbachev was on vacation in the Crimea , a group of right wing military and KGB leaders staged a coup in Moscow .
The"New York Times " made a series of publications dedicated to the coup .
The articles headlined " Soviet crisis " have broadly described the situation in the capital of Russia .
On the August 20 , " New York Times " published the article which contained the excerpts from the news conference held by Acting President Gennadiy Yanayev and four other members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency .
The American press summing up the era of Gorbachov frequently highlighted his attempts to increase the openness of the Soviet society .
The buried secrets of past regimes and the foibles of the present one were exposed to public scrutiny by a press " - the New York Times wrote .
The plotters have immediately encountered strong opposition from the leadership of the RSFSR leaders under the guidance of President Boris Yeltsin .
Tens of thousands hit the streets in Russia in order to defend the democracy .
Decisive actions of Yeltsin have been supported by most world governments and international communities .
Boris Yeltsin has gained international acclaim when he occupied the Russian White House and faced down the threats of the coup 's leaders .
The coup , due to lack of organization and support by the military forces , failed three days after .
The person of Boris Yeltsin has become the most popular one in that time world 's press .
Leading articles of the most read newspapers in the States were dedicated to the first Russian president .
American newspapers wrote that Boris Yeltsin acquired new status for his defiant stand , also mentioning that the people had knew a little about him .
The article of the New York Post " THE SOVIET CRISIS ; Yeltsin 's Remarks : A ' Reactionary Coup " refers to the night of 18 - 19 August 1991 when the legally elected President of the country was removed from power .
The author lays the stress on the democratic processes in the country which have acquired broad and irreversible character .
Also it shows the disposition of the soviet people towards the changes in the country . "
This coup had a big resonance among the American society ; consequently the US mass - media were eager to know the feelings of the US citizens about the situation in the Soviet Union .
The US citizen deemed the crisis as a menace for the liberalisation of society ; they assumed it as an actual barrier for the expression of people 's will . "
The press accentuated that many of Americans dusted off fears left over from the Cold War were harshly reminding that this is still the nuclear age .
The dissolution of the Communist party has also become one of most popular issues among American mass - media .
The reduction of Gorbachov 's role and the growth of the Yeltsin 's haven't been out of the attention in the US media sources .
Russian President Boris Yeltsin proposed a radical restructuring of the Soviet Union that would minimize the role of Mikhail Gorbachev and reduce the USSR to a loose confederation of nine republics . "
The Communist Party , which has had control for 74 years , is rapidly dissolving - the Chicago Tribune wrote .
The US mass - media followed the reaction on the crisis inside Communist party closely One of the articles of the Washington post " Soviet Turmoil Shakes Europe 's Communists " tells that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev 's call for dissolution of the Communist Party Central Committee has called into question the survival of its satellite parties in Western Europe .
The dissolution of the Communist party was concerned as the one of the features of the Soviet Union collapse .
In the Washington Post the editorial remarks that the failure of the Moscow coup has finally broke the influence of the Communist Party over the power structures and the world outlook of Soviet people .
The upshot of the matter is that the dissolution of the Soviet Union has caused the formation of the new states and following referendums on their independence .
The official collapse of the Soviet Union has occurred in December 1991 .
On the 25th of December 1991 Gorbachov has officially resigned .
The Washington Post has written down : " a spokesman for Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that the Soviet Union will cease to exist by the end of 1991 .
Soviet époque , which had existed for 74 years , came to its end and this paved the way for establishment of new independent republics .
" What young people are interested in ? "
As requested I interviewed a large number of young people , trying to understand their main interests , especially as regards music , TV programmes and clothes .
Many people aged between fourteen and eighteen said that the most listened music among teenagers is definitely rock music .
Only a few youngsters listen to classical music and love the Opera .
The people I interviewed are very keen on reality shows like " Big Brother " and similar but I have to say that many of them are also interested in cooking shows and documentaries .
Finally , regarding to the clothes , young people declared to prefer casual outfits like jeans , t - shirts etc .
In the whole , I think that young people have now a large variety of interests .
A world where everybody is able to communicate in the same language - is that pure utopia or may it be a considerable idea ?
What would the possible advantages and disadvantages of a world wide spoken language be ?
Establishing English as the new worldwide spoken language might be a favourable example since English is already spoken by more than 300 million native speakers and therefore the third most spoken language in the world , according to Ethnologue .
Moreover English is already a universal language used by many people to communicate or negotiating within the business market .
However , the realisation of English as a world language would certainly need an educational basis for everyone which might not be easy to accomplish but it would be possible .
While teaching everyone English it would also be profitable to instruct basic knowledge in mathematics , physics or other relevant topics which might be helpful .
Such a standardised educational system for every single person on the world would therefore not only benefit the communication or existing businesses but also help third - world countries to start companies , trade and industrialise their countries so they can take care of themselves and emerge out of poverty .
Moreover , the standardised educational system would also need people who teach and instruct others so the world language will be established everywhere .
In order to accomplish this endowment there would be a necessity of teachers which leads to many new job opportunities .
After all , a couple of professions might become extinct , for example translators , but , therefore , the organisation and execution of this big project would provide a range of other jobs which can make up for the ones lost .
The educational system would also provide a valuable basis for the world of politics so conflicts might be prevented due to the lost language barrier with its vulnerability and risks of misunderstandings .
In addition , civil wars or catastrophes like the Arab spring might also be avoided since there will be an educational standard which could teach different ways of political leadership .
However , this great improvement still holds a few weaknesses .
On the one hand there would be a great loss of cultures and in some cases the implementation of the educational system might be impossible , for instance the aboriginal people .
Anyway , , those tribes would not even need or want an education or a world language because it is their way of life to live in groups together with the nature and disturbing these cultural groups would simply be unnecessary .
On the other hand the suggestion of English as the world wide spoken language might be up against much criticism since the United States do not have many supporters everywhere .
Nevertheless , English was just a suggestion and other languages like Spanish or Chinese could certainly be used as well .
Is it really that the end of public transport is soon to come ?
I hold an opposite view ; my answer is " no " , for sure .
Yes , they are right in saying so and in fact , many people are second - hand car owners .
But they seem to have forgotten the extra cost incurred by maintenance and repair , and , of course , buying petroleum .
The cost of having a car is hence not as cheap as we think if we also take into account those avoidable extra cost .
Under this circumstance , some people may rather take public transport to save money for their " dream house " rather than buying a car .
It is clearly seen that there is still much room for survival for public transport .
Secondly , even people have cars , they may also take public transport .
As we all know , Hong Kong is famous for scarcity of land , there are not many parking spaces available , so employees may not be granted an official parking space by their company are hence may resort to public transport if they want to avoid the fees of using the parking lot .
Greenhouse gases have already posed grave threat to humans , e.g. global warming and ozone depletion , which raised people 's environmental awareness .
Hence , contrary to many people perceive , there should be an increasing demand , i.e. a rosy future , for public transport .
From the reasons mentioned above , it is obvious that the doomsday of public transport is definitely not something down the line .
But how about the future further far away ?
Like our ancestors would have never imagined that we can now fly in the sky by plane .
Technological advancement is , after all , always something that drops us a bombshell , so rapid that we can never predict how far it can go .
Maybe one day we need no cars , or public transport .
Simply by thinking of a specific location , we can go there in a split second .
There 's not much work you have to do on a normal day , but maybe this will be a special one , because of the match between Celta and Real Madrid that is going to be celebrated half a kilometre away .
Once you close it , it would be great if you could let the keys in David 's house , which is in the same building .
There is about 14 workers in the shop , divided in 2 groups with different schedule each one .
They have similar skills and productivity , but , honestly , I prefer working with the morning one . I do n't think you 'll have any problem with both groups .
If there is any problem with the cash registrer ( very common , actually ) , you have a phone number under it of a good technician .
The bill will be assumed by us .
Write back soon and let me know if you have any concern .
However , it is one of the most motivating challenge in our lives .
They are in constant adaptation to new events or personal experiences .
For example , a close relationship or a serious illness make us look at the world around us through different eyes , and also they let us grow into more interesting and nicer human beings .
Even so , change can be perceived as a disturbing question due to the fact that it provokes a strong feeling of uncertainty .
Furthermore , we sometimes feel scared to face new experience and then we can lose a perfect opportunity to improve ourselves .
In short , I consider that change is always the best way to develop our personality to become better people in any aspect of our lives because it represents a major challenge .
It is true that sometimes it is hard to accept certain changes but we can always learn something useful from them .
Are you ok ?
You said that your flight lands at 10.30 am so it 's better if you go to the train station near the airport .
When you get out of the airport you have to turn right and walk for ten minutes and then the station is right in front of you , it 's quite simple my friend ! I 've just looked the timetable and your train arrives at 11.04 am .
It 's about 6 euro .
So , do n't worry and take t - shirts and shorts !
Nowadays , there 's more to school than sitting quietly at the desk and saving mathematical equations .
Classes are being held much more interactive than in the previous years , and also subjects are supposed to prepare pupils for adult life .
In the following essay I want to discuss the most useful skills which should be taught in school from an early age on .
In order to prevent the younger generation of our society of consuming it , we should give them the possibility to attend cooking classes .
Not only is it an advantage for their health if they 're able to create healthy meals , but also does it strengthen relationships among classmates , as they might help and support each other while trying new dishes .
However , there 's still a more important area to have a good knowledge about - personal finance .
Teachers can take up the role of the parents and giving them a knowledge about finances and the right way to handle it .
To conclude , there are a lot of things worth considering to teach in school .
Both of them are skills which help managing your life later on , finances in particular .
Jake is a free lance .
He uses to travel from place to place following the most burning news around the world .
As a free lance , he has to invest in his ideas , hoping that someone will like his stories and buy them .
To fly in different continents is nowadays easy but still expensive .
A few months ago month he had been spending two weeks in Brussels .
He was following an important European summint on environmental issues .
Access to sevreal public transport services ( such as underground , buses , tram , etc . )
let him reach his working meeting always on time .
He also had the chance to know more about the diverse atmosphere characterizing each and every Brussels ' suburb .
During winter Brussels might be quite cold .
However , metros and buses are equipped with such a powerful heating systems that you forget about the cold .
He was able to reach the South by a connection flight from Rome .
It was spring , the prefect time to go and visit South of Italy .
Nevertheless , his stay was not as pleasant as he had thought .
Jake 's main challenge was to move around and reach the places he had planned to visit both for his research and for tourist purposes .
Its inhabitants move around exclusively on their own cars .
Towns are congested by traffic jam , especially during rush hours .
Such experience made Jake realise the considerable impact that a good public transport system has on people 's life and their surrouding .
Stress - it makes your life easier since you avoid driving in the middle of traffic jam
Communications - it eases movements from place to place
- access to public transport is way cheaper than taking care of your own car ; though initially it might look like a huge disbursment of money from the community , in the long term it shows to be the most efficient way to travel !
Although , I have been struck by its major draws such as Plaza De Espana , Real Alcazar and El Torre del Oro , this is the relaxed and social way of living which has most impressed me .
Therefore , it all comes down in this writing to expressing feelings about Seville and its surrounding .
Consequently , what are the reasons of my change of heart ?
The more I understand it the more I like it .
Luckily , this has not been the case so when it comes to Seville .
What 's more , Seville is bright , colourful and lively which cheers me up and relaxes me .
To make matters even better , there was some music played a few meters ahead , which contributed to liven up the spirit of everyone present there .
In addition to this , I really like sharing tapas dishes with people , drinking a good fresh " draft beer " and going for a " tapas crawl " with friends as in Switzerland each one gets its own dish when eating out and only go for a " pub crawl " .
I am also keen on wandering off at my own pace and getting lost on the winding narrow cobbled streets as I feel like an adventurer looking for new treasures .
Some of these are striking secluded places such churches or Moorish - styled houses .
Thus , scouring Seville is like rewinding the time and being propelled in the past .
It turns out to be now a very welcoming and relaxing place where warm - hearted people live and where I greatly enjoy spending some time .
This year , in Italy , for the first time in more than 200 years , it happened a weird coincidence : the political leader Silvio Berlusconi and the singer Ligabue marked their careers on the same day .
On the one hand , Berlusconi compromised his position when some journalists told the world some wiretappings of his which would compromise his future political career ; on the other , Luciano Ligabue won the award for the best song of the year , bringing his career ever forward .
If I had also a year free , I would only prefer travelling not working .
If you decide to ground in Geneva , I suggest you to visit first the north of Switzerland from the west to the east and then the south of Switzerland from the east to the west .
Switzerland is a small country also take your time and spend enough time in each place .
Concerning your inquiry on working in my country , it 's really difficult to get an authorisation to work , especially for periods longer than a week .
Therefore , I suggest you to work during your travelling time .
For instance if you plan to stay more than one week in Zermat in Wallis , think to try to find a place where you could help in a restaurant or a shop .
But if you prefer to work during a full three - month period , you should ask your employer a work permit .
She said that she would go out in five minutes .
Five more minutes went by , and he decided to get into the bungalow .
They both know what would happen if Tris 's husband found out a stranger in his house .
- I must find her before he does it .
First of all , the public transport is obsolete .
Finally you can choose who would travel with you .
It could seem to point towards public transport , nevertheless it will push car travelling even further .
In summary , the public transport is dying .
This TV serial is mainly based on working class people and represents various ethnic minority communities including African and Asian Muslims .
This show is particularly good as it represents how people from different ethnic backgrounds can engage with each other .
Although this soap involves a lot of cheating and plotting between characters , it also shows the importance of family values . I would definitely recommend this drama serial to other people .
It is important to gain awareness about different societies due to the fact that Britain is becoming such a multicultural society .
Second , people on the boats are granted the opportunity to see beautiful ocean lives , while taking a plane does n't provide this luxury to take a look at the birds in the sky for planes are travelling at such a high speed .
I am writing to complain about the suggested bar on smoking in public areas .
I am very concerned about this proposal , for a number of reasons .
To support my argument against this proposal I would like to explain what happened when the authorities attempted to introduce a ban on smoking in my home town .
In the first place , few people did know about this law , and , of course , most business opposed the idea .
If this happened in café Noir , probably I could lose my job .
In my opinion , introducing specific non - smoking areas in this type of establishments could be an excellent idea .
It 's not easy for me to talk about myself , but I 'll give my best .
I 've been living in Augsburg for nearly two years now and am studying B.A. Anglistik and economics .
Before moving to Augsburg , I studied biology for two semesters in Erlangen , but soon noticed that it was n't the right subject of study for me .
Biology is still a hobby of mine , but I 've always been good with languages and so I 'm doing now something I 'm naturally good at .
I can speak English and of course German - and because my grandparents are from Korea , a little Korean , too .
The good thing is : the rest of the time living with boys is as uncomplicated as it gets .
Also I visited the USA multiple times : I travelled the west coast from San Diego to San Francisco , I 've been to Las Vegas , Chicago and Boston .
I am a 23-year - old student in a Sports Science degree , so I am interested in sports .
Besides , I am open - minded , easy going and friendly .
I have experience in children Summer camps and recently I attended a First Aid course , so I could deal with a difficult situation .
Furthermore , I speak a little French .
I have no problem in being hired for three months because I do not go to the university in Summer .
It demands physical effort , being and excellent way to keep fit .
Starting with the social skills , it is obvious that a football match is a dispute , a game we involve in with the intention to win .
This kind of action , when peformed collectively , requires coordenation of efforts and abitity to work together , two qualities that are frequently forgotten in our individualistic world .
If you play footbal , you know how to act when in a team .
Moreover , footbal is a physical game .
Unlike chess or bridge , football makes you leap , run , kick .
In times of escalators and cars , it is refreshing to find an activity that involves movement , velocity and strenght .
In fact , it can be argued that the human virtues are a by - product of conflicts and fights ; that they are that traces of character that we aknowledge as important for everybody engaged in a competition , be it for a trophy or for a country .
It is a sport that develops no only the body , but also the mind and the heart .
In a club you will find professional advice and also as many peopole as it is necessary for a match .
In fact , if football has a downside , it is this , the fact that you need twenty - two people to set a match .
But , provided that , you will have one of the best ninety minutes of your entire life .

In the next following days , we mostly had bread and sandwiches for our meals .
During these 10 days , we walked a lot instead of catching a bus , because it saved money too .
This is kind of the real vacation for me .
Even though I was in a romantic city , I could n't enjoy my vacation in a romantic way due to the low budgets we had .
To me , a dream vacation is like going to a beautiful island like Palau , where I can enjoy the sunshine and the sea .
When I am there , I would start my day by calling room service for a wonderful breakfast in bed .
As the day goes on , I would also go swimming in the deep blue sea , go snorkeling or just lie on the beach .
This is the kind of dream vacation I want so bad .
There are always the differences between a real vacation and a dream vacation .
Once I have enough money , I will have my dream vacations come true .
When I finished the high school , I started working as accountant in my father 's carpentry .
He produces doors and windows on wood .
At the beginning it was really difficult to me because I was a little shy with customers and I was n't used to working among noisy machinery and shouting workers , but after a while time I learned to ignore all of that !
My father was happy because it was a great opportunity and understood that it was what I 've been dreaming for a long time .
Five years have passed and I 'm still working for this company which has given me a lot and I 've been learning many things about accounting .
In fact I am administrative manager and I feel really proud of myself .
Last but not least I 'm a great fashion expert because I work near the shopping streets !
Dear sir / madam ,
I would like to apply for the job which includes working in summer camps all over the USA .
My name is Aly Meeuws , I am 16 years old , I live in The Netherlands at the moment and I am really planning on going to the USA in the future , so this would difinitely be a great experience for me especially for my English and being away from home .
Until next summer I will still be in school but hopefully I will graduate so I can go to college afterwards .
Often after school I babysit my parents friends ' children and I usually really like it ! I am also a very athletic person so I would not mind entertaining the children for a longer period of time and also doing some physical exercises .
Besides that , I also really enjoy cooking with my mom at home so working in the kichens would not be a problem at all .
Once I cooked a Christmas dinner for me and my whole family and surprisingly everyone enjoyed it which definitely came as a surprised to me !
There has never been a bigger force for change than technology , it changes absolutely everything about the way we live , even the way we talk with each other .
Social Media such as Twitter , Facebook , Youtube and blogs illustrate surely that the definition or repercussion of digital technologies is created through the forms in which they are worn and the social relations and associations that expand around them .
This essay will discuss the implications of social media for everyday life , emphasizing the problems which arose with the use of Facebook and Twitter .
Finally it will look into possible future implications of this kind of technoogy .
Social networks websites can be explained as a web usefulness that admit people to create a public or semi - public profile , arrange a list of other contacts which is possible to share connection and look and cross their list of connections and those made by others within the system .
Namen and Kinnison ( 2012 ) indicates that " the three types of social interactions that social networking enables include ( 1 ) creaction of an online identity , ( 2 ) establishment of relationships between users , and ( 3 ) development of layered communities defined by the lists of connections each user establishes " .
Another rapidly expanding social networking is Twitter .
These kinds of websites allows people to interact with others precisely by smartphones or computers .
By Twitter , users post opinions or comments narrow to 140 characters .
On the other hand , on Facebook people can share pictures , vídeos and thoughts without restrictions .
As a result of an appropriate use of social networking tools in education , Javanovic , Chiong and Weise ( 2012 ) demonstrate that students adopt Facebook not especially for socialising but also for academic purposes , like to obtain benefit for their studies or to recover time in discovering learning resources ( p.39 ) .
Furthermore , some departments of police in the USA used Facebook to share a vídeo of a felony with the expectancy to identify the suspects and their followers were apt to say something about the incident in return to the publication .
Additionally , a politician from Philadelphia , USA was elected after take advantage of his Twitter account appropriately during his campaign .
My ex - husband taught me not to be involved with some kind of people by analyzing his behavior before commitment .
During our dating he was very charming and attentive .
We discussed about some sexist ideas that I do n't agree with what the society demands on people and I noticed a little sexism of him , but I was fine with that because That can happen , but due to my profession he could n't be like that for so long because I was in a man 's shoes .
He was very jealous but I thought it would fade away with time and with the gaining of the trust but it did not and ended up making me sick by the time passed .
I learned that a man does anything to conquer a woman , he even does a lot of hateful things for him such as going to her home every night to stay together or to hang out , while later you find out that he hates going to places except his house .
I learned a man says anything just to shut you up and not discuss just to have some love moments .
I also learned that men think in a different way from the women during the day .
For example , while women think about millions things like what they want to do or have to do during the day , while men just do nto think about anything and can be like that for hours , just whith a blank mind .
But in my opinion this should be an excuse to think something that women should n't know anything about .
I also learned that is the mother that gives the principles and the direction of a man 's mind , and depending on her he is going to be a sexist or not , he is going to help and be an honor man or not , he is going to be a good and caring father or not , he is going to be a responsible human being or not .
A mother is very fundamental and the basis for the men principles and beliefs .
Women do not knoe their importance for the future on their own homes .
They teach the same things over and over again and do not rethink if those beliefs and actions are really right to help the world change and be a better world for everyone .
Princess Sophie grew up , she was so unhappy because she could n't do anything , she was condemned to live in a room of the castle until someone could find the cure for her cursed .
One day she figured out how to escape through a hidden passage , she got to the town and ran and jump , she did every little thing she was n't aloud to since so long .
While she was having some fun , a handsome boy crashed her and she fall to the ground .
- I am so sorry Madam , excuse me for my blunder .
I am Michael .
The princess was a little scared of talking to someone she did n't know , because she never got to talk to anyone before , but still she answer him with a big smile - You are excused , my name is Sophie.- It truly was love at first sight .
Michael asked her to go with him for an ice cream so he could amend his fault .
Sophie accepted and they started a strong friendship that through the time became in more than just a friendship , they fall in love for each other .
Princess Sophie used to escape so she could meet with Michael , until one day , when she was just about to meet Michael to confess him all the truth about who she really was , a guards discovered her and the King commanded to lock her up in her room .
Princess Sophie send him a lot of letters telling him the truth about her , and about her cursed .
Michael decided to leave the kingdom , when he was just about to close the door he turned back to his coffee table and saw the letters , he had a hunch but he ignored it .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he has made a mistake .
What happens in future will be decided by what happens now .
People are advised to carpool and travel to work places .
Several announcements over radio and TV emphasize the need to use the public transport system for travelling to save nature .
People may choose to ignore the advice now but in future they may not have a choice .
One of the latest film I have seen is Silver Linings Playbook , played by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence .
It 's a comedy with romantic features and at the same time very realistic .
They meet by chance and started a tortuous relationship as friends .
Interestingly , they find the way to help each other and not surprisingly finally they fall in love .
I personally think that the film transmit an interesting view of the psychiatric illnesses and the importance of the family in this type of problems .
I strongly recommend you to go and see the film .
They enjoy both local bands ' production and some foreign songs .
Except classics like Friends , popular shows include How I Met Your Mother , The Big Bang and the new HBO talk show Last Week Tonight . I can say with high certainty that reality TV is no more in with young people in my country .
Most teens tend to create their unique style , often managing to start a fashion of their own .
This information can help the organizers of next year 's festival in choosing appropriate music and catering to a variety of tastes .
My friend Peter recently told me that he was moving out from his flat , so I asked him if he was willing to rent it .
Furthermore you will increase the course fee by 15% from next month .
In the future , you do not provide the Japanese course at convenient time .
I am very sorry but I can not accept this !
It 's about the story of a little boy that is haunted by a big secret , he is visited by ghosts .
The boy soon becomes friends with the psychologist , and he started noticing plenty of things about this exceptional boy .
I found this movie both exciting and emocional , both thumbs up for me !
As the secretary of the English Language club i am writing to propose that our club be given funding for the coming year .
Outline of the club activity
We regulary organise film projections and discussions around a subject related to the film .
For example , with every film seen our students have the chance to practice their language and to develop their own opinions , particularly as we always have discussions aroud a subject related to the film .
Also our monthly speakers are exellent , for example , last year we invited a well - known actrice , Janet Hewitt , to share some of her experience on Broadway .
Unfortunalety , organising this kind of events is costly and the money from membership fees is not enough .
We also believe the college benefits from our Club .
Being founded in 1920 by our well - known alimni , John Carter , the English Language Club is the oldest club in our college .
The fact that everyone from the community cand participate at our events is helping us to develop a positive relation between the college and the community .
We hope you will be ablte to take all thisinto account and will find it possible to help us continue and improve our club by funding us .
Especially , when it comes to go shopping .
Shopping centres are located in the city centres , so every road trip lasts ages ( I live in a suburb ) . Thusly , when I get to the mall , I am already bent out of shape .
Afterwards the crowd of people is ramming me , when I 'm trying to walk .
The lightning in shops is obnoxious .
I 'm not able to find any nice gears .
At the end I 'm livid and exhausted .
The way Easter and specifically Good Friday is celebrated is gradually deprived of religious content .
People do n't want to to contemplate Christ 's suffering , but they want to move directly to the cheerful part of Easter celebration , so to Easter Sunday .
Suffering as well as death is pushed away from our real life - we do n't want to experience them but rather watch it on different kinds of TV shows .
3 . L'Oreal slogan " Because you 're worth it " proves the author 's thinking that we are unwilling to sacrifice ourselves .
In a consumptive lifestyle we want more and more for ourselves , but not for other people , because it will require self - sacrifice .
It was a hot summer day , everyone was walking to their usual destination ; work , school , buy some groceries , pick up the laundry or their clothes at the cleanners , everyone except Peter .
He was sweating , looking at people in a confusing way .
Suddenly , Peter started to run , while he ran , he looked at his watch , over and over again as if by looking at his watch time would stop .
But this was not the case , time continued to pass by , ever so slowly , making Peter even more nervous .
He stopped at a great big building knowing that the fastest way to get to the top floor of the building was by taking the elevator , but what if the elevator stopped ?
He decided to take the stairs and so he did .
Peter smiled for a brief moment as he remembered his obsession with Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity , he thought " finally I understand it " .
It is clear that most of them use computers and watch television almost every day , but while they are doing this they are sitting in a comfortable sofa .
I feel very strongly that computer games could be an enjoyable way to do physical exercise without going out of home .
In the market , you can find a wide range of computer games or video games to keep fit , such as dancing to the rhythm of last hits , playing tennis , doing aerobics , running ...
It is true that many young people do extra activities related to sports like football or basketball .
Although some schools offer the chance of doing these , many others do not do .
To sum up , it is important motivating the young people to do physical exercise .
It seems to me that school programmes would make young people be encouraged to keep fit because in this way , they do their favourite sport in a routine way .
It all started with jumping over the big black trashcans .
Back in the time , when I successfully passed the third grade , my parents decided to let me pick the present that I want as a reward .
The very first thing came to my mind was a pair of inline roller skates ; I used to look out of my window , or sitting on my house 's door step and see my neighbors skating and trying to do some tricks and jumps , and all I wanted was joining them instead of watching them enjoying their times .
I ran to the outdoor toys section and I picked the skate I liked .
I tried couple of sizes to see which one fits more .
I could not be more excited to join my friends .
By the time , I got better , and I started to learn how to do tricks and jump over small items .
While skating was a whim for my friends and me in the beginning , I found myself in it .
I knew that skating is the thing I want to do for the rest of my life , the thing I want to tell people about when they ask me what your favorite thing to do is .
In a couple of years , I became much better and I learned to do many tricks like skating backwards , the Snake and the Zigzag .
I learned how to jump over many items , such as chairs and the trashcans that my neighbors used to jump over .
I kept trying to know more about skating .
I entered middle school ; I met two friends who also love to skate , Mohammed and Khalid .
We decided to go skating on the next weekend at the park , which has a wide walk path by the sea .
When we met on the weekend , I noticed that they were different ; they have different skates , and different methods of skating , they slid on edges and skated on the park benches .
I realized that this is what I am looking for , a new additional excitement to add to skating .
I had to wait for two months to buy a new pair of skates , but this time it is aggressive skates .
Once on a weekend , it was my last year in middle school , I was at the park practicing as usual .
I introduced myself , and as I thought , they were vising from a different city .
The more we get deep into the conversation , the more I want to learn this type of skating .
They showed me what slalom skating is .
They started to put small cones in one line with a bit of space in between .
They played some music and started to skate with the rhythm . I was surprised , I had mixed feeling , and it was indescribable .
I kept staring at them with wide opened mouth and eyes .
I knew at that moment that I want to change my style of skating .
However , as the skaters suggested , I bought a pair of hockey skates .
I did not have the ability to order the cones online back then , therefore , I went to IKEA , and bought small colored cups and used it as cones .
After couple of hours of trying to get used to my new skates , I put the cups on .
After almost 3 years of practicing to do tricks , to create a perfect match between my moves and the rhythm of the song I am playing , and to try to reach the perfection , I realized that slalom skating is more like a performing art than a sport .
Unlike weather in my country , Philadelphia is always rainy , wet , and sloppy .
This weather was an obstacle , it was impossible to skate in this condition .
However , I was not going to give up on skating that easy .
A friend suggested giving ice skating a shot , and for me , everything worth trying just to be able to skate again .
What I learned in 10 years , I had the ability to learn it on ice in one month .
Today , After 10 years of skating , I wonder sometimes what my life would be without skating . I believe that skating is a huge part of me , Mohammed , and I am positive that if this part was missing , my path in life would have changed and I will never be the same person I am now .
Singapore could be the place that you would find everything you are looking for .
This place is a hub where east and west meet , it has been one of the biggest and busiest port in the world .
If you are looking for any luxury brands and extravaganza shopping experience , this is the right place .
Vivo city in Harbourfront and shopping street on Orchard road are good she you want to buy anything from mid - range to the high - end goods .
Both places are extremely crowded with people on the weekend , unless you enjoy people watching , early bird shopping is highly recommended .
Haji lane in Bugis has lots of local boutiques , you can find unique pieces from designers from Asia .
Graffiti on the wall and small lane ways create a punky ambient .
Lastly there are sports dedicated malls , which are velocity in Novena , Kallang mall and Queensway mall .
I 'm , usually , not good at talking or any social things .
I love to listen him talking - I love his voice .
I ca n't suffer even a second 's moment of our awkward silences .
I 'm kind of person who used to think that every hour had a purpose , who had no time to waste , not even a single hour .
I was always having things to do .
He is the most important to me .
Advertising is most commonly aimed at the manipulation consumer 's behavior in a commercial aspect .
But at the same time advertising has many features in common with art .
Like art it is intended to evoke emotions and feelings .
To be successful advertising often uses images from popular movies , catchy melodies , unusual graphic elements and fragments of famous paintings .
Often people , who are watching a commercial , do not remember what details or elements of other visual art types they have seen before .
Secondly , art as well as advertising is such a large part of our everyday lives .
Someone designed all things around : a chair , shoes , clothes .
Visual advertising like painting uses color , value , space and line .
There are elements of art .
Also it uses balance , contrast , emphasis and proportion .
There are principles of design .
Lastly , advertising like art originated a long time ago .
With the development of mass media , television and Internet advertising has become the strongest form of communication .
Now advertising is a big part of modern culture .
Advertising has similarities with the art and often combines other types of art to be more successful .
Modern technologies , the development of mass media are allowed advertising to become the greatest art from the 20th century .
Michael got out of bed on the wrong side that day or , at least , that 's what he thought when , on his way to work , he was so concentrated looking down at his mobile phone that he did n't see a woman approaching him and they both collided .
On her left hand there was a large steaming cup of coffee that landed on Michael 's new shirt when he bumpped into her .
One second later , Michael was covered in coffee , burnt and sticky and his mobile phone screen was twinking until it finally turned off with a dying flash .
He screamed , shouted , waved his hands into the air , swore and insulted that stranger until his rage faded away .
In this article a teacher refltcts on his experiences of creating plays and using them to help motivate students to develop their English .
It consists of eight part : Introduction ; How to start ; Writing the play ; I want to be Cinderella ; Practise ; The big night ; Reason for doing a play and A few final thoughts .
The author says that the pros far outweigh the cons and it is the main idea of the article .
Writing the play : first , you may ask learners to invent profiles and to tell you about their characters ; second , learners can write the basic outline of the play or you can adapt a familiar story .
They you should take a decision of choosing roles : start by asking for volunteers ; and always ensure that everyone in the class has a role or something to do .
The most effecnive way is to practise every lesson for ten minutes at the beginning and end .
Some learners will not want a spiaking part , you can even ask them to be promters .
Reasons for doing a play : learners will learn whole chunks of language in a clear context and they will learn not only their parts .
It gives learners the opportunity to demonstrate different their skills at the language classroom .
Also they can see how much language they can produse .
In a world of increasing environmental awareness improved public transport represents the way of the future .
Although people do enjoy the convenience and privacy of travelling in their own private vehicles , in my opinion they may choose public transport if it fulfils certain conditions .
For example , if people know that by using bus and subway , they can save enough money to take a free holiday each year , many more individuals would be persuaded to travel in this way .
Regarding my academic experience , I am currently completing my degreee in Primary Teaching and Psycology at the University of Valencia , Spain , where my current speciality is in misbehavioral children .
So far , I have recieved excellent grades in all sabjuects , and I am on course to graduate with distinction at the end of the semester .
Encoled you will find photocopies of all relevant certificates .
I believe my greatest strengths lie in my ability to work well and an aptitude for taking on whatever challenges that come my way .
My future career in teaching would be greatly enhance by earning a degree at your university .
Furthermore , it is better for the planet to ride a bike instead of a car because cycling does n't produce any pollution .
When you start riding a bicycle , you first need to check if your bike follows the security instructions .
You also need to know some basic rules such as putting out your arm to indicate when you turn and of course , you need to know the highway code .
Indeed , some places still need to improve the structures for bikes : sometimes they do n't have a lot of bicycle paths .
But if you learn how to obtrude in the circulation while remaining polite with the others , there is no reason to be afraid .
How are things ? I get your message last week .
First of all , I met many people from all over the world . I keep in touch with them all the time .
during the concert I was responsible for checking tickets .
I was working with two people and we were to check two thousand tickets !
We were cleaning over 8 hours !
It was fantastic to take a part in that enterprise .
She swiftly came beside my bed and gave me a letter .
It was from the most dangerous and terrifyng gang of the village .
I met those boys next Friday and they told me that I had to pass the test initiation .
I went into the tiny shop and the shop keeper looked through me .
The shop keeper nodded and pointed at a grey fridge at the end of the shop .
" Thank you " , I mumbled and went straight to the fridge .
My hands were sweating and the other boys were waiting outside ecstatic .
A second later a child entered the shop and began to move around quickly .
I thought it was the perfect moment and at the speed of light I put a whole box of sweets into my old bag .
I walked forwards and stared at the shop keeper .
I was going to leave when the bitter and loud voice of the man surprised me .
" I do n't know " , he answered confused .
" Dear me ! How can you be so cheeky ? " he uttered dismissively taping his feet .
The boy began to mourn .
After watching this , I returned to my house hoping the man forgives the child .
That was the first crime I comited and here I am now , in jail .
This text lead us into the ( for me unknown ) world of horse racing .
In a few sentences we can get an idea of what it is .
And we can find different reasons to be interested in this type of events .
If you like animals you 'll ejoy seeing that beautiful horses running and vaulting as fast as they can .
If you like to bet and you 're not used to doing at horse races , maybe you 're looking forward to trying to bet on the nose or each way .
And if you love fashion and you have the chance to go to Ascot , you may run into the Queen and greet her , and at the same time enjoy the fabulous view of all those extravagant hats the ladies wear .
Meanwhile you can have a good time drinking some bubbly .
And of course , if you 're not an it - girl , you can spend a lot of money and choose a wrong dress to attend Ascot and perhaps you 'll have to view the races from behind a curtain .
Anyway , if you knew beforehand your odds of winning it would n't be so thrilling .
And if you want to admire the wonderful world of hats , you 'd better buy some magazine where you 'll find all the photos for just 2 €
thanks for the letter which has just arrived . I 've read that you 're writing a term paper on the chances of developing counties to profit from the electronic revolution , are you ?
Because two days ago I 've read an article , by Nadine Bös , about this topic .
The text was about the possibility to transfer money with mobile phones in developing countries .
At first you have to know that the technical term for this is " mobile banking " .
Today it is fact that there is a target group for mobile banking : people who are living in remote areas of the world .
On the one hand there are hardly any banks in these regions , so they do n't have access to bank services .
But on the other hand the number of mobile phones has risen .
So now the most important factor is that mobile nets are reaching the remotest areas in the world .
Through this many people would have access to mobile banking and in addition to that it makes money available so it can be used in shops .
According to Hannah Dideck the largest potential is that migrants con use mobile banking to send money home .
I hope I could help you with this information .
This aspect has also enabled employees to become homeworkers as they do not longer need to be present in an office to get a job done .
Furthermore mobile phones allow last - minute - changes very easily .
However , the biggest strength of the mobile phone is also the biggest risk in my opinion : being connected all the time creates a lot of stress for people , as you are always available for everyone .
Therefore you do n't have any time to relax , which is essential , even from your leisure duties .
The same is valid for business life : if employees are available all the time , they take the worries of the daily business with them to their home which means a lot of stress .
However , I personally think that it should not be regarded too critically but should only be handled responsably , according to one 's personal needs .
Before the trip started , the company who decided to make this trip said that everything was perfectly calculated so that it was imposible to have any kind of problem with the spacecraft .
The first 30 years all was going good , but suddenly something bad happened .
One of the cabins broke down and the person who was inside it waked up .
These guy was called Mark and he was engineer .
Once he realized that he was the only person awake he knew something was wrong ..
The first 2 years all was perfect until the day number 734 .
Since then , they never spoke again .
It was such a hot summer that it was impossible to turn off the ventilator and I was a bored child with a laptop . I had signed in on the social network Tuenti and I liked passing all the time chatting .
She picked me up to her house .
Louis was convinced that this new project will be an incredible opportunity for him to try new things and study different fields , which he enjoyed , he loved to read about science , inventions , and stay up to date with the news .
But he immediately thought - why not continue doing what I love while I do something new?-
That 's exactly what he began doing .
He send an e - mail to the tour company explaining his situation and sudden interest in this project .
The company immediately replied telling him that they were sorry if they did n't reply days earlier , but they could n't since the system crashed and did n't allow them to send electronic mail , just to receive .
They told that it was alright if he was interested in other projects , but he still needed to give the same working performance .
They asked him about this project and what was his idea .
He did trust the company , but not that much for them to know everything he thought .
The company told Louis that they did n't want to bother him , but that they were interested in investing in this kind of projects , because it was related to the purpose of the company : exploring .
But Louis knew that the invention needed to have a great design that implemented portability , that is why he needed to refine his ideas for this project to be used in an immense type of useful ways .
The company told Louis that they wanted to compromise in this project and help Louis .
Later , that same day , Louis went cave diving in the mainland .
He wanted to conquest as much territory down the sea level as he could .
He loved the idea to descend to the bottom of the sea where his ideas would n't be taken away or heard .
When he was exploring the bottom of the sea he tried to grab a rock , but just when he touched it scattered into dust , which vanished in the bulk quantity of water around him , that 's when he knew the next important thing that the invention needed to have : resistance .
Although it also needed to be flexible it needed to be tough .
If not , the consumers of this product will end buried .
What happens to the rubbish
Although citizens usually obey those rules , in some cases they are completely neglected .
However , people who have bigger houses tend to compost the organic waste and that makes up for the disobedient .
The situation with household litter looks much better rather than what happens on the streets of the city .
Authorities make sure that rubbish bins are placed in small distances since this is the most common reason why people throw litter on the ground .
Not also does it give job to people , but also has a good impact on the town 's scenery .
Although there are many people who suggest that public transport is no longer a suitable option because cars are considered a more convenient option to transport , there are more benefits using public transport than travelling by car , such as reduction of traffic , saving money , and decreasing of pollution .
Firstly , a car could carry only 5 people at a time .
A bus or an underground wagon can carry from 30 to 100 people at a time .
The less we use cars , the less traffic we shall see in the roads .
Secondly , having a car implies different costs to be afforded .
If a person constantly uses his / her car , he / she shall need to pay for more petrol .
Equally important , a car requires maintenance and it shall be another expense that the owner has to cover .
Finally , if every person drives his / her own car , pollution shall considerably increase affecting air conditions .
I had to stand because we were shifting our house and had just sold almost all of our furniture on OLX .
My mother said that it would be rude to go at that time .
When I opened my eyes I saw a beautiful chair with orange and green stripes .
Suddenly the chair jerked up and went straight out of the window while I was still sitting on it .
It swerved beautifully avoiding a tree and landed on the ground as softly as a butterfly .
Taking a year off might help people who are uncertain about what to do next to make up their minds , while trying new things and making new experiences that will be useful later on their lives .
It would certainly be counterproductive and a waste of time if the time would be spent doing nothing and just passing the time like it were a long vacation , but if it is used to make new experiences , a year off can change the future of a person .
It can be a great opportunity to travel , meet new cultures and people , or it can be a chance to work to save up money for being able to afford the cost of the university planned on attending .
Or maybe during the year off somebody could also decide that they do n't want to continue their studies , because they already found what they want to do or be .
Sale promotion , which is the set of marketing activities undertaken to boost sales of the product or service , has become a vital tool for marketing and its importance has been increasing significantly over the years .
In spite of some controversies , sales promotion has already demonstrated a mass of positive impact on both sellers and buyers .
The aim of this presentation will be to analyse the aims and approaches of sales promotion as well as to evaluate both benefits and drawbacks sales promotions provide .
Then the presentation will focus on a specific case study------the utilization of Flybuys loyal reward program .

With any new course , there are some certain expectations one will have .
At the beginning of this course , as a first year postgraduate student , I was ambitious for creating a new mechanical product or at least part of it at the end of this course by applying knowledge and skills that are provided throughout the course .
Before taking part in this course , my concept about mechanical design was about applying either self knowledge or working as a part of a team to design mechanical products that are easy to be manufactured , durable and financial reliable .
My thoughts about mechanical design were somewhat match with the information that is provided in the first three weeks .
By attending the first three lectures , I soon realized that my general concept about mechanical design is quite simple as my thoughts about mechanical design is purely just creating new products .
It can be seen in many aspects ranging from producing a maintenance process , improving performance for a specific part of the mechanical system to creating the whole new product .
This is because despite having experience in industrial design , I was never taking part in the design process from the initial stage .
Therefore , my knowledge about mechanical design is rather limited .
Being placed in a project team working for Sydney Water about producing a maintenance excellent standard , I started to read the course outline and lecture notes more carefully to find out where to start and what I should do to deliver a good outcome .
The first thing I have noticed is the importance of clarifying all the requirements with the clients .
This was demonstrated during the Project Introductions session as well as lecture notes , client interview task and client feedback ( which is worth 25 points in the total mark ) .
As soon as I met my group , I discovered how far behind I am in terms of using English to demonstrate the ideas and lure the attention from other group members .
However , this also is an opportunity to meet up and work with them every week , whose English is their first language , to improve my oral communication skills and persuasion .
The final consideration is the self - calibration , which also is the point that I have never considered before in a design process .
To sum up , at the end of week three , my expectation for this course are to be able to apply my reflective thinking in any further design process , to be able to deliver a persuasive technical presentation , to be effective in verbal communication skills and presentation skill .

In today 's world , due to the fact the great comfort of cars , public transport is likely to disappear .
Firstly , is it true that cars are the faster way of transport .
In addition the car is one of the means most used not only its quickness but also because the cost of public transport is increasing every year .
From my point of view , many people use cars owe to the awful quality of some buses , trains …
We should also consider the fact that nowadays life is so busy that we ca n't waste our time taking public transport .
However , cars can cause some problems like traffic jams and accidents that could be avoided using public transport .
To conclude , it seems to me that it is fine to use cars sometimes but whether the quality of public transport was better , the amount of pollution and accidents would decrease .
In recent years , many regions of the world have faced an issue about water scarcity that may affect their development , especially for those countries undergoing poverty .
This essay will analyse the problem of water scarcity in Australia and recommend some viable alleviation solutions .
It will examine responses including the recycling water , the development of technology about purifying ocean water and multinational sharing about water resources .
Recycling wastewater is an effective method to solve water scarcity problem .
This is because there is a huge number of water usage presenting in people 's daily life , they just need to be collected to filter waste parts .
However , the use of recycled water for daily routine is less common , because many people are repelled by the thought of water that comes from our toilets or drains .
For example , those recycled water can be utilized to water plants in a garden , but if they are clear enough , residents only need to heat them to wash dishes or even drink .
Thus , states should make it possible to purify the wastewater to an enough safety level .
Moreover , developing latest technology about purifying ocean water can be regarded as a viable alleviation strategy .
As is well known , about 70 per cent surface of earth is covered by ocean water , so every region surrounded by ocean like Australia makes the most of ocean water resource to release the pressure of fresh water need .
Although , governments are likely to face economic stress initially , which means they have to invest more money into upgrade technology instead of other field such as education , infrastructure and medical care , this strategy could affect dwellers ' physical health and promote their living standard .
In this way , those states of drought regions will obtain enough time and technical aid to overcome water problems .
Despite over shared water resources could lead to violence and even international tension , few countries suffered these problems .
In conclusion , water shortage has presented a challenge to individual life and global environment .
While these approaches are likely to solve the problem partially , they might have a positive impact on water shortage in a long term .
You may not have never thought about it but you ///would///could///might/// be able to jump from a plane if you wanted .
If you ask me why I enjoy my favourite sport so much , I would n't hesitateto answer .
First of all , the best thing about skydiving is the excitement and the discharge of adrenalin .
When you are sitting on the plane next to your instructor , with your legs hunging and your arms crossed … It makes an indescribable impression on you .
Finally , you are around 4000 meters high and after 60 seconds of free fall at 200 km / hour , your parachute is opened and you are flying about 5 minutes until you land on the floor .
As you can imagine , there are some advices that you should do///know if you want to take it up .
I 'm sure you will agree that it can be one of your best experiences if you pay attention to your instructor all the time .
Plus , you should wear a sweater or jacket to avoid to be cold /// being cold because you are flying on the sky , over the clouds .
And obviously , you should n't be afraid of hights to enjoy skydiving fully .
Facial expression is said to be more important for the film actors , whereas body language and voice intonation are paid more attention to in the stage acting .
Besides , camera work , props and special effects deserve to be called silver screen features , while staging implies actors to convey their play through body movements and energy .
It is evidently that those types of acting are different and the actors should adapt to the conditions they work in in one way or another .
But let 's take a closer look at what performance capabilities they have and might use during the acting .
The stage actor is armed with props , costumes and light as well as the film actor .
So I would say those types of acting are even in the sense of external factors .
Regarding acting techniques , stage actors do use their body languages as much as film actors .
The only thing that differs is that film actor has several takes opposed to stage actor who has to play perfectly at one dash .
And controlling your voice is also important for the film actors , in spite of having the support of audio operators , they still have to deal with the same problems as stage actors that is keeping your voice expressions in compliance with the acting , resonate moving , communicate emotions and feelings of their model character .
The key point is that the whole range of techniques makes that acting pieces perfect .
I would say , it does n't matter are you performing on the stage or in front of the camera , you should use your facial expression , body language , intonation and timber of voice as if you 're acting as your main character , embody all their treats and features appropriately to the situation .
Furthermore people actively use private transport such as cars , motorbikes , scooters and bicycles .
Tourists can encounter with difficulties such as a traffic jam .
Sometimes it is very difficult to come home in rush hour because of traffic jams .
There are some disadvantages of banning cars .
This idea also would be unpopular because it limits a freedom of choice .
In my view the best solution to all problems would be limitation of private transport in the centre but not absolute banning .
Firstly , the article ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ' shows a new research , in which it 's possible to pick up some of the signs of dyslexia in the brain even before kids learn how to read .
In addition , using this identification may assist parents , educators and clinicians to tackle the learning disorder .
Secondly , the article ' ' Innovative ' Intervention Helps Babies at High Risk of Autism ' is based on a video - therapy , which improves the interaction between parents and autism - related babies in a way that would help develop the children 's communication abilities and social engagement .
All in all , if you want to read about an effective research with very strong proposals , I recommend reading ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ' .
Tom has joined a volunteering team at St. Michael 's Hospital and this was his first day .
He will deal with temporarily disabled people who come for a rehabilitation session every other day .
Tom 's role was to conduct a focus group once per week to explore the people 's experience and perception about their illness and the service given to them at the rehabilitation center .
The ultimate aim is to get a feedback for service - improvement purpose .
Tom has prepared a set of questions to ask .
He then introduced himself and made a clear statement about the objective of the focus group and assured them that their identity will not be revealed .
We all know the situation , when we are in supermarket standing in front of two products which are the same , but one of it costs much more than the other .
Here we have brand products and no name products .
Now the question is , if it is really justified that brand products are much more expensive than no name products .
Most people associate brand products automatically with higher quality or better taste , while they think no name products are just cheap and without any quality and a bad taste .
In surveys , it was asked if consumers would rather buy brand products or no name products .
Most of the consumers said , they would buy brand products .
After that the consumers made a blind taste test .
The product without brand tasted better to nearly everybody .
As a result you can say it is not always justified that brand products are more expensive than comparable other ones .
Only the brand and the good marketing makes it that expensive , not better quality or better taste .
The effect of media on people is clearly noticeable here .
It is like " Everybody has it , I need it too ! "
In some cases it may be true that brand products are better than no names , for example technology products , but products like Red Bull or others like that , are definitely not always better .
Here it is said , try and find out which is really the better one and do not trust on advertisements .
We had won three free plane tickets to Rome in a competition , and we were looking forward to our trip for months .
The passport was ready in an hour , so we were hurrying to the gate and got on the plane .
You do n't have to worry about getting to my house , because it 's really simple , and I 'm helping you making it even more simple by picking you up at the train station of my town .
The underground it 's in the airport and it 's very easy to reach because you just have to follow the signs .
Once you 're in the train station , go where they sell tickets and buy one for Viterbo .
Get the train and jump off at the " Viterbo " stop - I will be right out of the station waiting for you !
In this period it 's mostly sunny and warm , but in the evening it gets a little cold and windy so bring some jumpers or sweaters ...
That 's why I think that waiting in queues is essential at any place .
Otherwise , the place would turn into a mess , especially the crowded places .
It may seems boring and time wasting to wait in queues , but it is n't .
Also , that make them do their jobs efficiently .
In conclusion , people will do what they want smoothly and politely , if they wait patiently in queues .
I 'm Sara and I 'm a half - italian , half - spanish , seventeen years old girl with a really cheerful , energetic and hardworking personality .
I saw this advertisement on a web site and I instantly thought it would be a really great experience for me to improve my English , but also a great way to show how responsible and caring I am .
I love children and it would n't be annoying for me to take care of a group of little monsters and organize sports and activities for them , actually I think I would really enjoy it and my day would end up with a tired smile , but a very bright smile .
I 've never had any experience of this kind before , but I have a brother three years younger than me and a little cousin who 's seven years old with whom I use to play a lot when I do n't have to study .
I 'm constantly brainstorming to find everything that could be challenging for me and I usually try to follow what my mind brings out , so I think I could come up with nice ideas for those children .
I started cooking when I was fourteen years old , but I 'm better at baking , so I could help preparing some sweets for children .
They would obviously be as healthy as possible and I would be really careful about those children who have allergies , and try to bake something that also them can eat .
I speak English quite fluently and I scored 95 points over 100 at both KET and PET certification .
English is also my favorite language since I was a child , I started studying it at the age of three with a really nice teacher named Helen and I continued improving my English watching American movies and TV shows during the past few years .
Best regards .
Firstly I started a new job , it did not turn out they way I hoped unfortunately .
My colleauges are nice but the management are terrible and recently I just stopped talking to them .
Perhaps it is not their fault that this entire operation is so dysfuntional .
While we might talk about our job a bit too much I do n't think it is uncomfortable to work side by side .
I met some roleplayers at Wiscon and also some live roleplayers through Geek Network , of these the live roleplay looks promising .
Lastly I hope next year will bring some stability .
While I do not wish top continue to work and live like this , I am not sure I want to move again .
But I ca n't imagine in can be as bad or worse then my current job .
If I move again I know it would take another year to find other people at least .
I am not sure Vastervik has that kind of clientel .
Michael had always been a good boy : responsible , quiet , always on time and always the first of his class .
He closed the window not to hear the laughs and yells of his friends , playing soccer in the field in front of his house : " I never liked soccer , anyway " he kept telling himself , but the more he tried , the harder it get to focus on his book .
He felt like a character in a cartoon , with an angel on a shoulder and a devil on the other , giving him opposite pieces of advice , and exactly like such a character , he did n't know who to listen to .
Suddenly the doorbell rang , distracting him from his inner struggles , and he heard his Mother opening the door .
He stood up , hesitating for a few seconds , then glanced at his book once again and finally got out of his room and said " Please mom , tell him I ca n't go out , I have to study . "
By a wide definition , teachers are the people who teach you .
If parents want to get these abilities , they need to spend extra time to learn .
Because everyone has their own talents , values , and judgments , we learn more from those with whom we agree and appreciate and get significant influence from them .
These people can be deemed as the best teacher in our life , even if these people perhaps are not our parents .
The reason for my choice is simple and clear : the French revolution was the turning point in the European modern history and , thanks to its achievements , people in the twenty - first century can enjoy civil rights such as freedom of speech , assembly , worship and , the most important one , freedom of thought .
It is difficult to think about Paris without its Eiffel tower ( it was built several years after the revolution ) , but I 'm sure it was a gorgeous city as it is nowadays .
I fancy its streets crowded by workers and peasants that have been called to support the revolution .
They meet at midnight to listen to the speechs of the leaders .
I would do my best for making their imprisonment less hard and , above all , I 'd try to convince the Parliament not to sentence them to the death penalty .
Because no revolution is worthier than a human life .
Thank you very much again for helping me getting the tickets for the concert in London but unfortunately I have bad news for you today .
But only until yesterday ! My professor told us that our final exam in this course would be on July 5th .
As you know I 'm not the best student and I 've already failed in this exam twice , so there is only one more chance and I have to take it this semester .
Otherwise I will be taken off the university register .
To be honest I got really mad at him because I really wanted to go to London and I also already got tickets for my flight .
You do n't know how ashamed I feel now , not only for you because you helped me to get the tickets ( and I can imagine how difficult it must have been ) but also because you have already arranged everything to make my stay in London as comfortable and enjoyable as possible .
Do you maybe have a friend who you would like to go with to the concert since we ca n't go together ?
I would let you the ticket so at least you have the chance to enjoy that event even if it is n't with me .
Otherwise I could sell both tickets and we can have a look if we want to go to the same concert here in Germany .
I have been proving my abilities by overcoming arduous competitions since I chose this career as a lawyer and researcher complying with my passion in persuasion and problem solving .
Throughout my undergraduate studies , my professional skills were recognized at the internships at the Federal Court of Law and the most famous fiscal law office in the State .
At this period , I was the intern coordinator and I created a manual on the procedures employed by the entire Court .
On the other side , in recognition to my academic performance , I graduated with a Bachelor of Laws with Great Honors in 2007 .
I was placed in the top 10 with a GPA of 8.73 out of 10 .
My bachelor thesis , founded in Economic Law , was unanimously awarded by the Jury with the maximum score of 10 .
Since my Law school graduation , many achievements encouraged my professional development .
First , upon graduation , I immediately joined a highly recognized firm , performing a double role of legal consultant and sub - manager , when I was only 22 years old .
On the same year , I succeeded the strenuous Brazilian Bar exam with a remarkable score of 9 out of 10 .
After almost 2 years working in complex litigation , I had acquired the maturity to pursue an international career to work within and cross - border contracts .
Therefore , in order to acquire the excellence extent demanded , I specialized in Economic law with a master 's degree at the University Paris 1 Panthéon - Sorbonne in 2009 .
Following my LLM graduation with magna cum laude in the top five , I enrolled in a PhD in International Economic Law at the University Paris 9 Dauphine in 2010 .
Due to my interest in law and economics , I developed a multidisciplinary research applying the economic analysis in contemplation of illustrating the mutual influence of rules and economic transactions on the legal certainty of transnational transactions .
I profoundly comprehend the theoretical ascertainment for this career , which is that international trade requires rational economic decisions with legally binding consequences .
In conclusion , as an international legal professional , I must be prepared for alternative methods of dispute resolution regarding cross - border transactions , giving the increasingly requirement to look beyond domestic law to find appropriate solutions .
Furthermore , I already profoundly understand the importance of linguistics in an international sphere due to my experience as a foreign lawyer and as a teacher .
The LLM in International Business Regulation , Litigation and Arbitration at New York University is irrefutably the postgraduate program that I need to ensure the outcome aimed .
Man has evolved over the years , since the invention of the wheel , to space craft expeditions .
Our specie has achieved great things , but despite all the great discoveries , there is still one problem we have not been able to suppress , a problem that has been haunting us since unmemorable times : racism .
In the 19th century , slavery had been eradicated from America , but soon another problem originated and took its place .
The movie " The Color Purple " displays a variety of situations from Afro - American people who suffered because of their skin color , known as racism , which can be defined as the prejudice or discrimination from one race to another .
In this period of time , the Caucasian race felt superior to the Afro - Americans , they had the control and they were in charge of the political and economic activity , while the Afro- Americans did the hard work ; as shown in the movie , most of the men where in charge of the crops .
They did not have a chance to receive any kind of education at all , it was absolutely forbidden , and that is why they could not aspire to more important jobs .
Afro - Americans were completely segregated , Caucasians found it impossible to live among them , that is the main reason why each race had their own church and their houses where separated to .
Afro - Americans were afraid of raising their voices to express their inconformity against the oppression they were suffering , and to fight to obtain equality was not an option because any sign of rebellion was cruelly punished .
Moreover , women in the Afro - American society where threatened in the most denigrating ways , men were the undisputed authority in the house .
It makes me feel sad to realize that racism is still a problem from which society suffers . I wonder , Why do we have the necessity of feeling superior to other people ?
We are all equal to God 's eyes , and I believe we all have the same right of living a peaceful life based on mutual respect .
It had been a long and rainy day ; Tom had been working all day and was very tired and hungry .
As usual , he decided to sit on the bar and order some fish and chips .
Surprised he thought he had n't seen her for a long time .
As they talked they came to realize that they had been working at offices which were very near for almost a year .
First of all , our environment is polluted and if we are determined to save it we should definitely stop using cars .
Although there are many other polluters , such as big industries , people should start with the easiest resolutions .
Although many countries do not offer a good public transport service , once people get rid of cars there will be more money for the improvements .
For instance , Copenhagen and Vienna are good examples for this .
It seems like cars are losing the battle in this case because these cities propagate the idea that riding bicycles can lead to better future .
Unfortunately , not many people are prepared to renounce all the advantages car provides .
For example , it is claimed that it is more convenient to travel by car than bus because you can make breaks whenever you want to and they are more spacious .
It is a fight for the better and healthier future .
Dear college
About the task that you ask me to do , unfortunately I do n't have enough knowledge about LIMS yet .
I understand that the new programme have some specific requisites related to preservation of analysed samples .
Nevertheless , all the information that I send to you is based on the information that my colleagues from wet chemistry laboratory and from microbiology laboratory gave to me .
Of course that if you have any suggestions please tell me .
I will transmit it to them and we will discuss them .
Suppose that we have a stock failure resulting from an increasing demand of a particular analysis .
International suppliers take , at least a week to deliver an order .
It was a cold winter night and the moon was fighting the clouds for freedom , much like any of us fighting through our life and it 's obstacles .
Michael however , made a living off his fights , at a young age Michael was attacked and mugged in the street so he started taking martial arts lessons lest he be bullied again .
If the demolition crew camp in front of my place again tomorrow I 'll just show them the form ...
" he said taking a pill . "
But then again what good is a useless piece of paper ? " he panicked , putting the box on the night stand he did n't even understand the passing of time !
Until he had calmed enough to go feed his dog , his one best friend , the dog he and his fiance ' bought before it broke off .
The Labrador really took him back to his engagement ...
He was doing well despite his sad life .
His anxiety caught up to him every now and then but the good doctor had prescribed him a good remedy !
Suddenly Michael heard a thud from his upstairs bedroom , Called Baxter and took a bat with him upstairs .
Michael rushed to his bedroom with a fatal mixture of fear and adrenaline in his system , only to see his box of pills on the ground and the sound of muffed but heavy breathing coming from behind the door .
Michael closed the door , saw his dog gasping for air and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
It is well accepted that whenever you become a famous person you lose your privacy .
Whether they like it or not , right from the beginning all you do becomes attractive for the mob : what you eat , where you go , who you date to , your possible marriage , your holidays , etc .
I agree with the fact that as soon as your life is not private anymore , famous people have to face journalists with a smile they do not have .
I mean by this that for sure there are some days in which these famous people are in a bit of a mood , they have to visit the doctor , or they have to solve mishaps with lawyers , and they have stuck those journalist following till the door or awaiting them stationed in front of their houses .
In these cases , jounalists themselves should realize that they are taking it too far and that they should respect them a bit more .
During this period , the town has seen extensive growth in residential areas and local amenities , and a modernisation of leisure faclilities .
Parks in the north - east and south - east have been reduced to make way for larger housing estates the one in the north dramatically increasing accommodation in Eastminister .
south of the river , an industrial area has been constructed next to the existing railway while residential streets have been converted into more modern apartment blocks .
With increasing housing has come a bigger hospital and more shopping facilities the existing shops being built on the site of the old school , with a new school opening on the north bank of the river .
I like the way you gave examples how you felt and how you would change your own lessons .
However , when I was reading your article I felt ashamed due to the fact that when every teacher teaches the way I do it is logical that our students ca n't be quiet and ca n't sit without making a move .
Moreover , when we as teachers have a study day , I get tired myself by sitting all day .
In my opinion I am very patient and willing to explain difficult topics over and over again .
as I see it , it is my job to clarify and help my pupils to understand .
Your experience gave me food for thought especially when you wrote that our pupils are sitting passively and listening during approximately 90 per cent of their classes .
I teach at Basisberoeps level and I have already started to use some activities were they must use an Ipad and make pictures or short films .
However , I find it difficult to use activities every lesson because they are time consuming .
Although the main reason that prevents me from using them are my colleagues .
For instance , when I hear that another English teacher finished Unit 5 and I am still at Unit 4 I feel incompetently .
It gives me the feeling that most important of teaching is doing all the exercises in the book and getting all the work done .
Maybe you understand this discrepancy between activate pupils and the pressure of the school board for the best test results .
She was walikng around the city thinking about the job she just lost .
Yes , she should accept this proposition .
Everything was looking perfect and it was something she enjoyed ndoing before the accident took place .
But then something gone wrong and she just walked away .
He made her feel bad so why would she do n't do the same ?
BUt it was okay .
The dark clouds above the sky , full of life , seemed to mock his little desire to live .
He could heard the thunders shouting with rage , a rage he wished he could feel again .
He stared at an object on the beside table , the object that could free him from this hell like existence .
Could bliss we found in dead ?
Was it the best part life could offer ?
its own end ? .
He placed a hook over the door , tied the object to it and standing on a chair put the object around his neck .
He looked at the clouds , they were still grey , and then for a moment , he saw a tinny fragment of a rainbow .
This is easy word to understand , but it hides more than defination says .
All the people need these things and the best givers are family members because they give unconditionally .
My family members all the time expression their warm feelings with hugs , kisses and beautiful words .
For example my parents hug me every day .
My mother makes me breakfast every morning and my brother brings me cookies , when I have a bad mood .
These small thing gives me a lot .
Also they always support me no matter what I do or think .
Usual friends can often say " no " or let me down , but my family never does that .
My family knows most of my secrets , they know my worries and joys , they know that I am thinking about things .
They fulfill all the functions that my friends has , and they fulfill them even better .
As a result , some sources of energy like nuclear power are used for our daily life .
Fossil fuels are our most common energy source , even though , they produced a terrible effect on global warming on account of releasing gases into the atmosphere .
Just look at oil , nature takes millions of years to form it and we have almost ended it .
Nuclear power plants have a high risk of pollution in case of accident .
In addition , they produce nuclear waste which is a major problem for the environment and public health .
All things considered , I believe that renewable energy will be the most common energy in the future as it does n't damage global warming although it is expensive to afford .
No , it is not rational because according to the economic theory , you should spend your money on those goods which yield the maximum utility per dollar .
If MUx / Px is less than MUy / Py , than it is the consumer 's duty to buy more of good Y. If MUy / Py is less than MUx / Px , than the consumer must use more of good X. When you work more , you can consume more , each additional unit yielding additional , marginal utility , so you continually increase the sum of your total utility .
She may be right about that treadmill because there is a cycle in which consumption results from work which necessitates further consumption , but theory would indicate that this is a positive , self - perpetuating cycle because increased consumption yields increased utility , therefore maximizing utility .
Ms. Luhr 's dissatisfaction from her current status in our society must come from her failure to vary her consumption of a variety of material goods .
In my view Ms. Luhr is succumbing to her emotions rather than her logic because everyone knows that increased work yields increased wealth and increased utility , and this is the ultimate goal of a rational person who is acting selfishly which is how economists think people act .

At the same time he worked for the Pirelli calendar in 1974 he also featured shots that appeared in Elle , Vogue , Numero , etc .
The career of a Somali - American fashion model Iman also began after this pioneering shooting .
These images became the subject of Feurer 's eponymos book , lavishly illustrated with 175 photographs , illustrating his five - decade long career .
Weight lifting is involves the basic and most natural human movements .
Obviously the weight is the resistance , which will help the individual to gain strength and mass .
Every time I go to the gym I feel like I have to breaking my limits and replace them with the feeling of success .
The best advice I can give for a newbie is to do not go the gym at all without knowledge .
Look up on the Internet how to execute the exercises properly .
Eating healthy foods are the other part of that sport .
I rather call that a life style .
Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category .
Conversely , the Bronte sisters are influenced by the preceding Romantic works , and their novels contain Gothic elements such as ghosts and the dark ominous atmosphere .
If their themes are considered , it is immediately clear that Dickens builds an extraordinary image of the Victorian society , with a wide range of characters and stories which reveal the conditions of children and the poor ; instead the Brontes ' novels contain the Byronic hero , a male figure with a dark past who wants to find some revenge , as Heatcliff in " Wuthering Heights " or forgiveness as Mr Rochester in " Jane Eyre " .
PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS FOR OUR ENGLISH COURSE
The aim of this report is to inform the committee about the wishes of the students who took part in the survey that was conducted lst week in our school .
However , there are some defficiencies that could be fixed .
Firstly , there is a great demand among our students of a computer room with broadband Internet connection .
It is well known that this kind of facility help students make the most of their time while learning English .
Not only the bedrooms are rather small , but also are they quite cold , because of the lack of a heating system .
There are also numerous complaints in regards to the quality of the food offered in the canteen .
It will be advisable to change the catering service .
We will be grateful if any of these problems were solved by the committee .
In case you need further information regarding any of these issues , please contact us and I will be glad to respond you as soon as possible .
Maybe if you could just reduce the time you spend with each of your activities , it could work out and you would n't need to drop any of them .
However if you are still very stressed , then you might drop one of them , I certainly do n't know which one you should drop , I think I would drop the music lessons , because sports are good for your physical and mental health , and also help you to be fit and it 's more interesting for me ; but maybe a list with the pros and cons of sports and music lessons can help you .
Start asking yourself Which one do you like the most ?
Environmental problems today are more worrisome , if we not do something for our planet , in a few years we will suffer the consequences .
No time to speculate , it is time to act and implement all these measure we know .
Enough talk , is time to make a decision : we want a better world , or , we want to see it destroyed in a few years .
Simple things like recycling garbage , walking short distances instead of using cars , not throwing garbage on the streets or oceans , can mean a considerable change , because if we add the small efforts of each of us , the results are translated into millions of people .
I recommend implementing a campaign called " No more blah blah blah , it 's time to save the world " , we may not have super powers and not be " Superman , Ironman , Captain America , Batman , etc . " and we save the planet from intergalactic threat but unlike them , all together we can save the planet from an even greater threat , its total destruction due to pollution and environmental problems that we ourselves have caused .
Just as we have the courage to provoke , we have to have the courage to do something to fix , let us become that super hero that changed the world and made a change for future generations to have a healthy environment to live .
Just think about your future and in your family , and when you see rubbish lying in the street , remember that you can become the superhero that someday be satisfied because he did something to save the planet .
It 's time to bring the superhero we have inside ; good luck !
Variety of cafes and clubs would appeal to a great number of foreigners owing to the fast service and the proper attitude to clients .
They would also enjoy our museums and galleries which can bring them closer to our history and traditions .
More students would be attracted when the school government made some changes in the learning system .
I recommend that a more common teaching method should be one - to - one lessons , namely teacher with only one student , as that will contribute to increasing the range of their knowledge and will be also beneficial for students who need more help in a particular subject .
Therefore , it is needed to provide new facilities in the classrooms .
Computer - based learning would be a great idea of attracting more foreign students because that will maximize their technological capabilities , so that more work will be implemented .
Improvemnts on socialising opportunities
The school government should offer more extra - curricular activities , including organising excursions in the local area and giving students a chance to choose the school course which appeals to them the most .
I would recommend implementing all the suggestions listed above because these improvements will increase the number of foreign students making their accommodation in the town more pleasant .
I know plenty of amazing English courses but they all have different prizes .
I 've seen a couple of advertisements on English courses in our town , but they do n't seem very useful .
However , if you want to have a look at them , they are put up on the supermarket .
I 've got a cousin who works as an English teacher and she has an academy right next to the city council .
You can choose the time and the days you will like to go and she has fantastic offers if you do not want to spend a huge amount of money .
I leave you her mobile phone in case you need it : 681234567 .
However much Roman law , Mosaic law , and rabbinical law impacted lives of Jews living in first - century Israel , many people who followed the religion of Israel lived outside of Palestine and beyond the borders of the Roman Empire .
The metaphor is the Bible uses to express this relationship is covenant .
While the metaphor comes from the sphere of international law , it is wrong to understand the commandments merely as a summary of Israel 's obligations toward God . . .
Israel obedience to commandments was not a matter of submission to the divine will as much as it was a response to love
I always go to have a pizza in a restaurant near my house . "
La Terrazza " is the classic Neapolitan restaurant , that makes pizza and all the Neapolitan specialties , as all the type of fried .
It uses only fresh ingredients from naples that come there every day .
The place remembers the atmosphere of the little alleyways of Naples , with pictures of the most famous Neapolitan people on the wall .
You can sit there and wait for your pizza while watching the football match or bring your pizza home .
The owner Patrizio , is really nice and you can often find him out of the restaurant talking to some guest .
I think it could be suitable for my class because it has two halls and one of them is always used for big groups of people , like us , the service is really rapid and in front of the restaurant there 's a beautiful square where we can have a drink while watching the typical Neapolitan evening .
Obviously everyone loves pizza , so it 's the perfect place .
But , in fact , the car provides much better mobility needs , both in the big cities as on the countryside .
Our daily life is thoroughly planned , from the morning to the night .
We must keep doing our day - to - day concerns at work and at home , and , at the same time , keep holding our social life and entertainment activities .
Modern life orders our days and weeks in a packed schedulle of activities : job , children , housework , fun , free time ...
We have to go fast from one place to another , just to be in time for fulfilling next task or activity .
It 's for that we need to improve our mobility skills and private transport , as a car , allows us to achieve more efficiently our goals .
But , on the other hand , travelling by car gives us more comfort and saves time , and it offers a wider range of choices of departure and routes .
Every day the science and the industry are developing new materials , technologies and clean energy sources .
As industrial and technological development progresses , public transport will lose passengers and the use of private cars will spread anywhere around the world .
only then can you really start to speak .
When you are on holiday , try to make contact with other English - speakers , and who knows ?
i find watching TV programmes in English and reading increase my exposure to new words , and help me recycle words I know in new contexts .
This is a very common argument : the true genius stands out so much that can not be misunderstood , so if he is not recognized then he is not a genius .
But this is faulty reasoning : it accept the idea that a genius is always recognized on the basis that in history geniuses have always been recognized - which is not true , or at least is not demonstrable .
They take for granted that historically geniuses have always been recognized , but in reality they are only talking about geniuses that , in fact , have been recognized .
They know nothing of those who have not been recognized and that may have been completely erased from history , and therefore can not be used as an opposite example .
In the 19th century for some , such as Cesare Lombroso , geniality resembles mental illness .
For Lombroso exceptional people are independent , away from the banality of life , isolated , impatient , asocial , often considered crazy .
The time in the university is the most important time in our lives because , we learn lot of things and it prepares us for our future career .
Some may think that it is better to have classes with discussion of professor and student .Others may disagree .
They prefer classes with lecture and almost no discussion .
In my opinion classes with discussion are better .
First , classes with discussion between professor and student had an advantage for the student because they learn how to interact with their fellow student .
Doubtlessly , such interactions with other people will help you to broaden your mind and learn new things .
For instance , a year back I was in north Texas university in USA , there was a health management and policy class with almost no lecture but with lot of time for open discussions .
In the beginning , I thought this was disadvantage but this was not true .
On one day we spoke about medical treatment cost in different country and one of my friend , Wole was from Nigeria .
Consequently , he was able to tell us how the cost of the treatment are less , how doctors are dedicated , and how everybody has access to primary health care .
As a result we all know what to be done so that we can make little changes in the reform to lessen the cost of the treatment .
As you can see , open discussion in the class are really important since they broaden your horizon and help you to understand different nation 's policies .
Second , open discussion in the class help you to develop certain skills in order to become an independent thinker and speaker .
In order to get good grades we are forced to participate in discussion .
As a result I overcome my anxiety and started speaking in front of those students and I found its not difficult as I expected .
This experience taught me that it is better ti participate in a class with open discussion because it provide you with speaking and thinking abilities which are imperative for your career .
All in all though some may oppose my opinion , it is clear that classes with open discussion and almost no lecture are preferable because interaction with other student will broaden your mind and you become a better speaker and thinker .
with reference to your job announcement I am submitting my application for the vacancy at Green Pepper Cafe .
Being a student of economics in this town ( expecting to graduate next year ) I am currently searching for a job at weekends .
Your job description sounds to be a good fit for my search since I am well experienced in serving guests and have a good knowledge of various kinds of foods .
My tasks included back office administration and services in the hotel 's restaurant .
Being ranked in the Michelin 's guide , this restaurant provides more than 50 different dishes .
I love to serving customers and to dealing with different and complex situations .
Should you require further information , I will be happy to provide them .
I hope you 're ok , by the way .
It 's an excellent idea , of course we should go , I bet there are lots of things to do so we can have a great time .
Well , all your suggestions sound good to me , however , I would probably choose climbing because not only is it an extreme sport but it is also an exciting activity I would like to try .
About Saturday evening , why do n't we just stay at home and watch some One Direction videos ?
I do n't know if my parents will be here on Friday , I 'm afraid not , they 've been working so much !
He stared at the clock hanging in the wall and frowned .
It was late , and there was a lot of work to do , so he 'd better catch up .
By the time he arrived at the rivershore , some of his colleagues were already digging the ditch .
The river was flowing down with great noise , and its level was slowly rising up , as it had been happening for the last few days .
The crops might be flooded very soon if they did n't do anything to avoid it .
They worked all day long , restlessly , until they were breathless and their hands were bleeding .
He gazed at it , a bit worried about the possibility of more raining during the night , but proud of having put the farm in shelter .
We human beings are highly socialized creature in the world .
Therefore , it is inevitable that we have to learn to be part of the society .
However , considering the complexity of the society , I believe it better to learn in schools rather than from parents .
First of all , there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental living skills , on which their progeny count .
For example , one of my senior high school 's classmate had encountered communication problem involved in the other 's family .
As a consequence , they never talk to each other since then .
Following the previous paragraph , there will always be people of different living styles , attitudes , and beliefs in every aspect of one 's life .
Have we not lived and learned the skills in a group , especially in school , we will not be skilled before entering the society .
The society as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turn continuously influence every member .
In contrast , living in a society is another story : people might blame , compete , or even hurt others no matter who you are .
Learning in schools , however , provides valuable opportunity for children to learn not only from teachers , but also from relationships between peers , and as a result , proves the way for being independent in the future .
In a nutshell , there is a great deal of knowledge needs to be gained for children in order to live in a society .
School , a place with diverse students along with their attitudes towards lives , might be better than learning merely with the parents .
Although it 's true that I do n't actually love sports , once I found golf it totally engaged me !
By playing golf you can enjoy a wonderful journey in touch with the nature and even with some friends , while you do some healthy , constant and not too tiring exercise !
If you like the great views from a high hill , as well as having a relaxing time with yourself or sharing it with other people , golf is the perfect sport for you .
The only disadvantage I could find is that golf is n't such a cheap sport to do , as it requires a lot of expense and also a good mental and psychological health , which is the first thing I recommend to work on if you want to enjoy golf from the beginning .
I totally encourage you to try it at least once and I 'm sure you will desire to repeat !
It slowly rustles and clatters and it 's pulsing waves attract so much that you ca n't stand sitting still much longer and you are ready to throw up everything and run towards it .
Long before our journey I knew that I would love this country , I would fall in love with ocean and sea once for all .
I was wrong only about one thing : I had loved it long ago .
I had been adoring the sea and dreaming about it when I had never seen it before , never heard it before , but definitely felt it not by skin but my heart .
The main advantage of it is that the ocean is always near at hand , no matter in what part of the town you are .
Like in all the seaside towns , it 's always windy there .
So , that 's why I gave up the idea to do it and decided to be a shaggy - girl= )
Also I remember sweat perfume of Spaniards ( and Spain itself ) , spreading through the streets of old town and mixing with the smell of fried fish that is ready to be served in numerous bars , cafes and restaurants .
I remember the warmth of twilight wnich lures you to the heart of this town .
I remember the laugh of people , sitting at the tables and chatting .
I remember children , running about the small squares in fronf of the cathedrals ; elderly people in wheelchairs ...
All these memories are always with me , and to go through them again I do n't even need to close my eyes , everything in my mind heart is too vivid to forget .
A language it is the capital thing to learn because it is the way people communicate and organize their thoughts .
Furthermore , it gives you the chance to enjoy the works done in that language .
Nevertheless , when you are learning a language , it brings confussion .
On the one hand the old one could be hard wired into your brain .
It also has another negative effect , you have limited time on this planet .
There are an incredible amount of things to learn .
Why would you waste your time learning a new language , when you probably do not know enough about your own .
But , as a learner of my third language , I am a firm believer it is the right choice .
We are delighted to inform you that charity dinner was a success .

We would like to say thank you for your presence in the event , we are delighted because you chose to promote our educational program , we are pretty sure that your presence helped a lot to promote this program with the new students .
No change , no life . Nature is life and death , construction and destruction .
No change , no Nature .
To stop the change is impossible That would be against Nature and against ourselves .
Every single word causes a gesture , a thought , a change in the others .
Any decision changes future .
Life and change have also a direction , an aim : growth .
To inhibit the growth of a living being is a cruelty , but sometimes it happens .
Think of those Chinese women obliged to constrain their feet .
Equally cruel , it is , in my opinion , to accelerate the pace of growth by forcing .children to work like adults or by inducing little girls to dress and behave as femmes fatales in video - clips or magazine covers .
Nature is also change , but in a cycling direction , and in a natural rhythm : the movement of celestial bodies , the rotation of Earth , the alternation of days and nights , the sequence of seasons … , in short , the wheel of life .
We lived in a time of accelerated changes .
Technology allows us to do and learn in one life 's time more things than our ancestors were able to in several generations .
But at the same time we are working against Nature - let 's think of pollution and climate change - and against our own human nature : distress , allergies , strokes and heart attacks are nowadays more and more frequent .
Shopping is very important for people .
But some people can get annoyed by this kind of activity . They may be irritated by loud music in the shopping areas , long queues at the cash desk and crowds of customers everywhere .
I do n't belong to any of these groups , because I am not addicted to shopping , but I do love the process of choosing clothes , shoes and accessories . I hate going shopping with my father as he is always advising stupid stuff .
Actually , this is a wrong idea , because I must not waste money on things that are not worth buying .
My name is Alex Yegorov and I am writing to request information about qualification requirements for obtaining a skills assessment in order to submit my Expression of Interest in SkillSelect .
I would appreciate it if you could send me necessary applications forms and associated information relating to the assessment .
It would be appreciated if you could provide assessment procedures , timeframes and charges as well .
I graduated from the University with specialisation in Fiber - optic Transmission Systems .
However now I am working and planning to continue working as a Software Engineer ( 261313 ) .
Would Telecommunications Engineer ( 263311 ) be the right nominated occupation for me ?
Also may I have information on which version of the IELTS should I take , the Academic or the General Version ?
The European Union is created and meant to be an organization that helps all of its members to develop economically and socially while contributing to the common good of the whole union itself .
It works towards allowing all the EU citizens to travel and work freely no matter which country they are from .
Everyone must be accepted and integrate in a specific society .
There should be a working network for providing suitable jobs and standard of living to those , of course , who are looking to work and contribute to society , and do not simply expect to lay on the back of a more economically developed countries .
Many non - EU citizens live and work in Europe but for this to be successful they have to be able to integrate into their receiving society .
In 2015 , after 30 years of service in the Church of the Sacred Heart in Peluzuchampa , north of Bolivia , the priest Inocencio Raudales , 66 years old , realized that the wine drunk at the moment of communion is not the truly blood of Jesus Christ , as he has thought for his whole life .
" I realized about this fact last December when I cut my finger while I was cooking and I sucked the blood that was flowing from the wound " .
Inocencio , surprised by this discovery , asked to his partners in the Order of Saint Bartolo about the taste of their blood , incredibly , after a needlestick in their fingers , all the priests from the congregation agreed that their blood did not taste like the wine converted in Holy blood at the church .
At that time , the Order sent to Vatican an urgent message and called the press for making the announcement of the discovery .
At this press conference Inocencio assured that next year he will try to prove if pigeons truly represent the Holy Spirit .
I 'm glad to hear from you again ! I have to say that you should write in your work that the traditional Portuguese food is delicious !
Usually my eating habits are similar to the most Portuguese ; I have my breakfast around 7.30 and 8.00 , I eat bread with cheese or jam and I drink a large glass of milk with cereals .
At lunch many people eat a lot ! I start with a small soup and then I have the main dish and the desert .
In the afternoon I eat some cookies .
It 's pork which is seasoned with red wine and , then , is well braised .
He was always doing things for them or anyone who asked him .
He lived in Toronto , which is cold city , but which is even colder at 5 am , the time when Tom 's day began .
His first stop was the car garage where he had to pay and take his friend Rob 's car .
The price was supposed to be 10 pounds , but they end up being 25 pounds , so Tom had to put money from his own pocket .
As a concecuence , he had no money to pay for a sod , so he was thirsty all morning .
After taking the car out of the garage , he had to drive all the way to the airport and wait for Rob to come .
Tom was getting really anxious , worryng that he would never make it back to his job at 2 pm , the flight arrived .
It was a quarter to two , so tom laid back in his chair , took a big breath and waited for his workmates to come .
It is one os the most significant places in our capital , Moscow .
First of all , I would like to make it clear that " red " is not related to the colour only , this word also means " beautiful " in Russian .
Moreover , in Red Square one can see the Muasoleum , which is also can be called one of the symbols of our capital and the country .
It seems to me that the following definitions show an overall context of what is cultural literacy .
Cultural literacy is Knowing about and respecting the cultures of others .
To be familiar with something is far different from being an expert in it , and it 's entirely manageable .
According to UNESCO literacy is at the heart of basic education for all and that creating literate environments and societies is essential for achieving the goals of eradicating poverty , reducing child mortality , curbing population growth , achieving gender equality and achieve sustainable development , peace and democracy .
My personal opinion cultural literacy is the way to understand , learn and know about other cultures .
Also you can be understood by other cultures .
Nowadays , the majority of teenagers are not so close with their families as they used to be and mostly they are farther apart from their parents .
The age between 13 to 19 is the revolutionary one .
I get along with my siblings very well but we do not see each other very much .
Not to mention that when I am trying to talk to them they always space out and then say that they have their own problems .
A friend will stay on and listen to you in patience .
To sum up , I do not consider my family to be my best friends and neither they do .
I think it is fair to say basketball is one of the most popular sports on the planet , both in number of viewers and players .
There is probably an array of motives to explain such phenomenon but for me that happens for one particular reason ; the shot clock .
The shot clock is a timer that dictates the amount of time during which one team can maintain possession of the ball .
The idea behind it is to quicken the pace of the game and preventing it from becoming stalled .
A corious fact is that out of the five most popular sports in the world only basketball keeps track of possession time and to me that 's exactly what sets him apart from the others .
While watching or playing any kind of sport , there 's nothing worse than a team or a player trying to waste time untill the clock runs out , the game becomes dull and boring and you ca n't enjoy the excitment that only the uptempo style of play can provide .
The bottom line is ; a fast paced game is a much more exciting experince for players and viewers as opposed to a slow paced one and that makes the " shot clock " fundamental to the dynamics of the game .
And for anyone trying to become a good basketball players the two most important things to understand ( as it is for most sports in general ) are the values of practice and awareness .
Practice is the one thing that can increase the probability of desireable results and awareness is what gives you the ability to adapt to different situations , and the combination of the two is the only way to success , so if you want to be a good player you need to put your energy and focus on practice and stay alert and surveing the court at all times so you can be aware of what is happening around you .
Some people claim that the youth of today is less healthy than they were two decades ago .
Although several causes for this problem can be found in the modernisation of our society , this modern society can also provide solutions for the amelioration of the level of fitness of young people .
However , possibilities to make the youth healthier are also provided by our modern civilisation .
For example , commercials can be used to stimulate youngsters to take up exercise by showing the positive effects .
In conclusion , I feel that not only the ground for the low level of fitness of today 's youth , but also the clue to get youngsters fitter , lies in the modernity .
Good thriller movies have become increasingly rare in the last few years , and to find some among big productions casting famous actors is even harder , if not impossible .
Most of these , in fact , have very predictable plots , are full of cliches and since it 's so easy to figure out how they will end , they are usually very boring .
This is why I was very surprised when I came out of the theater after seeing " Looper " and thought " Hey , I just saw a thriller with Bruce Willis in it , and it was actually a really good one ! "
The story is set in the future , about thirty years from now , when time travel had been invented but was used only by criminal organizations who sent those they want killed in the past where a professional killer , a looper , was waiting for them and for the silver strapped to their body .
By letting his older self go Joe changes his past , and therefore his future , leading to a series of unexpected events , and to an even more unexpected ending !
My expectations were not very high , but I have to say the movie was surprisingly good , in fact it was not boring at all , and had a few big twists which took me completely by surprise .
Time travelling is only a means to the development of the story , and the future society is quite similar to the present one , so even if you are not big science fiction fans , I suggest you give this movie a chance , I am sure you wo n't be disappointed .
In the competitive world that we inhabit , dominating a technique and having a deep knowledge of a given field is essential for both academic and professional success .
The inherent tendency to provide the best to our offspring catalyze parents to invest in their kids as to prepare them for an unpredictable future .
The haste that results from this process does n't allow parents to think over some potentially harmful myths that they take for reality , regardless that it may compromise their kid 's motivation and self - confidence , all because of their " is talent innate or can it be acquired ? " .
Contemporarily , the most wide - spread belief is that some people are born with a talent and some unlucky ones simply are n't .
This assertion may boost the confidence of parents whose children show a remarkable ability in the early infancy , as though this capability could be the celestial sign that their toddler is gifted or going to grow as child prodigy .
The adepts of this idea usually mention extraordinary people in order to reinforce their own believe in their child 's potential to become a known genius .
Little known is what was the role played by music in his life and how was his relationship with it previous to his first deed .
Admittedly , I do n't know it myself .
Any one who challenges the aforementioned common - sense is n't immediately drawn to embrace and believe the less common , but still popular and not scientific , concurrent idea .
The " 10 000-hours rule " is said to have a scientific base , in spite of the fact that most of its defendants have never read the study that stablished it .
According to this rule , any person can develop a talent after 10 000 hours of training .
This amount of time does n't fit normal workers and students ' tight schedules and busy daily lives , therefore being labeled as unpractical and unachievable .
The normal response to this conclusion is , as I and many people who gave up learning a language simply because fluency is out of reach if you do n't have this time available , is the loss of motivation .
Either of them put a heavy burden on parents and on their children .
One asserts that talent is a matter of luck ; the second , of pure time demanding and presumably expensive dedication .
As any other unscientific " truth " that circulates and cause harm to our society , this one can only be eliminated through the reading of scientific and specialised publications on the topic , so that the effective manners of becoming talented in something can be adopted , before the popular believes take our motivation and self - belief away .
This research project will provide us with better understanding and insights into this area through the EM trainees ' narratives and experiences of clinical reasoning development in ED and add to the scientific discourse in clinical reasoning .
A narrative approach to explore and investigate clinical reasoning development can provide a vocabulary that encourages us to integrate insights from different frameworks in ways that combine the strengths of each .
Many people do breakfast in the bar with an espresso or a cappuccino and a croissant .
In the morning we 're not used to eating salty food like salami , eggs or cheese .
My first night here I was invited to a dinner mainly for scientists who are up here doing a radio show .
I 'm placed next to Brain Cox and something inside me wilts because I know I am sitting next to a superior being and he will soon find out I 'm a two - celled worm .
I am next to someone who knows what happened to make the big bang , he sees atoms and electrons and even knows what they are .
He does n't think about things that I , a mere mortal does , like whether or not there is food on my teeth , and death .
To me he is greater than any rock star squared .
I am an English teacher here in my country , Spain , and I have worked with children aged 5 - 14 for five years now in different educational centres .
I am quite enthusiastic about being with kids .
I guess that is why I am a bit workaholic .
I love playing sports , singing , swimming , doing handcrafts , and cooking as well . I enjoy teamwork , and I always share new ideas and good experiences with my colleagues .
I have a great character .
I am quite good at organising sport events and games .
I am aged 20 and currently doing a Barcelona University degree in PE .
I am also a Spanish Red Cross camp leader , as I fancy all kinds of sports such as swimming , sailing , kayaking , rock climbing , etc .
I also have a high level of spoken English because for 8 years I had been attending a summer camp in Scotland , where lately I was asked to carry on as instructor .
I would be suitable for the job advertised because I am extrovert , easygoing , hardworking , thoughtful , and love children and practising outdoor activities such as camping , fishing and cooking , I also enjoy teaching children new skills and helping them to develop their self - confidence .
I would welcome the chance of being part of your company 's team since it is a world renowned firm and I am available to travel and change of residence .
Because of this , I would be grateful if you could send me information regarding incorporation to the organization ( date , conditions , etc )
That 's because there 're many scientific facts have been revealed .
Furthermore , information about these facts have become much more available .
Furthermore , it 's easy to know about these valuable discoveries .
There 're many more libraries and learning courses available than before .
Also , there 're more people who continue their education after graduation from college .
Going to the UK has been a dream of mine but going to Cornwall , however , might be a little of an escapade during the winter , considering that I 'm only used to the relatively hot Egyptian weather .
However , I 'm interested & excited about the journey because it will allow me to have a myriad of new experiences .
On the other hand , I hear people are generally convivial and nature is beautiful in Cornwall .
My life has been on a boring plateau for a while now and I was looking for a change as well as more personal burgeon .
There is a place , in my country , which played a very important role during World Ward II .
As it was full of spruces , it was easy to hide from the German patrols and people from both sides of the border helped Jewish , spies and English , Canadian or American pilots to flee through Switzerland .
A net took place from South of France to Switzerland , espescially to try to save thousands of Jewish children .
People who participated to that " way to freedom " never asked anything in exchange .
They never spoke about it till a few years ago , as they were considered like criminals by their countries as they had broken the law during that time .
But now , they told the whole world about it , some of them are now considered as heroes in Insrael for what they did during these hard times .
Their story was written and folks finally could discover what happened there between the years nineteen thirty - nine and nineteen forty - five .
Last month a monument was erected in their memory so that nobody forgets what happened in that large forest where - as the people would say in that time - German soldiers can not guard all wood , unless they stood behind each spruce ....
Nowadays , public transport is a useful and convenient way of travelling , especially for students , people with low socioeconomic status or for everyone who wants to go to work or school by bus , train or by subway .
It 's also true that more people have cars than maybe 30 of 40 years ago .
Cars are a good way of saving time especially when waiting for public transport , mainly , buses .
But a disadvantage it that cars maintenance and gas is more expensive than paying for public transport .
Airplanes are becoming more and more useful for people who travel for work or even want to get to another place quicker and safer .
I also think that there would be fewer people using public transport in the future but some will still be available because it wo n't be possible for everyone to afford to have a car or travelling by plane .
The function of evaluation and assessment must not only be the recognition of the results of the learning process itself , but also how this process took place , therefore we will need to use different instruments of assessment .
After the assessment and evaluation we will be able to adjust the necessary pedagogic help to individual students , know up to which point the proposed aims have been achieved and we will be able to judge the programme planning as a whole .
Assessment and evaluation will provide information , as well for the teacher as for the students .
As far as the students are concerned , they will be able to correct inadequate strategies or behaviour , know the difficulties they encounter in the learning - teaching process and evaluate their proper process .
As to the teacher , we will find out whether the programme planning was adequate or not and if s / he was sufficiently implied in the learning - teaching process .
Society is continually changing , ever since we create the first civilizations .
That brings us to second point : resources .
As the population grows exponentially , the resouces fail to go along .
We have just started worrying about that but the actions in course are far from enough .
The hard truth is that until somenoe has to face the situation himself , it 's quite difficult to restrain from wasting energy , food , materials , water ...
But in the near future most of us will have to deal with it and therefore be forced to make dramatic changes in our lives in order to survive .
Finally , and on a more positive tone , we 're walking towards a global world .

The pupils have been taught English since their very first meeting with the English language in school so they are completely familiar in using English as classroom language .
The only place where we could imagine a challenge in sticking to English as the classroom language is when the group works .
The evaluation starts by unfolding the brain storm from day 1 , and then it continues by the pupils applying all their new words and knowledge about America .
Hereby we want to create consciousness in the pupils'minds about their new knowledge .
Hereby we both want the pupils to reflect their learning and bring the teacher valuable information for the next time .
In this class there are strong wishes about certain areas regarding America that the pupils want to learn : 10 pupils would like to learn about American High School Life , 4 pupils would like to learn about National Parks in America , 4 pupils would like to learn about Native Americans and 1 pupil would like to learn about American Motor Industry .
Taking the importance of learner autonomy and the importance of the pupils'motivation into consideration we have decided that they can follow their interests in this course .
This also gives the pupils the possibility of presenting their classmates to new knowledge - and the communicative situation is authentic .
Kyiv is a good destination for the shoppoholics .
For those interested in top fashion brands I would recommend visiting the shops in the main street .
The best manufacturers of clothes , linnen , accessories have their shops there . Jewellery and watch shops can also be found nearby .
For those who are looking for cheap , but practical clothes I will recommend to go to one of the shopping malls of the capital .
Mass market clothes , bags , cosmetics , children toys are represented there .
Different shops will offer a wide range of goods and impresse with interesting design ideas and unique style .
The main shopping mall of the city is under reconstruction at the moment , but in one year it will be open for visitors and will surprise them with high tech design and exclusive brands .
And if you try to find a good product for a reasonable price visit the city 's outlet - collections of the previous years are sold there with significant discounts .
AIESEC has 64 years of experience in developing high - potential youth into globally minded responsible leaders .
AIESEC members live an integrated development experience .
Why people become homeless ?
One of the reasons is they are poor because they can not get a job .
I believe we can decline the number of homeless people in Japan by providing them with information and skills .
For example , if they do not have enough money that is needed to have home and to buy things necessary to live , they can get a financial support by government .
Homeless people tend to unable to collect information because of lack in means to do it .
The skills include the ability to communicate with people and to conquer hardships .
Then , he came to know that there was a class that provide homeless people with skills of cleaning floor for free .
Little by little , he grew interest in working .
He came to know how pleasant it is to overcome hard situations .
He also learned to how to build a good relationship with people through talking his fellows .
To conclude , giving information about support that they can receive from the government , and skills is very helpful way to solve homelessness in Japan .
Some of them think global warming is the most significant problem , despite others believe deforestation has a higher impact on our world .
This flooding leads to starvation because of fewer harvest yields and this creates many refugees .
On the other hand deforestation is , as said , another part of global warming due to less carbon dioxide storing trees .
But incinerate a huge part of the rainforest means a destruction of the habitat of wildlife .
Global warming is a primary cause of starvation but also does deforestation .
Because the roots do not hold the fertile soil , and now , it will be blown away by the wind .
To sum up both issues have enormous impacts on our world .
In both animals and people are affected .
But in my opinion , you can stop global warming by stopping deforestation first .
Even though their couple was of the quarelling type , everyone around them , friends and family agreed on the fact that the pair was as solid as a rock , and despite the ups and downs , love had always won in the end .
And each time it occurred , Cecilia burst in tears , and Michael had to rock his sobbing wife like a baby .
It took him three days to calm down and put the things in perspective .
Nowadays , experience is more important than academic knowledge to gain a job .
However , experience is extremely important , I disagree that the academics are not important .
Success in a job depends on the amount of theoretical knowledge that a person had in academic institution .
When employees face any problems or difficulties in work , it must be referred to the theory that explain this phenomenon , without knowing this theory employees ca n't overcome these difficulties , for instance , engineering science seems practical , but each part of engineering science is based on theories .
Thereby , engineers must take demanding knowledge to be successful in a career .
Second of all , theoretical qualifications are crucial for employees , as it helps t people to think and solve all problems in a fair way .
Scientific approach is more important to deal with problems , beginning with determining problems and then studying all factors and related information .
Then employees are able to suggest the best solution , this approach is developed in formal education .
Moreover , studying in a university provides an opportunity to interact with a wide range of people and thus build unique communication skills that are very important for employees .
Finally , knowledge could make an open - mined person who has ability to deal with problems in fairway .
It is the main part that helps employees to be successful in careers .
It is certainly true that markets can not abandon the formal qualification in future .
It depends on where and what kind of place you want to reach and it depends on the time of the day
First what are the advantages of using the bus , or train ?
When traveling to city centers , choosing public transport is to be advised , because parking a car in the city is really expensive and it is very hard to find a space .
When in the center and wanting to enjoy various sights , by car it is hard to get from on place to the other , because the circulation is dense .
IN that way it will take a lot of your time , while the bus or tramway have their own bus lanes , and hence are running smoothly .
In that case the choice for public transport will be preferable .
When traveling to rural areas , it is quite difficult by public transport , because sometimes there is hardly any no train or bus for the far out places and the tiny villages .
Because not may people going to these places , the schedule will be very tight and the bus will only leave once every hour .
Most of these buses will make many stops which makes it even more time consuming .
In the end of the day you should choose public transport or car according to the purpose of your trip .
The Jirga is a ' traditional system ' of justice , which is actively practiced in , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Baluchistan as well as in districts of Sindh bordering with Baluchistan as to resolve legal cases and disputes .
The system , which was in practice since the British rule , was modified under the ' Special Provision Ordinance ( Criminal Provisions 11 ) of 1968 ' .
Besides dispensing justice and dealing with judicial cases , the Jirga also covers all important aspects of monetary , political , and communal life of tribal society .
However , in its present form , the tribal Jirga especially in Sindh province has generated heated debate about its legal position as well as conflict of its rules and codes with the constitution of Pakistan , law of the land or formal justice system as well as international human rights standards and conventions .
Strongest allegation on the Jirga system or ' informal justice system ' has been its unfairness against innocents during the course of decisions and execution on variety of its rules and regulations .
In fact informal justice system is directly proportional to the Jirga that originally owns its roots to Baloch culture and had been transferred to Sindhi society progressively .
Naseer Khan was an able General , trained at the court of Ahmad Shah Abdali , the hero of the third battle of famous Pani Pat . "
In recent years , many nations are developing their own economy rapidly , and it takes that many areas of farmlands and forests are being cut down to build a better and bigger house and a more convenient transportation system .
Frist of all , the biggest problem is that the world 's resources are extremely unequal .
For example , Japan is the world 's third largest economy after the United States and China , its economy is so developed , but food , oil , and other resources are all imported , and it put a lot of heavy industry into developing countries in order to protect its own environment .
Secendly , with the increasing of the earth 's population , the area of farmland is also decreasing .
People in economically developed areas are in the pursuit of the perfect life and the people in the undeveloped areas are strving .
So I think that the government must do something in this respect .
The government should find a balance point between economic development and agricultural development .
I think that it would have to develop science and technology such as Yuan Longping 's hybrid rice , or after the food can make people 's great and then vigorously develop the economy .
As part of the same planet , protecting the global environment is not only the task of the government but also the task of each of us .
I am in my final year of high school which I will leave with a university entrance qualification in July of this year .
I have babysat children of different ages for the last 4 years and have found that so far very satisfying .
My babysitting duties were to bring the children to bed , provide lunch or dinner , play with and read to them .
With regard to the tutorials . I have put together my own exercise material , looked and discussed class tests and helped the pupils with their homework .
Since I worked twice as a group instructor at a local summer camp , I think that I am well - equipped to deal with 8 - 12 year old children from the experience I mentioned .
I hope you will invite me for a job interview , via Skype or in in person and look forward to hearing from you soon .
Suddenly , it got so dark , that I could not see a thing .
I started shouting as my parents were out of sight , but nobody answered .
After a while I started shaking - I was alone in a forest !
So there was nothing better to do but stay in the same place and wait for someone to help me .
I did not have to wait so long , though - after a while I saw our car 's lights glowing in the darkness .
Next time I will be going on such a trip I need to make sure that I have a fully charged mobile with me .
I recently completed the four - year bachelor degree European Studies at Zuyd University in Maastricht .
During the studies , I went abroad to the University of Paris where I studied political sciences and international management .
After my studies I did a master in cultural sciences at the University of Maastricht .
I had worked in a clothing shop in the past , so I have some sales experience as well .
I have done an internship at a reception in one of the best VIP design hotels in Sevilla , Spain .
My duties included check guests in and out , plan and organize group arrivals , assist in cash advances , exchange money , check guest folios and give commercial information to customers .
In this way I have to some extent developed strategic thinking on individual client needs .
During my studies , I had to make several times portfolios and had negotiation classes , so that will be no problem for me .
I am an Italian 24- year - old girl , I studied English during high school and for this reason I travelled in different countries in order to improve the language .
In those places I had the opportunity to communicate with other people from all over the world .
I studied in London for 1 month some years ago and I visited different places such as Brighton or Liverpool where I attended some short summer courses .
I would like to improve my communication skills and I would really love to be an active part of your summer camps trying to do new different things .
For these reasons I think I would be a suitable person for this kind of jobs , I am very open - minded and I love to take care of children because of their beautiful way of thinking and see things in a very simple and natural way .
Cooking is one of the things I like the most and I am not frightened of hardworking since I believe that if you want to improve you have to apply a lot .
I hope you will consider my request , this would actually be a wonderful experience for me .
I would be grateful if you could attend this matter as soon as possible .
I got into his bedroom , and there it was : the letter .
I suddenly knew what had happened , he took his own life , and my heart broke .
Since grandpa passed away I started loving my grandma even more .
That woman knows how to put a smile on kid 's face .
Granny has grey straight hair , deep blue eyes and tiny nose .
She also has pale complexion and black dark circles under eyes .
Grandma 's wrinkled face can be horrofying at night .
She has a really skinny body , and her hand are long and covered in brown spots .
Tone of her voice is so gentle and so calm .
It calmes me down and freaks me out at the same time .
Parents told me that grandma is a very sick person .
And also she is watching me with eyes wide opened .
Lately I could n't get enough sleep because of that .
Nana gives me feeling like I will get killed in my sleep .
It feels just like a horror move .
It is creepy feeling .
But I never thought that it can be that serious .
The Girls used to hang out together , they spent all their free time together and they were absolutely best friends .
Allison was the girl who joined the group together : all of the girls liked her and she was always the centre of attention .
Suddenly Spencer came to the barn , again and told her friends that she had n't seen Allison , instead she thought she 'd heard her scream .
All of the messages include the girls ' secrets oh Allison knew .
And then , Allisons body is found .
In the show , the friends try to find out who " A " is a show Allison was murdered while " A " turns their lives into hell .
On the other hand , lack of privacy is a major disadvantage in a famous person 's life as their personal life 's boundaries are constantly trespassed by paparazzi and journalists .
Besides , the more they succeed , the more their fans expect of them to achieve .
In conclusion , fame may be nice but it 's not an easy path to walk on .
You have money but you do not feel safe , you have friends but you can never be sure if they like you or your money .
I 'm really glad to spend six months in the UK , but it 's really important to plan my days in order to have a good time .
First of all , I would like to work for at least three months in a language school in London as Italian teacher .
In this way I 'd had the chance to know different people from all over the world and at the same time I 'd earn some money to visit the city and the castles of England , where many historical battles were fought .
I was wondering if you do n't mind asking around if a school is looking for a part - time teacher .
After leaving London I 'd love to do two months of volunteering at a children hospital in York .
I read in an ad on the internet that young people are asked to amuse sick children and I 'd be really happy to tear them a smile !
Will you help me writing a striking curriculum ?
My stay is going to conclude with a trip I 've always dreamed : the Cornwall .
I 'm meeting two friends of mine in Bristol where we 're renting a little car and we 're travelling without destination !
Thank you for your advice , kisses !
It had been a hot , summer day .
Michel 's parents were out so it was the perfect excuse to have an amazing party in the living room , even though they forbid him meeting with friends .
When the night fall and all the guests had arrived , Michael started to lose control of the situation .
Suddenly , a deafening noise coming from the dining room stopped the party but nobody knew what happened .
Almost immediately the house was empty , and music turned off , letting Michael realise that his grandmother 's vase valued in £ 2000 was broken down .
Michael decided to blame the dog for the unfortunate incident and when he told his father what had happened automatically he put the dog up for adoption as it was n't the first time , despite of Michael 's attempts to avoid him doing it .
Once they had arrived to the shelter the family started to say goodbye to the dog crying out loud .
Having lived in four different cities ( Brighton , London , Manchester and Cambridge ) in the UK , I have become more flexible to new environment and keen to accept new challenges .
Given my strong academic background and my leadership experiences at university , including the completion of Manchester Leadership Programme , I believe I am a strong candidate for this position . I enclose a copy of my CV and hope very much to be invited for interview .
She had dreamed of living there since she was a little girl , but she also realized that she will leave all the people that she cared about .
At this point , no one knew that she did the interview and the interviewer told her that the job was hers .
Not even her boyfriend knew about this , and she felt ashamed because deep inside her , she did knew that he will feel betrayed and probably he did n't want to be with her anymore .
But if she did n't take this job , she would regret it her whole life , and live with that was something she was not willing .
She thought that she could have done things different , but it was too late to change them .
I am a very energetic , hardworking , caring , tolerant , fun to be with 30 years old woman who loves spending time with children .
Furthermore , as a former scout I have necessary skills in organizing different sports games and I am familiar with wide range of evening activities .
In addition , as a mother of 8 and 12 years old boys , I have a vast knowledge of children 's psychology and am an excellent cook .
Besides , while being as an exchange student in the USA during my school years , I have improved my English speaking and communication skills .
Regarding the living arrangements , as I understand , food and accommodation are provided by the summer camp .
And I am confident that I would be a beneficial member of your summer camp team .
Looking forward to your reply , please feel free to ask me any questions .
But then , every once and a while , one can also hear stories of brothers fighting over the inheritance , or a parent not speaking to their child for making a wrong life decision .
The members of your family in deed are your best friends , but only if you do n't take them for granted , if you respect them and their space and opinion .
I have been asked last week to write a report about the best places for young people in my area .
Those are my findings and my recommendations .
It was renewed last year and regulars like it a lot .
Kids have to pay 10 euros just for the entrance getting anything else .
- There is another place where local youth spend a lot of hours the new and magnificent mall .
It has 150 stores and about 40 fast food shops .
They especially like the music store and a magnificent t - shirt store owned by two local designers , there you can design your own item and collect it the following week .
My name is Susanne White and I would like to apply for the position as a camp assistant advertised on the Crash Magazine .
I will be on vacation from July to September and I would be glad to work again with children .
Apart from my experience in Arts , I also have been doing gymnastics for ten years ; therefore I am a sporty girl .
An individual must be aware of the result of his act on the environment , be it due to personal or professional act , in order to maintain it in healthy state .
In Clayton , my hometown , people are fond of maintaining the environment and they actively participate in encouraging the ones who try to work towards its progress as well as in protesting against the ones who tend to cause harm to it .
The municipal board of Clayton conducts meetings fortnightly to communicate about the improvements that have been made and that have been planned to be implemented in future in the town .
Earlier , regardless of whether the rubbish was recyclable or not , it was disposed off in the same bin .
Later , people were educated regarding recyclable , non - recyclable and organic waste and were also informed that the rubbish was to be disposed - off in respective bins .
Hence , the municipal board decided to invite the developers as well in the meeting that was scheduled in a weeks time .
In the following meeting , it was decided that on the following Sunday everyone will be planting a tree that will be provided by the municipal board for free .
On the following Sunday , as discussed , trees were planted and before we realized , they started adding beauty to our town .
Taking care of environment is everyone 's duty and it must be performed responsibly .
The municipal board of Clayton does an excellent job in educating its people to keep the environment in a healthy state .
I hope people must take them as an example and introduce similar ideas in their own towns or villages .
One day Michael woke up from a strange dream , the dream was focused from a camera that was following a shadow in front of it .
Everything was dark except for a ray of light that probably started at the end of that way .
The shadow kept walking and running from what Michael supposed it was a threat .
Michael was confused , he did n't know why he had dreamed that , he thought it would be better to forget about it so he stopped thinking about his dream .
That day Michael had to go to work , so he woke up from his bed and went to his bathroom .
When he was ready he took his keys and everything he needed , he locked the door and went to his job .
When he arrived at the building where he worked he took the elevator and when to his floor .
Since he had entered the building he have had a strange feeling , when he arrived to his office Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Further to our phone conversation of last week , I would like first to thank you for giving me this chance to talk to you , and following up on our discussion , please note that we have been approached by the purchasing department at the hospital to give them our maximum discount to secure the deal as a lot of brokers were quoting with a very competitive price which very close to our cost .
In light of the above , and as agreed I seek your kind help in approving the price of $ 30.00 per each to close this deal in a safe way .
After an hour Mindy was holdin her baby- girl and Peter was trying to realize what had just happened .
" Never would have I thought that I 'll go out of my house and come back as almost an accousher ... " thought Peter when he was driving back home .
Computer 's have become an essential part of our lives in the last few decades .
They have replaced many things like books .
However , they stopped us from doing many fun things as well , what are those things , do we really need computers , are they really helping us ?
They were invented to help us calculate things in the first place anyway .
But us , ordinary people , do n't use computers to solve equations , we use them to type things , print things , design things , make games and to do much more ...
We made programs that make computers do very interesting things , like graphics .
Furthermore , the major thing that computers made easier for us is , communication .
Humans are social animals , we communicate because communication is in our genes , if we do n't communicate we go insane .
So computers help us do that , they help us share our thoughts and feelings with other people easily .
In the other hand , computers have very bad effects on both to us , and the environment .
Also looking at a screen is tiring for your eyes and if your eyes get too tired they can get damaged forever .
Computers made our lives easier without doubt , so it is normal that they have some bad effects .
There is a saying in Turkish saying ' If you love a rose , you have to withstand against it 's spikes . ' .
In my opinion computers might be the best invention ever made , since they 've become an essential part of our daily lives and since we rely on them so much .
Lucila Marcelo and I have met at secondary school and we have been friends for seven years .
We have also worked together in a kindergarten for some time and this year we started our studies in an institution in order to become primary teachers .
Lucila has proved herself to be extremely sincere and reliable person since I met her .
As a student , she is persistent and hardworking as well as respected by teachers and students because of her sympathy and kindness .
Lucila is the biggest out of six siblings so she is used to babysitting children .
When we worked at the kindergarten she was very patient and caring with the children and also she was willing to help them whenever they had a problem , even if that implied had work for her .
I can confirm that she had a special connection with the kids : she was admired by them , who would spend a great time with her .
She would undoubtedly do an excellent job and for the reasons I have given I have no hesitation in supporting her application .
That is actually a mistake , because the schools who best prepare students to working life are technical institutes , who emphasize the real world applications of the studied subjects through laboratories and industry experiences .
Conversely , grammar schools extremely focus on theory .
What I would suggest in order to deal with this problem is to integrate more laboratory experiences also in grammar schools , like chemistry experiments or bacteria observation with microscopes .
I am a native Spanish speaker who has a very good level of English and also I have spent 5 years living in the United Kingdom .
I am used to organising sporting events and fun activities for children and teenagers aged between 6 - 19 .
In addition , I have experience working in restaurants during the summer so I am used to all types of kitchen duties including cooking and washing up .
Nobody can argue with the fact that education is a relevant period in the development of a child .
Learning new languages is very important , but also studying subjects related to computers and technology like computer programming is becoming more and more useful than ancient languages like Greek or Latin .
This is because technology has become a relevant tool for work and study in particular and an important instrument in life in general .
On one hand , it allows the students to understand and translate ancient texts and helps them to learn about cultures from the past .
On the other hand , this does not bring too many employment opportunities .
Recent surveys proved that the study of these languages does not add much to the students future success .
Related to learning computer programming , it guarantees a good living .
Furthermore as technology changes more and more , there will be a greater demand of these skills in the future .
It is evident that technology is in every aspect of our lives .
In conclusion , there are a lot of subjects that might be taught at school , but there is no doubt that Computer Programming should be included as a highlighted subject in the syllabus of any school serious programme .
I consider them as my favorite band since 2010 , because I had the chance to get to meet them watching The X Factor 's episode where they auditioned .
When they dropped their second album , I was so excited about it and I waited like 2 hours on the line of a music shop to get it . Years passed by , and I was still a fan of them , as I am now .
It contains twelve tracks to enjoy that you wait impatiently for the next song .
That fascinating album surprises not only the variety of subjects but also the strength of instrumental sounds .
It is bound to be at the top of my list .
False alarm , which is the second track , is totally different and mysterious because of wealth of musical instruments .
Groban sings well - known from the film ' Once " song called ' Falling slowly ' in his own fantastic way but listeners get used to the first version might be disappointed .
Musically satisfying ' Happy in my heartache ' tells the story of tragic love .
I definitely recommend that album to your collection .
Besides , he also came to being keen on learning foreign languages so much so that he decided to enroll on courses of French and German .
When the exam was finished , he went out the room where the competition had been held .
The reason I am writing to you is poor quality of a food processor , which I bought in your store two weeks ago .
After using two times , problems started to appear .
I noticed that the first malfunction was safety lock which demanded applying of great force .
We discovered that another problem when tried to use the blender .
It started working but suddenly got stuck and we were unable to use it since .
I was very surprised to discover that many problems in a quite expensive model .
After two weeks the food processor had still not arrived .
As a solution he offered that upgrade my model to a better and this too will take two weeks .
I am very disappointed with both the equipment and the service have I received .
Therefore , I expect refunding my full amount $ 180 as soon as possible .
Not only do I have a big nuclear family who is made up by four siblings , but I also have a big extended family .
Besides as I am the eldest brother , I am used to dealing with children .
Regarding my experience , on the one hand , I take part in a soccer club in university , consequently , I have some experience working in a team .
On the other hand , I have just finished my first year in Physical Education degree , where we played a lot of different sports .
It is true , that water sports are not the most usual there , however , I enjoy practising them every summer on the beach .
I feel I would be the person you are looking for because I am patient and alert .
These are the most important skills when you deal with children , due to de fact that you ought to keep on the lookout for their behaviour .
Moreover , from my point of view , children need to focus their attention in a constant activity , my sense of humour and creativity allow me to change activities quickly in order to maintain their attention .
If you offer me the chance to join your team , you shall not be disappointed .
Those days , travelling by car is becoming more popular among urban people .
This kind of transport is regarded as a covenient way .
Government build more roads and more families are able to afford cars .
However , I disgree with this idea .
Instead , I suppose that public transport will play an essential part in future life .
There are three advantages of public transport over private cars that I want to explain .
On one hand , it is enviornmentally friendly to use public transport rather than cars .
Nowadays , buses using electronic power instead of petrol have appeared in urban cities .
They produce no gas to the air , leading to little air pollution .
In the meanwhile , if people prefer to take buses or subways , there will be less noises in the street .
On the other hand , buses and subways can accommodate more passengers while a car can only contains 4 to 5 people totally .
Compared with cars , public transport has larger capability of conveying , which saves space and costs less .
Last but not least , fewer car accidents will happen if people choose to use public transport so traffic jams will be avoided especially in rush hours .
In conclusion , public transport is a cost - effective way for people to travel , which also contributes to the sustainable development of society .
The statement claims that the educational institutions are responsible for convincing students not to put too much effort on fields or subjects that they are not good at , which I can not agree with .
This statement fails to consider the main function of education , which is not training superstars or perfect robots but teaching students how to face and solve the problems they are confronted instead of escape .
The responsibility of education institutions should be helping and guiding students to make their own decisions , not making decisions for students .
Among various purposes of education , in my opinions , the most important one is teaching students to solve problems .
Confronting the challenging instead of turning aside , trying to think of possible solutions instead of giving up at the beginning , always being positive to unknown instead of negative and retreating , all these are the main reason why the humankinds can keep improving .
Transferring these knowledge and experiences to young people is the meaning of education .
If the educational institutions always stopped students from trying just because they have less chance to be successful , we 'll never have people such as Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein , who were considered as stupid kids in school but did n't give up trying .
One may suggest that everyone need to learn to assess the risk before invest , however , teaching students how to assess not assessing for students is the responsibility of educational institutions .
Truly that knowing one 's limit is the first step of bringing out the maximum value of one 's talent .
It 's not smart to encourage people doing what exceed their ability .
Nevertheless , the ability of identifying limit of oneself can be best learned from experiences .
The responsibility of the educational institutions is to make sure that he / she wo n't be in danger in the swimming pool instead of dissuading him / her from getting close to the water .
Educational institutions should guide students to have better self - understanding and self - assessing , not persuading them to follow the pre - decided road .
What if a student would rather to do something he / she likes instead of he / she is good at ?
Not everyone is living for the kind of success which most people agree with , such as wealthy , fame or power .
For some people , living a life which enable them do what they like and like what they are doing is enough to be considered as a successful life .
They might not be the top , but they are self - actualized and satisfied , and only in such situation they can provide most to the world , just like Albert Einstein has said , " Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value . "
Considering all the above , I can not agree with the statement that persuading students not to pursue field of study in which they have less possibility to be successful is the responsibility of the educational institutions .
In my opinions , the purpose of the education is to teach and guide students how to facing the problems and making their own decision properly , not force them to accept what have already been arranged for them .
The most popular TV programme in Germany is definitely the news programme " Tagesschau " which is airing about three times a day on the channel " Das Erste / ARD " .
It is a news programme based on well researched facts and offers a wide range of all the important information you need .
Every now and then they even air an extra reportage on a certain field like the European election or the crisis in the Ukraine .
The main reason for its popularity is its accuracy and funded research which makes it more reliable than other news programmes .
Moreover they try to be interesting for all ages so they post on facebook and twitter as well which draws the attention of the younger generation to the programme .
Nevertheless they always inform about the latest news on their website and in their TV show as soon as possible and in addition they give a great overview of the necessary background information you need .
In my personal opinion I strongly believe that this TV programme earns its popularity .
The way they present themselves in the media and the well funded research are truly unique in German news programmes .
Although I am rarely watching the show on TV I like the way they are trying to keep up with modern technology and that they are always making boring nes so vivid interesting through short video clips , pictures and their choice of words .
If you ever get to watch TV in Germany you should definitely try out this interesting news programme .
Do you get along with your superior ?
Last summer I finally managed to change my boring job and that tiny clothes job for a better one .
We 'd get there at about half past eight every day and started cleaning the main room and proceeding with the smaller rooms in the cinema .
It was a lot of fun mainly because it was just us two .
We 'd make jokes and chase each other with the brooms , trying to smack the other on the head .
The main advantage of working at the local cinema was the free popcorn and getting to enjoy the newest films .
My job was cleaning the cinema , but Fred 's main responsibility was to roll the movies for the clients , so I 'd make sure I finished cleaning earlier , so I could enjoy watching movies with him .
For last ten years Michael had been working in a well - known company in London as an accountant .
He did like his job but as we all know , sometimes people suddenly feel they have to change something .
One day he woke up much earlier than used to .
He prepared a coffee for himself and turned the TV on to watch the news .
He sat on a sofa in front of a television and suddenly he realised the fact that every morning was exactly the same , nothing has changed since such many years ! "
I wo n't stand it any longer " - he thought .
Since Michael was a child he has always dreamt of moving to Australia , where he could practise kitesurfing for all day long , meet open - minded people , chill on a sandy beach and drink a good Australian alcohol .
At that moment he was pretty sure what to do now .
After 10 minutes a resignation letter was ready to bring it to Michael 's boss .
He arrived on the company as quickly as the crowded London 's streets allowed him .
" I need to talk to boss " - he said to Jane , the main secretary of the company .
Without waiting for her answer , he just went into the office , gave to Mike , his boss for 10 years , an envelope with a resignation letter and left .
Sometimes we do things we do n't want for no apparent reason but some other times we know exactly where we are getting into .
There was no way to shine a different light to that fact .
He could not keep his betrayal inside any longer so he entered the living room and told her .
The words coming up from his mouth like a litany , almost mechanically as he realized that there was no turning back .
The relieve of telling her was instantly replaced by a bitter hollowness .
He did n't do it for her , he only did it for himself , to get rid of his burden but it was far too late .
Glitz , glamour and popularity ; three words which are often linked to the world of football and this sport in no doubt one of the finest that man has created .
The 90 minutes is the most enjoyed time of the week though because of the adrenalin rush that is associated with every thing that is done on the pitch .
As a fan supporting a team is just one part of the sport .
Rivalries , arguments on which team is the better team and watching matches in a group just adds to the excitement .
With regard to this sport any advice in my opinion is a good advice and I have just a single advice for a person starting this sport and that advice would be to enjoy everything related to the sport .
Nowadays students need to learn both language and mathematics until go to university , even some of them still need to study them in the university .
A large number of examples prove that some of them are good at language whereas others are skilled in mathematics .
This essay will discuss the differences and similarities for learning a language and learning mathematics .
For studying a language , people need to communicate with others to improve their speaking and listening levels and read variety of overseas book to increase their reading and writing skills .
In general , studying a language focuses more on a large account of individual effort and little talent .
However , for learning mathematics , students need to listen carefully in the class and find some rules to solve questions . Instead of rote learning , they should remember different types of formulas by practicing in a mass of examples .
However , there are some similarities for those two subjects .
Firstly , both those courses need to do a mass of practices , even the ways are different .
People need to spend a huge account of time on doing exercise after class .
For example , when people learn a new word or a formula , they need to think about how to use it in real sentence or exercises .
In conclusion , people need to find a right way which can save much time and energy to study these two subjects .
It is the most important thing that they should think about carefully before they start their study .
However , the young I soon discovered that some dimensions of difference do carry social significance .
A feminine gay man is considered as lesser than his masculine counterpart , because femininity is regarded as weak , unattractive , and second - class .
She chose little , cosy restaurant near her house .
She did not suspect that it will be such a wonderful evening .
As soon as Anna and her friends came into restaurant everything started to go perfect .
Then all got special clothes and dressed up in colourful , old - fashined dresses .
She said to friends : ' This is best party ever !
She started to dance with double Presley , laugh and appreciate every single minute .
As it turned out later , to Anna 's surprise , it was her boyfriend dressed as Presley .
But immediately she realize that it was one of her friends ' tricky plan and she started to laugh with them .
After a few exciting hours of the party she said thank you to her friends and boyfriend and promised she will never forget what they did for her .
She went to sleep with belief that she is the happiest girl in the world .
Its historical importance lies in the fact that this place represents the fall of the Muslim kinddom in my country .
The Catholic Monarchs , Isabella and Ferdinad , had tried for several years to defeat the muslims , who at this time , only remained seated in the city of Granada .
Its surroundings are also wonderful , and the city invites you to spend more time in the Alhambra , one of the last Muslim palaces in the word .
I haven't seen you for almost two months but , as you know , on November I had a one of a kind possibility to help at a concert that took place on airport runway and it was simply amazing experience !
I 'm sure you do know that I 'm obsessed with rock music and that is why I could n't miss the boat .
An event started at 7 p.m. but all the volunteers who had signed a contract had to work from 8 a.m. Everything has to be perfect during such events so we had no time to relax or even eat a decent meal !
People looked like aggressive monsters and I realised that they are close to kill their every single ' rival ' .
Security guards had a lot of work to do but thanks to them we stand a chance to deal with other problems , as for example regulating the quality of sound .
A band was playing , we were enjoying music and it seemed that there will be no more complications .
What you actually think in such an extraordinary moment is that life could n't be more beautiful .
just a quick answer to your request .
So , the deal is , I met this guy in the bar , Ron , and we started talking .
After a few drinks I told him that I 'm currenly looking for a job , nothing big , just a couple of hours during weekends to gather some money for my journey to Netherlands .
It 's literally 10 - 15 hours on Fridays nights and Saturdays , stuff like carrying instruments ( which means hanging out with musicians ) , tyding after ( finding things , like wallets and cellphones ) and generally speaking - helping .
Last week I worked most time with the manager of The Kooks .
In fact I had to be everywhere with the guy , just hanging and helping him not to get lost in the city .
He 's a really nice guy , during the concert we had a few drinks , smoked some fags together .
Usually I get 12 PLN per hour ( yeah , I know , It 's like 2,50 pounds , but here it 's quite good ) but sometimes I get some extra money for staying after hours or when I do something unusual to help .
Last time it was for example delivering my drunk boss home ;)
Take care and call me on Skype tomorrow - I 'll tell you so much more , I have plenty of unbelievable stories !
I 'm a chemist I ca n't kill people becasue I wanted to .
The police was gon na come in any time .
He grabbed the body and put it on the car 's trunk .
His partner said : Man , we have to do something and quick .
They grabbed the body and soaked him on fuel .
Later , when they were sure that there were no one near they burned the car .
The killers partner felt guilty for a moment but then the killer told him : ' He earned it .
Saddly the police found out that it was them .
Thanks that the judge 's best friend had been killed by the man the chemist killed so they went out free and without bad feeling .
The enthusiastic and clever Elizabeth stands out among them striving to put everything in a broader perspective .
However , their whole lives will be turned upside down when an elegible bachelor and his friends set up home in a close mansion .
All in all , will each one be able to overcome their own pride and prejudice ?
Therefore dialogues , settings as well as politeness , costumes and hairstyles are meant to give it greater public appeal , sacrificing historical accuracy .
Thus , overlapping dialogues are introduced in a mixture of modern idiom and archaic sentence structure , several scenes have been shifted to more romantic settings , and the proximity of the Bennets to their rural life is stressed to illustrate their relative poverty in contrast with the rich characters of the story
I am 45 years old man and I have plenty of experience in working with people .
I used to work with young people in primary and secondary schools teaching Spanish language .
Although I still have not passed the FCE exam I am currently working hard to fulfil the goal very soon .
Above all I am interested in films .
Science fiction are my favourite type of films because I like to leave behind normal life nevertheless , I enjoy all kinds of them such as comedies , thrillers , westerns , horror films and even silent films .
I think I am right for the position because I think I can boost the motivation of the people about movies and push them up to share their particular point of view .
As far as the job is concern working on Monday and Wednesday evening would be perfect for me because I am currently unemployed .
Our club members are thrilled knowing that an international sports star like you is coming to see them .
In reference to the speech date , the best would be June 12 in the evening , when all the members will have finished their classes at school .
What about talking about fair play at sport and how to become a sports star ?
We believe that fair play is a very important topic because children must learn to behave properly when playing a sport .
Also , we think that becoming a sports star is difficult and it would be a good idea to talk about it because some of the club members wrongly think it is easy to succeed playing a sport .
Some of these thoughts make us smile , some frown .
I have written many poems , few articles and even a few stories .
It is certainly a pleasure to write and also reading what I have written , after a long time .
Many times reading my own poems and articles is a surprising experience . "
" I ask myself , wondering how did I come up with some ideas and words that seem just so good and uncommon right now .
Other than myself , I have had few people reading what I have written ; very few , I must say ; maybe only 2 or 3 ; and they were not critics or experts .
So , I have yet to submit myself to some serious criticism ( well , calling my writings literature is a huge joke in itself ... anyway ) ; but yes , I would like to place my written works ( however small and few they may be)for qualitative discussions in front of people who really can identify the good and the ' not - so - good ' writing .
I would like getting good advice about how can I make myself a better writer .
Do we know what does it mean to be a friend ?
Firstly we ought to consider that friendship is not uniquely a human emotion .
Friendship is overall an acto of will .
Friendship is a type of love which is characterized by being incondicional , reciprocal , and ready to forgive each other .
A friend is a treasure , as the title of that adventure - comedy film , somebody you can share your problems with .
Somebody who listens to you talking about your dreams and wishes , your expectations and your efforts and sacrifices to get them , your plans for the future , and moreover pays special attention on times of crisis .
Finally , they warn me of danger but they let me do , even if in the end I 'd make a big mistake . They 'd keep always close to me and neither would fail .
They feel happy when I am happy , they are sad when I am sad , they enjoy themselves with my success .
Many believe that the portrait is that of DaVinci himself , while many also place a lot mystic connections with this painting .
The portrait depicts a woman 's bust , with a distant landscape that is visible in the backdrop .
Leonardo used a pyramid design to install the woman in a simple and calm manner within the painting .
The light is diffused so that the various curves and geometrical shapes on the painting are made visible through it .
Some winding paths and a far away bridge is also perceptible in the background .
Without the interference of the government , criminals may see their chances to take advantage of internet users .
However , if the government were to monitor the citizens actions more closely , it would be considered an invasion of our privacy .
Nobody wants to have their private data to be exposed to the eyes of the government .
That way , the most of the trouble would be kept away from the internet while at the same time , the internet users would still have the freedom to explore the web .
Family characteristics such as eye and hair colour are inherited by children from their parents as well as some diseases and mental disorders .
This provides evidence that life experiences and surrounding where you grow up have defined the kind of person you are today .
Regarding personal skills , there are a large number of cases in which children were born gifted for the same field as their parents having great potential for a specific art or science since early childhood .
According to this fact , parents often shape their children 's lives encouraging them to follow in their footsteps .
Likewise , some people put their success in life down more to their parent 's training than to their innate talents .
So , to conclude we would have to argue that both nature and nurture make us who we are .
The problem is how to separate these two influences and how to find out which the strongest is in each case .
Your new friends seem to be crazy guys , in a good way , of course .
As I 've got some extra money at last , I think It 's high time for me to think how to make it cozy and comfortable .
First , I think about painting the walls in warm colors ( apricot , salmon or warm beige ) . I thought you might add some more interesting colors to the list .
Do you think a wall mural is a good decision for the bedroom and what other « special effects » would you recommend ?
I completely rely on your taste as we 've always been on the same wavelength .
Now , the toughest questions . I 've got no clue what to do with the ceiling .
I hope I do n't bother you too much with my redecoration , knowing how busy you are .
CONVENIENCE IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT
We do that for work or to finally get a rest .
I , as a young women , usually travel just as a hobby .
Since the technology has improved in recent years , we now have a huge variety of different ways to travel .
The most common answer would be probably the plane .
Travelling on a boat for sure is a great adventure .
In my country trains are n't really fast and there could be problems during the trip but that 's for me makes it more interesting .
During the trip you can do many things - from sleeping to meeting new people and making fun .
It is also quite safe so you do n't have to worry about the accidents .
The trip is an adventure and the ways you can travel are a big part of it .
back in 2010 , I traveled from Porto Alegre to Sao Paulo by car , a course that took 18 hours driving straight , surely very few people would consider it convenient .
cars are handy and driving can be pleasant , but only when the driver is in good mood , with no traffic jams or craters on the road ( really common situations in Brazil ) .
Since ancient times exist public transport , and it suffered numerous attempts of assassination , in China for example , the dynasty Yuan prohibited public transport ( at that age , charriots ) because of fear that Han people could plot and riot against mongol 's dictatorship in it ; the situation inverted at early socialist regime when , in 1960 , Mao considered personal cars as instrument of opression and symbol of devilish capitalism .
we have cars so we do n't have to walk , in the same fashion , people who ca n't afford a car will want public transport , even if a bike could be the solution .
The convenience has litlle to do with the fate of public transport , countries with high HDI(convenience to be drivers ) , like Germany and England , are those with better public transport system , and they are even boosting it .
Unless some extraordinary mutation happens and change us to some labor - lovers , personal cars and public transport will rule side by side for all eternity .
Hi ! My name is Alexia , I am twenty - three years old and I live in Argetina .
I have been learning English for a while , I am sensitive and positive person , full of energy and willing to have new adventures .
I have experience at taking care of children and it is a task that I really enjoy .
What I fancy the most of being with young children is the energy that they have and how innocent and peaceful the can be .
I think I might be a suitable person for the job because I have already work with kids , especially at teaching and having fun .
As I have alrealdy said , I play sports that is why I could be helpful at organizing sports and evening activities .
And last but no least , I am an excellent cooker .
I learned how to cook when I was eight , so I am pretty much confidente and well prepared .
Actually , my family is huge so I can cook big amounts of food with my own recipes which are tasty and quickly in order to feed all the kids in a glimpse .
If you get to hire me you wouln't regret it .
The process can be divided into three sections .
Then it comes to the preparation of metal plates and that needs skilled machinists .
Only after all the work above is completed , can printing step be carried out .
Besides , The images can be slightly raised .
After printing , there is much more work to be done .
The most important step is inspection manually .
After that , good quality sheets and bank notes separated from partially damaged sheets will be packaged and distributed .
Bad sheets and bank notes will be securely destroed .
There are near to France and Andorra .
There are lots of ski stations with good ski slopes of different levels with different colours , the greens are the easiest and blacks are the most difficult .
When there is n't any race you can go and try different racing cars or if you want you can go and race a bike on the race track .
To sum up I think that if you want to do exciting sports Catalonia is a good place where you can find lots of different sports and you can choose what to do , but if you do n't want to do sports you can do another activities or go on interesting places .
Michael tried the cream and thought that her mother would n't notice it if he ate another bit . '
That night the time flew by , but things started to get weird , Marcus was talking with an Australian guy about the proofs that he had found related to dinosaurs , he was interested in them , but Marcus did n't like his point of view about those species , the guy told him they were bad creatures with no feelings , and Marcus thought they were awesome and the most lovely creatures he had never heard about , the guy thought Marcus was crazy , so he flew from the Federal Palace .
Meanwhile , Mark and Michael were talking with Russian ladies , they were beautiful and flawless , the scientists started talking about science and that sort of thing , and suddenly the ladies vanished , the men started crying .
Jack , was arguing with an officer about Mexico conquest ( the officer did n't understand anything because Jack was drunk ) , and suddenly , the officer took off his costume and a strange mask , and in that moment … Jack was astonished because the officer was not an officer , he was Brad !
Jack tried to confront him , but as soon as he tried to do that , he snapped his fingers and a lot of people came around him , he had a new team , he decided to name them " The KM-3J " , a villains team , their names were Karolina ( she decided to change his name like that because he used to say that that letter was her favorite one ) , Melanie , Miley ( they were both twins , the most beautiful ladies of the world ) , Max , who was an expert in the military field , and Brad Rowley J. , nobody had known his last name until that moment : Junior , he was embarrassed about it , he was descendant of a weird woman , however she was her mother .
The KM-3J put Jack into an immense bag , they were planning to kill him and place his dead body in a grave , in that way their friends would find him buried , but they were not that evil , they just put him into a dark room and tied his hands in a chair , it was exactly the same thing he was dreamed about .
While Jack was there , he heard Brad talking with Max about their new plan , it was related to a gigantic weapon that would shoot toxic wastes at New York city , so in that way , everybody would become a zombie .
The bulk of the population from New York was homeless because there has just been a horrible war between New York City and California , however , increasingly refined body technologies allowed New York to win the war .
Jack was frightened , but suddenly he heard the door opening and saw their friends rescuing him , they had used some weapons from The King of the Sky , they got into the room and started shooting while Michael was unleashing Jack from the chair , accidentally , Mark killed Miley while he was shooting , all her body parts were scattered on the floor , he did n't care about and flew with the others .
When they arrived at mainland , Jack woke up , there was n't anyone around him , there was just sand and the beach …
Hence , it is not possible to do job and study side by side .
Occupation and education disturb one another .
I will elaborate points to support my opinion in the further paragraphs .
Firstly , there are a lot of people in western countries , who do a part - time study and work full - time or vice - versa .
This not only makes them knowledgeable but increase their potential as well .
Secondly , there are a few parents who can not bear the expenses of their child 's education .
Resultantly , they put their children into some labor so that they can earn money for the family .
But it does not mean that the child has to abandon his dream of acquiring education .
Finally , sometimes people think they have completed their education , but when they get a full - time job , they realize that diploma or degree can increase their chances of promotion .
I write to you to express my interest to apply for the weekend worker job that was posted on your cafe door .
I believe I am a good fit for this task since I had previous experience working in similar jobs .
I demonstrated courteous and professional attitude and achieved a high rating in the customer satisfaction survey .
Moreover , I have education in the field of customer service since I finished a customer service training course at George White College .
I am also a quick learner and adapt to different working environments .
Duped , so to say , into this unlikely event , a date night .
Was it the party which lasted until 3 am the night before ?
Was it at the invitation to the wedding three weeks ago ?
How far back could it possibly go .
So many twists and turns - she played her cards well , I never suspected while sitting in the pews next to my wife that when she leaned forward with a pained expression on her face that the evening would end at D'el Arte .
Nor when her condition appeared to worsen and I decided to go get the car to take her to the doctor 's office , nor when I returned to find her lying on the cold hard stone floor of the church could I have ever imagined we would be enjoying a quiet evening together sharing entrees and desserts .
Nor could I have conceived after having multiple people help calling the ambulance , which never came , or the friends who called my in - laws to come take care of the kids , that we would be eating a wonderful pizza by the end of the evening .
No , none of these things would have prepared me for the relief I would feel after waiting 4 hours in the emergency room that her pains were probably only intercostal muscle pains and the test for something more serious were all negative .
I 'm writing as an answer for an advertisement for a job in the USA .
I think I would be fit for this job , because I am young , energetic , enthusiastic and have always enjoyed working with children .
I can speak English since I used to vacation in Australia as a child .
I grew up with two younger brothers and used to look after them therefore I am used to dealing with younger kids .
In my opinion this job would be a great , helpful experience .
I 'm Antonio Trevisano del Bruno , an Italian 15-year - old teenager , and I have studied English since I was 7 .
I am a really sporty person and I think I would be the person who you are looking for because I 'm really capable and patient with children .
So , I do n't find difficult to organize competitions or activities for children .
I 'm a really cheerful person and , though I am 15 , I 'm keeping up with the kids ' world .
Yours sincerely
My goal I decided then , was to become a pilot when I grewn up .
Suddenly my plane began to act up , I was losing control .
I looked at the plane and realized I forgot to tie the parachute cord to the plane .
Thank God I did n't jumped or I would have been a ' dead duck ' for sure !
My mom has a kindergarden and I love helping her out .
Every summer I help my mom 's summer camp , but it 's a summer camp of babies and I would like to work wth older children because I think it 's more challenging . I would love to work at any placeacross th US .
I am very good at artistic things , such as , drwaing , paining , cooking , dancing and a lot of other things .
I hope to get this job because I have been waning it for a very long time .
I would be very hap to get it .
Last month , as you may know , I was a volunteer on occasion of my favourite band 's concert in Katowice .
It was just a miracle - it had turned out that the band 's manager was my good old friend Daniel and he asked me for help when he found out I was a big fan of the group .
At first I had to be involved in it a month before the event was started .
I was asked to give some information about the concert to local pubs , restaurants etc .
so I was handing leaflets everywhere .
By the time the event was upcoming , I had to take over the band 's equipment .
I had to move it from place to place along with boys from the group .
One thing leads to another and we ended up having a beer and laughing in a pub .
If you will ever have an opportunity to help by this kind of event , I recommend it to you from the bottom of my heart !
I 'm very happy to hear from you since both have been quite busy these days with the exams .
You have always wanted to be policewoman ( unless you have recently changed your opinion ) so you must be very fit since you need to pass the physical tests , which are very demanding , according to my mother .
Sport is something essential to get this goal and you can always practise music at home when you have some free time ( yes , I know that it happens once in a month ) .
Moreover , you wrote to me that you have started to give lessons about guitar so you are not going to be isolated from music and it goes on playing an important role in your life .
So I think you should n't be upset because now it is a difficult period , I know , but it passes and we can get back our life when we go to university .
My cousin , who is studying English Literatura , told me that you have much more freedom when you start university , so do n't worry !
I hope you write to me when you make the final decision , I look forward to hearing from you .
He can remember his name , Thomas , but that 's all he can remember : everything importanthas been wiped clean .
Lnguage itself also becomes vitally important : the boy 's speech is peppered with made - up words that highlight the isolation .
The book ends devastating final twist .
The task is unambiguous and seemingly easy . I should be able to describe my view of American man and his behavior because of my experience as an adult , a woman , a wife , a mother and simply a human being with various roles in life who has been million times happy and million times unhappy .
No . I think that I can depict this one American man within a certain period of time , but it is impossible to write the truth since I have never seen him alive . I can write subjectively and my observations of him through the Internet will be distorted by my own life , experience and surrounding I live in .
Let me introduce one American I got friends with on Facebook .
I like his humor , because he is able to make me smile .
His sensitivity is visible through his carefully chosen words and his decency in his grammatically correct sentences .
I adore his imagination because he is able to kidnap you on a cloud to a never never land .
He is wise and brave , because he was not scared to teach me although he is not a teacher .
He is the man stuck in a generation where loyalty is just a tattoo , love is just a quote and lying is the new truth .
He is the man and I am the woman who live in the world , in which the man wears a short skirt and the woman is as tough as a crocodile .
How come !
I would like to point out another his attribute which is his pride .
When I asked him , if he had read a book The Little Prince by Exupéry because I am feeling like a fox , he asked me in an offended manner , if I know Larry , the comedian .
Kyle is really prideful , but so are all the men .
I do n't believe in the friendship between the man and the woman .
There will always be some kind of sparkling either alluring or repulsing .
Next thing I like about him is that he never pushes me into anything .
So he is thoughtful .
He rose up my own enslaved desires .
All the men are .
In following section I will write about his sexuality and dealing with an argument .
It was easy to draw him into the love affair or to make him horny , but it was quite difficult to start an argument with him . I think that he is a good writer because he is able to describe his sexual dreams and thoughts lively and vividly .
However , ask him a question from his real life and he will give you a one - word answer .
This could hardly satisfy an ordinary questioner like me , not only an interviewer from a daily journal .
I believe he is tender and careful , but impatient and clumsy at the same time .
He forgets of everything when he plunges into his Neverland .
As I wrote before it was not that easy to make the argument with him .
I tried to use different strategic inputs that could help me to argue , for example : You are totally uninterested to read between lines ! You never listen to me!I even called him a lummox and stumblebum .
Yesterday I wanted him to tell me the story of his life .
So I asked him what his favourite sport is .
Kyle is a strong and charismatic individuality and he values his privacy a lot .
And surely , I will .
However , I am not that crazy to marry the man whom I not know in real life .
But I identify myself with his view of male and female relationship .
Yellow the female principle , gentle , cheerful and sensual .
As requested , this is a report concerning the environmental condition within my town .
The information below evaluates the chief measures taken against pollution and environmental damage as well as the population 's interest and involvement in an optimum preservation of the area .
Through a series of programmes and events organised by local voluntary organisations both adults and children are instructed about the importance of waste reduction and recycling .
Since exhaust fumes are considered to be one of the major pollutants nowadays , the local authorities are doing everything in their power in order to induce citizens to travel more by means of public transport , in the detriment of the ubiquitous private cars .
Unfortunately , only a limited number of people are willing to leave their comfort zone for the sake of the community , thus making pollution by dint of heavy traffic a remaining and inextricable problem of our society .
Our local public cleaning services are responsible not only for the efficient removal , storage , collection and transport of waste material , but also for the maintenance and good care of natural areas and green spaces within our community .
The sole purpose of their activity is to keep our town clean and neat , making it an appealing and pleasurable place to inhabit .
Taking everything into consideration , it would be fair to conclude that there are numerous ways in which one can protect the environment and take care of the area in which they reside .
However , as with all issues present within society , a dual commitment from the citizens and authorities should be regarded as a key factor .
If we disturb a fire ant nest they would relentlessly sting us , injecting poison into our body .
Even if we do n't , stinging will cause a burning sensation , swelling and then a blister at the point of sting .
In mild cases , the sting causes itch .
In severe cases it causes nausea , vomiting or dizziness .
In infested areas , they injure livestock , pets and wildlife ; damage crops , plants , electrical equipment , and irrigation systems .
here will be several inventions in the next years .
Moreover , it is a profitable task if they make up new medications to help people suffering from that illness .
It does not fit in rich countries because it concerns to poor countries .
Altogether they provide the nutrients to cover the needs of feeding of one person in one day .
I consider that it could contribute to feeding many people and it could definitely end with the most unfair problem of this world .
There must be something very special about a movie when , after the third time , you 're still getting out of the cimena thinking " I have to see it again " .
Starring Italian comic Roberto Begnini ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) in the main role of Guido , this live loving tragic / comedy it 's about a Jewish father trying to shield his young son from the horrors of the nazims in the Italy of Mussolini .
For that matter Guido creates an imaginariy game for his child once they are deported to a concentration camp .
He tells the boy that they are competing with others to win a tank , so the little Guiosué did n't realise what it 's really going on around him .
The strength of the movie relies on the goofy , loving , eccentric character played by Begnini , his exceptional comic talent and his ability as director to deal with such delicate topic like Nazism while managing to drive through a thick line bettween comedy and drama .
The Original soundtrack created by Nicola Piovanni it 's also a beautiful , delicate plus to this masterpiece .
Life is beautiful was recipient of numerous awards including three Oscars as for best foreign picture , best actor and best original dramatic score .
What strikes me more was that despite the fact that it 's set on the eve of the II world war , the film is n't really about the holocaust but a bittersweet fable about human courage love and hope .
If you already haven't seen it , which I doubt , I highly recommend it ; it will make you laugh out loud but also along the way you 'll find yourself cover in tears , Guarantee .
When I joined the team freshman year , I did n't realize what I was getting into .
See , football is more of a mental sport than anything else , so running on the track was n't only about getting in shape . We would push our minds by running as hard as we could even if we felt like we were going to pass out .
Then after the third game I had a season - ending injury .
Needless to say , I was sidelined for the rest of the season , but this actually helped me realize that since you never know when your last play will be , you should try your hardest in football and life .
After freshman year I decided that I would always give my best effort .
Playing varsity football has taught me so much more than just what my assignments are on a particular play or how to block . I have learned to think about others first , and realized how important working hard is .
The answer , of course , is no , because you can always put it in another gear even if you think you need to give up .
Honestly , I could not agree more , as the website as it is available today is an inconvenient tool providing insufficient informaton .
Second , the theme is outdated , and developing new design can be a good move to attract more clients .
As to other aspects of our website , it might be a good idea to enhance its performance by means of optimizing the code and removing advertisements ( which decrease the website value while bringing little profit ) .
All these tasks can be completed within a month , and I would be glad to be involved in the improvement of our website , as it is an important aspect of our work , because it represents the company , and representation is key when attracting clients is concerned .
Secondly , there are two sorts of schools in Spain - public and private- , which produces a big difference in the educational knowledge .
I obviously agree that nowadays technology is necessary .
So , the schools and the educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach .
Technology does not imply a new instrument to be taught but a new tool and source of knowledge ( if used correctly ) .
In fact , using technology without changing the contents would be a total failure .
Moreover , they should comprise the past information and the new one .
In other words , technology should be used as a tool for the students be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages .
This new technologies also help in the teaching development .
We can make dynamic classes by being in contact with other schools , in the case of subjects such as English and French , students would improve their skills by being in contact with students from different countries .
Also , teachers could replace their methodologies following the best ones and the ones which contribute to have qualified students trained to face everyday life situations .
In conclusion , as a great teacher said , we have 21st century students learning with 20th century tools the 19th century knowledge .
Thus , there must not be a technological revolution but an educational one .
I am writing to express my concern about the smoking ban new law .
At present , I am working for Cafe Noir , a well - known restaurant popular with visitors , many of whom have told me that if such a ban were introduced , they would would not enter into restaurants and instead , they would meet friends at home .
On top that , I think the amount of notice you have given people is unreasonable .
There needs to be much wider public debate , and if a majority agree , they should be given enough time to get used to .
There were not enough police to go round checking any public place .
Secondly , business suffered , with people objecting that they should be given the right to smoke if they wished .
We will talk about a technology that might soon disturb the world .
But first let me explain the process taken to manufacture anything .
The manufacturing process follows three main stages : designing then producing then consuming .
More efficient production means cheaper goods , and by providing them cheaper the consumer now has the ability to purchase more of these goods .
In other words , money would have more value .
So , let 's say , you have $ 100,000 now , you would have $ 10,000,000 fifty years from now .
You then could pay your debt , get a new car , buy a new house , invest or retire , or do just about anything you would do if you currently have $ 10,000,000 in your bank account .
Looking at it through a broader scope , country deficits would be solved , hungry people would be fed , and the homeless would get accommodated .
This is the effect of a reduction in the cost of production ; less production cost allows the producer to reduce the price of his goods while maintaining the initial profit .
Surprisingly , the producer get to maintain his profits due to the proportional decrease in price as well as the cost to produce .
This automatic , efficient , quick , precise technology reduces the amount of labor needed , saves waste initially caused by human errors , saves time and produce at better quality too .
In conclusion , this revolutionary technology has potential to vastly improve the way we manufacture our goods , and in the process of doing that benefit the whole world .
Dogs and cats are called " furkid " not only because their bodies are covered with fur , but also because their hosts regard pets as kids .
I can still recall the day Cathy and I brought Casino to Taipei City Hall , walking him along the department store pavement , and playing with him all day long .
He changed my attitude toward dogs : Casino taught me through his patience and passions .
Ever since I met him , I stopped feeling frighten when facing big dogs , and even started to play with them .

Dear Mrs Kate Ashby ,
I am interested in applying for the job vacancy in the Cafe you run .
The reason for applying is that I believe I would be a perfect candidate as I have plenty of experience in the food business as well as I am highly interested in working for this well - known company .
I strongly believe I would be the right person for the post as I consider myself as polite , well - mannered , enthusiastic and good at dealing with customers .
Besides , working in popular restaurants enabled me to gain the ability to work as part of a team and under pressure , plus learning about a wide variety of international food and dishes .
What is more , I am used to working long hours in both day and night shifts , so busy days will not be a problem for me at all .
Finally , I would like to express my willingness in working for you as this will represent such a great experience for me .
Regarding my level of English , I speak fluent English and got an A on the Cambridge First Certificate Exam .
I also have been helping a nine years old kid with his math homework .
I also love playing sports , such as tennis , soccer , canoeing and kayaking .
I always try so hard to not to go to new restaurants because I do n't like most of them at first .
It was my brother 's birthday so he said if we could go to a new restaurant called Muerde La Pasta .
I 've always Heard about that place so I though it would be okay to go .
It 's a free buffet so you can take everything you want … there are chips , pizza , all types of pasta and then there 's a lot of desserts and there 's no food limit haha .
The staff is so good , they are really helpful and they are always looking if you 've finished to take the dirty dishes away .
Honestly , I thought I would n't like the restaurant but I was completely wrong .. I loved it !
I 'm going with my Friends next week!!I think you get more tan what you pay for like its unlimited food and you only have to pay 10 Euros .
If you did n't go yet , you should definetly do it , I promise you will love it !
You can never really say a thing is worst unless you have indulged yourself in it .
You can never really say a situation is unfortunate unless you have already been to it .
And you can never really say a teacher in the mountain is miserable unless you have experienced being one .
When I knew I would be assigned at Gala National High School , I said it 's the worst thing that ever happened to my career .
When I knew I would be teaching at the remotest high school in Ozamiz , I said I was so unfortunate , and when I knew I would be spending my days in the mountain , I said my life would be miserable .
Indeed , negative vibes filled my thoughts after having known that I was to practice my chosen profession in the place I feared the most .
To have been assigned in the mountain is never a worst situation ; I have never been unfortunate , and misery has never been my colleague .
In fact , being a teacher in the mountain is being the best of who I am , being the most fortunate of men alive , and being the happiest I could ever be .
In here , I have learned more than the lessons I have taught .
It has taught me lessons I could n't have learned had I not been here - the lessons that do not only help me improve my teaching profession but also help me become the right person of my ministry .
I may have been far yet from being an ideal one , but I know someday , having Gala as my guiding light , I can become one .
As to my colleagues , I am grateful to be in a small group of individuals who most of the time shares the same line of interest with me .
We are so small a number , but that does not hinder us to hold any school program and activity at its best .
With our sheer creativity and enthusiasm , we always made it a point that every school activity is worthwhile .
We never settled for any mediocrity .
Together , we aspire for something beyond better .
It 's not all the time that we are in good terms , but we know to ourselves that we care for each other .
And it 's all that matters .
At first , it was an extreme challenge for me to handle students in the mountain .
Every day I got to deal with students wearing different faces of life 's resentment .
As a teacher , it took me much of everything I have to come to terms to every pitiful fate of my students .
Hence , the value of UNDERSTANDING the students even beyond what the meaning of such word can express has been dramatically instilled in me .
And that 's one of the lessons I consider a gem to keep to myself forever .
Students in the mountain have a lot of different untold stories of their lives .
These stories once heard , can open somebody 's heart to learn to love learners despite everything .
That is what exactly happened to me .
As I listened to my students , I have come to realize the very essence of my existence as their teacher .
I may have not perfectly carried out my responsibilities , but I know somehow in my one year stay in Gala , I have made a difference to my students ' lives .
My students have a lot of weaknesses in many aspects of life , but seeing them enduring was motivating me even more to give them good reasons to keep on keeping on .
My dear students may have not known it , but really , they are too the source of my inner strength .
I have more than enough reason to do that - and they are again , my students .
In a nutshell , Gala may have been very far , yet it my heart , it 's just within .
The place , my colleagues , and my dear students are enough testimonies that in Gala I have found a home … and a family to love , really for real .
I am writing to you regarding a job advertisement I saw on yesterday 's newspaper looking for an English - speaking person to work at weekends in your cafe .
I like trying dishes from all over the world and I am keen on cooking experimenting new exotic cuisine .
As a consequence I am prepared to work long hours .
Yours faithfully ,
Dear Sir :
It is not an easy task to explain the importance of this exam for me , since I do not have any specific objective in mind that requires a Cambridge certification .
Similarly , I do not have any study methods in the sense of systematic mechanisms to learn English .
Next I started to read books such as the Harry Potter series and books by George R. R. Martin .
About the reasons to take the test , there is little to say .
As I have said , I have been learning English by the sheer pleasure of it ; but , having come this far , I think it is time to get some kind of formal recognition about my level .
Lots of people think , that teenagers are stupid , have a small knowledge about life , do not have enough experience , are annoying , difficult to understand .
In my opinion we should n't think like that .
I agree that some of young people behave really badly , they smoke , shout on their parents , drink beer , do not improve themselves .
But most of teenagers are even more intelligent than adults or erderly people .
At school , at home they have to cope with lots of problems and try to solve them .
They sometimes have to help their friends or even their parents in difficult tasks like psychical problems , give them tips .
Sometimes it happens that a couple , which has a child in age from 12 - 16 , querls .
Tennagers also have to make serious decisions like choosing secondary school , future job , which way they will go in their life , if they want to be in relationship with someone .
This way you do not only gather plain data but also emotions from people .
Additionally , it happens that while speaking of a particular event suddenly more memories and stories come to the narrator 's mind .
This is an impressive way to document a change over many years , but on the other hand it is challenging to keep photographs in good condition .
For me personally , the best way to collect and record information for future generations is to interview people and to store the information in an appropriate way because of three reasons : Firstly , I have the chance of not getting just one story from a person but maybe two or three more .
Secondly , I can catch the the narrator'semotions .
Thirdly , I do not have to be concerned about loss of qualitiy of photographs and pictures .
When I was in Bali , I had a great night that I always remember .
My husband and me went to a dinner on the beach of our hotel .
The weather was very good and we enjoyed having dinner barefoot , sat on the sand .
When we thouhgt that the night had finished , we had the perfect dessert .
Despite it was very dark , we could see something moving on the sand .
It was lost and could n't find the way to the water .
They turned the turtle and took it to the water , where freed it .
Then the turtle started swimming and disappeared of our sight .
We were very happy because of seeing the turtle and hope to come back to Bali to see it again .
Visiting their own country certainly has its advantages .
In addition , if you plan your vacation very soon , you can also save money on planes or hotels .
In conclusion , I think it 's important to know both their own countries and foreign lands .
It was in August , my parents and my brother were on holiday in Mallorca for a week , and that same day my sister and her boyfriend travelled from Yecla to Paris in a package travel .
At that moment I thought that an accident or a similar something had happened to my family but fortunately it was n't so .
A girl was on the other side of the phone and she told me that my sister and her boyfriend were n't with the other passengers .
It is a fantastic film with beautiful views and an exciting story .
The main character , Walter Mitty , works in a well - known magazine " Life " as a manager of photo negatives .
In his letter he says that one shot from the film is the best picture he has ever made .
Unfortunately , Walter can not find the shot , so he has to look for the traveller which is not easy .
He has to travel to remote parts of the world and have some very amazing adventures .
I wo n't tell you any more as it can spoil the story , but the film is definitely worth watching .
In addition , I can say that I 'm charmed by the main character who is developing throughout the whole film .
If you like complicated stories about dreams and how to make them true , this story is definitely for you .
Free of pocket pain & frequented by the locals , there is a dining gem in Nova Gorica .
You will find there a parking area and some ball courts , and on further exploration , just after the courts & walking towards that famous bridge that you can now see much better , a restaurant .
For seasonal food served by obliging & good humoured waiters , you will find nowhere better .
In summer that boiler of dark liquid beside the entrance might be Kopriva chai , a summer herbal digestif , favoured by the villagers of the region , or you might be offered a world war one menu such as soldiers may have eaten in this area .
Day , date and season dictate the ever interesting & changing menu at this restaurant .
The warm interior is the perfect place to eat in winter , while in summer , many diners prefer the exterior tables beside the turquoise Soca river .
One of Slovenia 's qualified somnelliers will help you choose from the good wine cellar , so this is the place where I recommend our class can relax , eat , drink well & enjoy the happy atmosphere .
The film is set in France in nineteenth century .
The idea lying behind the story is that justice and law are not the same thing .
The main character , Jean Valdjean , played by Hugh Jackman , is jailed for stealing a loaf of bread , in a try to avoid his nephew 's death .
Then after being left free , he become a thief again , however this time he is not condemned because of a prier .
But do not worry I am not going to spoil the ending .
All it occurs during the first part of the film .
All in all I think that it is one of the best films ever made .
Cars are improving , becoming safer and environment friendlier .
A lot of effort has been put into reducing the fumes , etc .
Moreover , people have become more aware of the environment protection .
Thus , more and more people , when buying a new car , also consider its environmental friendliness and the possible impact on the community .
Also , cars get more affordable in many countries .
For example , in India nd China the technological advances have enabled them to mass produce really affordable cars , which are also imported .
However , there might be still room for public transport in future , especially in big cities .
Although I do n't quite like watching soap operas , I was started watching this particular show with my family .
My mother likes watching soap operas on tv and she got me hooked onto this new tv show - iknmp .
The show looked promising through its promos , which were based on a very famous old hindi song .
The lead actors were well known tv stars .
The couple have 4 kids and after separation , 2 kids live with their mom and 2 with their dad .
The dad , who is a cardiologist moves to US and starts a new life there .
The mom on the other hand decides to stay back and works hard to give her children a decent life .
The show starts with the eldest daughter , who lives with her mother trying to contact her father to ask him to be a part of her wedding ceremony .
The father who had vowed to never look back at first ignores her requests , however , upon insistence from his other children and his sister agrees to go back to India .
Although not very practical , the show is fun to watch as it brings out the Indian values and at the same time teaches the importance of women being independent and able to lead life on their own .
Innovative entrepreneurship can be perceived as a special process of creating , testing and implementing of the new products and materials , the new way of resource utilization and the new kind of management in business process to find advanced opportunities for ( non)commercial use .
The first test has shown that I am very motivated and my skills almost fit to the possibility to be an entrepreneur .
It is important to underline that the driving factors ( motivation ) determine behaviour of entrepreneur and show the reasons for acting .
In the test were accessed the answers and I was found out as a person that has high control appeal meaning that I have great leading skills and a need to organize and to moderate .
In the motivation part I also received high score in need of challenges as I prefer to take difficult projects because I believe that they might develop my knowledge and abilities .
Moreover , it is really important for me to be own boss even though it needs much more responsibilities .
Nevertheless , in the test I received fewer points in " need for achievement / success " than it was required for being an entrepreneur .
As I found out there were two problems about lack of points .
The first one was based on profit orientation of the entrepreneur in the test .
The above - mentioned situation means that during the assessment were not taken into account other goals that entrepreneur might have .
For instance , it can be the social sustainability and a need to develop the local employment situation or an entrepreneurship as a hobby / lifestyle .
The second problem was based on essential role of getting a feedback .
However , the test evaluated as important feedback parents and friends opinion and I do not agree that it might be essential unless they are specialists in that field .
Nevertheless , I might take a reasonable risk in case it can positively influence business .
I 'm not going to spend a lot of money for a ticket , because I 'm studying so I just have a part - time job .
If we check the prices of air travel , we can be disappointed as well as of travel by boat .
Fortunately the train tickets are cheaper .
Plane flies very quickly , but you have to be at the airport at least an hour earlier .
Travelling by train is quite fast , and pleasant , I can safely travel to more places worldwide than people taking a boat or plane transport .
After the summary is to certify that travelling by train is the most advantageous , but the most important reason why I chose journey by train a fact that I have a motion sickness , and I 'm afraid to fly .
At the end of a decade in which technology has made enormous leaps , I am thinking about how much present vision of house will change in the future .
Despite many differences in the human nature , the present houses do not differ so much between themselves .
On the other hand , recently , more often many new and more advanced projects are realized by daring architects .
But can you imagine that in the near , unspecified future all homes will be like that ?
Built by using the most modern technology , full of the latest inventions which man can create ?
Of course , for people to live better , but it would be useful to modern houses to be constructed so as to do not damage the environment .
I think quite few scientists still surprise us , and the house of the future will go beyond the limits of our imagination .
There has been major changes regarding the teaching approach in the last few years , but there is still room for improvement .
If we focus on the teaching of English as a foreign language , we possibly could see this more clearly .
In the early 1980s the activity in the classroom was focused on grammar .
However , speaking , listening activities and the massive use of I.T mark the schedule nowadays .
The new teaching approach is based on how students can effectively use the language rather than on the knowledge of the language they actually have .
This new outlook on the teaching procedures consists of the use of the so called alternative assessment as a way to evaluate learners ' skills .
A grammar test shows knowledge about the language , whereas alternative assessment shows learners ' ability to efficaciously use the language in the context of a real situation .
There are many reasons for using alternative assessment techniques : learners demonstrate things learned , take responsibility , motivation may increase and they have the opportunity to use language for actual purposes .
It is important to notice that the difficulty to carry out the changes towards the new teaching approach- referred to above- lies not with the students themselves but with the old generation of teachers , since they sometimes have trouble applying the new outlook on education methods .
In conclusion : The way of teaching is changing in the last few years all over Spain .
The main reason for that could be found by overlooking the matters related to new teaching methods developed recently .
However , a smooth transition to the new approach is still necessary to overcome the massive education - related challenges Spain will have to face in the upcoming years .
In the year 2020 there was conflict between Japan and the United states .
The conflict was due to trend creation , citizens between both countries wanted to see who created better and bigger trends .
Law enforcers also wanted for their country to win , and in the United States policemen arrested any Japanese person they saw and sent them back to Japan .
Once the day was over , the Japanese government tried to reverse all of the damages done , but it was impossible .
Japan asked the United states for help , they gladly agreed , and they dragged Japan back up to their normal status .
Japan launched a counter attack and enslaved the United States , and then proceeded to conquer the world .
A new era was created , it was the most brutal time period in the history of mankind , it was known as many things most people named it " The Japan Era " , but it was so brutal that the official name was " The Dark Yellow Era "
I would like to recommend the following movie : " The perfume " .
This movie can be considered a classical thriller , but with several aspects that makes it unique in this gender .
First of all , the historical period is the victorian age in France .
Landscapes are really wonderful .
The buildings , dresses , and habits of population are displayed in full detail .
Secondly , we have and amazing script that can be considered unique .
The story tell us the importance of the perfume in all aspects of our lifes .
The movie 's main plot describes the early years of our starring , a poor orphan , which takes advantage of his powerful smell sense to find out new jobs .
Finally we will discover a fantastic ending that we would never imagine through the movie watching .
The overall rate of this movie is really high and it is a movie to remember forever .
Nevertheless this is not an all audiences movies , because it contains hard scenes not suitable for children .
If people can rent this movie or watch it online I would encourage watch it as fast as possible .
Many people believe that public transport will be replaced by private one in the nearest future .
The main reason is the convenience of travelling by cars in comparison with using public transport .
Apart from that , there are many other benefits in buying a car instead of using buses or underground every day .
First of all , an automobile gives such a valuable thing as privacy .
For example , driving a car we can wear whatever we want and listen to the music on any volume .
If the car is large enough , it can be even a perfect place for sleep .
Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find any quiet and pleasant place outside the city .
Public transport can take us just to certain locations .
Thus , it is clear that private transport such as automobiles has plenty of advantages .
On the other hand , we can stuck with different problems while travelling by car .
For instance , staying in traffic jams always steals much our precious time .
It means that travelling by cars can even be more dangerous than using public transport .
Generally , bus drivers are much more experienced than automobile ones , therefore , accidents caused by public transport happen quite rarely .
Thus , I would argue that driving a car requires much attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can make a serious damage to other people .
After that , she dressed up and went to the kitchen to make a breakfast .
After aeting delicious salad and drinking tea , she went to her room to do her hair and put the make - up on .
Anna was a bit stressed , but she was sure , that everything will be alright .
She came down and opened the door - it was her mother .
They hugged and smiled to each other .
She came in and noticed that her daughter is a little nervous , so she decided to make a coffee , sit and talk for a while .
As they were talking , Anna 's best friends came up .
After some time friends came down and told Anna 's mother , that she is ready and she is going to come in a while .
Her mum came to her and hugged her really affectionately . "
One also learns to work hard and disciplined in order to achieve success .
All these points led to me playing basketball for almost thirty years now and I 'm still hooked by it .
If someone would ask me for advice on how to start playing basketball , I would probably suggest starting with a trial practise and if the person enjoys it , he / she can join the club .
Is situated in the city center , near the seaport .
It is a different kind of restaurant , because you can find not only the typical Spanish food , also dishes from different parts of the world .
What I like most of this restaurant is that it offers healthy and balanced food , the flavor is fantastic , the food very tasty and carefully cooked .
You can enjoy original food , good quality on a budget .
On the other hand the surroundings are modern , the place is airy and cosy .
The waiters are very welcoming and informative so you feel very comfortable .
In my opinion the salad is the best option , with a big range of types from different countries .
Finally I really recommend this restaurant , especially for couples or friends that want to try something different and newfangled .
Unfortunately we did n't get the chance to see each other that night .
During two hours I served drinks .
At the end of the evening I worked at the parking lot .
All in all a great experience ! You can rely on my help next year !

Canada is a nation built of citizen - soldiers .
His death shocked a nation .
I am aged 44 , of Austrian nationality , married and hold the Cambridge English Advanced certificate since last summer .
I am also experienced with children , having looked after my sister 's daughters aged 9 , 11 and 14 for years now .
Whenever possible I take the girls out for a swim or a ride on their bikes .
It is also a good idea to play badminton and minigolf with them .
Further , I worked as an au - pair in France and Canada , where I watched over 3 , respectively , 2 children .

There 's nothing like share a meal with local people , it offers you the possibility to glean from someone who lives in the place .
The wedding of my niece was celebrated in Barcelona last weekend .
First of all , my mother , my children , my partner and I took the train in Zaragoza to go to Barcelona .
When we arrived in Barcelona we went by taxi to the hotel , which my brother had previously booked , and there we met with other relatives : my brother , his wife , my nephews and of course my niece ( the bride ) .
We all went together to have lunch to a nearby restaurant .
The marriage ceremony took place at a wonderful church , there were flowers everywhere , live music , three hundred guests and of course , the bride and the bridegroom , the most beautiful and happy couple I have ever seen as far as I can remember .
The party was held in a large garden near the bridegroom 's fathers ' house .
The dinner was a three main course meal which had been carefully chosen by the new couple .
The party continued with a splendid dancing until seven in the morning .
If you are wealthy , or you come from a family where your father can provide you with most of the things you want , I suggest going to college straight away will be a good idea .
Some of us are afraid to travel because of the newborn cases of ISIS .
Mass shooting , bombs , hacking into security system can happen any time , any day .
However , for those who really need to fork out money to pay college loans , it is best for them to take a year off and work part time at a cafe , or somewhere remotely interesting .
It is wise for them to find some time to save some money so they would not need to struggle during college .
However , some just want to have some fun , after years in high school , after so many years of break ups , after so many years of eating cafeteria food , it is time to find some enjoyable time with quality friends and with mouth - watering food .
In their minds , it is all about having fun but is it really what it is ?
What if they changed into some monster they can not suppress ?
One day in the post , I had an argument with a man who studied in the same university as me , and I challenged him to fight with me : I thought it would solve the problem between us .
After that he told the teacher who was responsible for that class , and called me into her room and asked me questions .
This story tells us that sometimes we can not control ourselves , but we should be alone and think positively or take a deep breath , and these will make us calm down .
Hi , my name is Priscila and I just realized that I am a writer , too .
That was the first time my work was assessed by the way I wrote in English .
Because of my work , I have to write all the time to my students , to my colleagues and to the academic community in general .
I expect that this course will help me develop my English skills , so that I can write my papers , communicate and discuss my research in more effective way .
In modern world , public transport become less important as travelling by car is said to be more convenient . Travelling by car also reduces their time of journey and they do n't need to wait for a particular bus .
It may also because as people are getting richer they do n't need to go for a public transport as more comfortable option is always there waiting for them .
The world is moving faster and everyone has to be fast enough to compete with this modern world .
While comparing the drawbacks of public transport with modernized vehicles , public transport may not seems to be a better choice .
Although the maintenance cost of car is quite expensive , it does not stop people from using cars since convenience matters to them the most and not money .
Many people think that public transport is only for poor and not for rich .
If it continues , no resource will be spared for the future generation .
Nowadays , many people around the globe are trying to acquire a second language , when it comes to decide between learning in our own country versus learning abroad , we can find several pros and cons that might get us fairly confused .
To sum up , the best way of learning English , or rather the best place to do it depends on each person 's means and learning style , but definitely it is possible to acquire a second language both at home and abroad .
People try to skip Good Friday because , there is no feasts in that day .
Moreover , it is the sombrest day in a year , which recalls people the Crucifixion caused by people 's sins .
People prefer to meet happiness and positive thinking then talking about a death and a suffering .
Accordingly , the author compares the Easter to a pagan spring festival , where people were joyful because of spring coming just as a Christians 's cheerfulness of the Resurrection .
People choose pleasant entertainments instead of talking about a death , a suffering and a self - sacrifice .
Everyone is individual and worries about themselves , because it is easier way to live .
Above all , people are not used to undergo suffering and what is more brutal death .
4 . The author mentions the origin of the word ' compassion ' , in order to remind people the meaning of that word .
It refers to ' suffer with ' .
Nevertheless , people make this compassion tided away , because it is too painful for them to stand that .
Not only they run away from uncomfortable situations but they also prefer to see them on screens .
My school friends and me went to Dominican Republic , it 's a Caribbean country with amazing beaches .
I remember we got there the first of October on a Saturday night , and I will never forget the rush of warmth I felt as soon as I stepped out of the plane .
When we got to the resort we all checked in and went to our designated rooms . I was sharing a room with my friend Emily .
After unpacking we left our room to see the rest of the resort .
Since Television was first invented , it has influenced different aspects of people 's lives .
Since Television was launched to the market it has acquired other purposes besides entertaining , such as communicating and advertising , that is way the possibility of it having educational purposes has been widely discussed .
Television can certainly educate , it has great potential for doing so because of the way it presents information and the scope of people it can achieve .
Television can educate in several ways , to mention some : by providing and extending information given in certain curses at school , and by providing information that is not even taught at school .
It is very exciting that entertainment and education can be merged for accomplishing the spread of knowledge along the masses in an enjoyable way .
Television series , contests , movies , and news which do it all the time without us being aware of it .
I am writing regarding the advertisement on USA SUMMER CAMPS .
I found this advertisement on the newspaper and I would like to state the reasons why I think I am suitable for the job at hand .
The groups I was in charge of mostly consisted of people from ages 6 to 12 , although I once had the chance to work with a group of young adults as well .
Everywhere I have worked before I have been praised for being very organised and having the ability to deal with unexpected situations successfully .
Usually , I do n't have much time to spend on myself since I am always occupied with something .
I have taken part of a basketball team since the age of 5 and I have recently become a young ladies ' group 's coach .
I did that for three summmers and I still help out at my parents ' restaurant when a hand is in need .
I would really appreciate it if you could take my application into account .
I am writing in response to your advertisement which I saw in the International Newspaper to apply for the job in the USA Summer Camps .
This year , I have finished my degree in Mathematics in the University of Zaragoza and in September , I will start to study to become in teacher .
I also have studied English language for ages and I consider that I have a good level .
Moreover , this job would be an excellent experience to improve my English and be more selfconfident .
As for my experience , I love working with children and I sometimes took care of my nieces which they are 10 years old .
My degree took up all my free time during this year , however , I tried to go on doing sport , especially running and playing football . I also try to keep up with the latest trends in sports events .
I describe myself as a sociable , responsible , trustworthy and hardworking person which likes working with children .
My favorite sport is Football , but it is not a sport that I like to practise it 's a sport to watch because it 's beautiful , very cool and very exciting to support a team in a championship .
I am Brazilian , and as almost everybody in my country , I 'm a big football fan .
The World Cup is happening now in my country Brazil .
I love it when this event happens , so many incredible games going on , best players of the world , three games per day at the start , and with very good looking players .
I do n't know what exactly happens but in every World Cup the atmosphere changes , everybody gets happier , Mc Donalds launches the tastiest hamburgers , people go out to watch games with friends in bars or they meet in somebody 's house .
I love the World Cup despite the fact that it being in Brazil has brought a lot of political problems , or just show us how corrupt our government can be with the huge overpriced projects , a lot of money that has been spent on unfinished stadiums , with shameful delays in their construction , etc .
I love the World Cup , however i certainly would have preferred if it had been in another country .
Also it helps you to release the daily stress and is a good motivator .
You start walking 10 minutes each day , then for 20 minutes and you can add more minutes till start running for 30 minutes and then for an hour .
In winter , you need to put on heavy clothes , while in summer lighter clothes , a hat and pair of glasses will be all you need .
In winter I go to run for half an hour in the afternoons , but in summer I go out and run in the mornings and in the afternoons to enjoy the nice weather .
Being a person that loves sports , it is hard for me to see gaining pounds through the years .
Once I decided that I needed to do something , I started walking around my place .
I was still out of breath sometimes , but I kept doing it because I wanted to achieve my goal to lose 10 pounds .
And now I am running 4 miles a day .

Scout ( Jean Louise ) Finch is a round character .
Her outter look seems like a little girl .
Talking from the outter look , one can easily see that Scout is not " the usual " girl .
Scouts character is kind of a tomboy .
She does not like to dress like a lady even when aunt Alexandra tries to make a lady out of her , Scout refuses to dress or speak like one .
In young age , before she went to school , she started reading .
Her intelligence in young age was a Problem for her teacher Miss Caroline , because never had such a well - educated pupil before .
Instead of celebrating it , she somhow inhibits Scouts learning .
Due to that Scout gets bored and starts to hate school .
Furthermore Scout often reacts very impulsive , mostly in young age .
Also when she had trouble with her cousin , because she called Atticus a " nigger - lover " Scout beats her up .
For her it is a method to make her mind clear .
Later on Scout begins to understand , not least because of her father and brother , that it is important to think before talking .
Somehow she reverts back to her old ways .
To conclude Scout is a smart girl with two sides .
On the one hand Scout acts very impulsive and is an obstreperous tomboy but on the other hand she is very clever and more adult than others in her age .
So you need information about my country 's eating customs ?
On weekdays , Dutch people take their breakfast , which usually consists of a few sandwiches , somewhere between 7.00 and 8.00 a.m. In the weekend , we tend to sleep in and therefore take our breakfast a bit later .
The most important ones are probably hotchpotches : mashed potatoes and vegetables , often combined with smoked sausage .
A traditional Dutch meal which I think is far more tasty , consists of little thick pancakes , served warm with melted butter and icing sugar .
In a few hours time , I can get to some far - away destination .
Boats trips are long and boring .
In today 's intercultural world , one of the best assests people and nations can have is tolerance and a deep appreciation of cultural values different from their own .
However , it is probably a truism that reading about or watching films about a country are only pale subsitutes to actually going to visit a place and experiencing the differences yourself .
People started emerging from their houses , their faces stoned with fear .
But there was only one who knew what and where that explosion had occurred .
Just a day before Michael was arguing with his friends that Rasheed was a very nice guy .
So what if he originated from the Arab peninsula , that does not implicate that he is a terrorist .
He has been living in the U.K for the past 20 years .
But this act was out of question .
This was something that could not be argued upon .
Not knowing what would be the intellectual thing to do , the first thing that came to his mind was calling the police .
Sprinted towards what seemed like flames , only to find Rasheed standing across it , blood protruding from his right hand .
Knowing that he had jeopardized his friendship with Rasheed he quietly returned to his house .
Whenever there is a possibility to buy a new item , one should follow it .
Shopping became the way of life for some people , who find it as a hobby as well as pleasant activity .
Sufficient to say , buying new items may be viewed as a waste of time .
Often , it turns out , that purchase should not take place at all , the reason being lack of money .
Likewise , the joy of shopping is dependent upon the items one intend to purchase .
Obviously , shopping for food is not equivalent to purchasing garments .
The article " Stairways to Heaven : Gothic Architecture , Heavy Metal , and the Aesthetics of Transcendence " is an unparallelled one in terms of the discussion it evokes .
The author starts his discussion by discussing his particular passion for the Gothic architecture , and this passion is rather vivid throughout the entire article .
In order to explain the nature of the Gothic architecture and its major aspects , the author efficiently employs the musical analogies .
One of the major arguments in the article is the comparison between Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal Rock music .
Bork believes this very comparison to be an efficient one , as it employs the parallels that are easily understandable for a wider audience due to the utilization of simple terms that they can relate to .
Furthermore , he finds that there are many similarities between the development of Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal Rock music .
For example , the purpose of both is to induce awe and , they both employ the concepts of distortion ( Bork 1 ) .
What is more , these styles usually tend to abandon the classical tendencies , and both rose in a response to a new demand in the culture .
The number of people accessing public transport far outweighs the number of people the transport system was designed to handle .
The trains and buses are crowded , and newer routes and not reflecting the changing demand .
Mass production has made cars more affordable to the middle class in recent years .
Both these factors have led to increased purchase of cars over the last few years .
This trend is likely to continue in the near future .
Cars have the ability to take you from your home to your place of work , without any stopovers .
Further , after you board off the train , you again have to find your way to your destination by either walking or using another mode of transport .
She took a heavy sigh of relief as all the panic was finally over for her !
Her cherry red face glistened vigorously in the golden brown sunset like a perfectly baked pastry , as the last of the sun 's rays beamed down over the horizon .
Spring is a good season because it is between winter and summer , temperatures are not too cold and not to hot .
You can walk and smell the flowers beginning to flourish .
Summer is great because it 's time to hang up your shoes and relax .
When you drive by the neighborhoods you notice that families are all gathered in some kind of celebration .
That is why I am writing this letter , to make you know what is happening in the city and to tell you that the police are not doing their job .
I would also like you to talk to the police department , because the police have to do their job and make sure we are all safe , not to ignore us and say that everything is fine when everything is wrong .
I had never felt so nervous ... I looked in the audience , everyone was looking at me .
On the left side I saw my parents , okay , inhale , exhale , I can do this .
I have always dreamed of this , being a musical star on broadway .
I conpeted in singing competitions when I was younger and I took acting classes .
I arrived in New York a four months ago .
When I was taking a walk through the neighbourhood I saw this poster about the musical wicked and they were looking for someone to play the lead .
Of course I took this opportunity and two weeks later I had to do audition .
I felt like I messed up but the next day I got a call that I got the role .
And finaly , the moment was there , the opening night .
I put on my costume and walked on stage , I had to wait untill I opened the curtains .
Many people still consider television only as a way to relax , get entertained and stop thinking about all the problems that might worry them .
As it is a very common phenomenon between teenagers , schools should show them that television also enables you to learn something new .
A clear example is that watching television in another language is of vital importance if you aim to learn new vocabularies or improve your comprensive skills , and it makes studying a language really fun and enjoyable .
Had I choose whether considering television educational or not , I would definitely say it is .
Nevertheless , we should use it in an appropriate way and be careful about what is the sources of the information told during a tv show , as they might be misleading .
I 'm sure that you wo n't be disappointed with town I live in because there is a lot to see !
I 'm really into showing you all the interesting places around .
To my mind , you 're probably totally exhausted because of travel and those few first days when you had to get to know new surroundings .
So , as you asked me , I 'll give you proposal of an interesting place to visit where you could take a rest and relax .
Kachl 's Park is a perfact place to spend some time walking along paths , sitting on a bench , talking to each other .
In the public garden there are two ponds ( really nice place to sit and admire landscape ) , an antique wooden church , a swimming pool .
There is also quite big concert hall where , if you have luck , you can enjoy some interesting concerts ( in general for free ) .
I think it 'll be perfect place where you can spend some free time .
I can show you around the place and tell a bit more about the city .
Write to me back as soon as you decide when you want to go to the park . I 'll go with you with a pleasure .
when I saw your advertisement I instantly thought that I would like to work in one of your summer camps .
Since I used to work as a secretarian I feel capable of organizing sports and evening activities , if you choose to let me do so .
Even though cooking is not my favorite chore I would n't mind to work in the kitchens .
After this short description of myself I would just like to say that I have only heard good things about your summer camps from my relatives in the U.S. , so it would be my pleasure to work for you .
I am writing to you with concern about the U - turns your party have made in broke promises .
We believe none of the promises your party made were brought into action .
It was said you would stand up for elderly and ill people but nothing had changed .
Security against terrorism atacks were promised to be step up but policemen are not seen in the streets and neither are security cameras .
People were counting on this party to increase public expenditure , but pension 's money have stayed the same .
One of the most disappointing topics is that you played down the situation we are living and the necessities people has .
We were told this party would speak out against corruption , but now it is your own policy , and promises seem they were a bad joke .
We look forward this letter will make you back down and apologize to the ones that vote for your lies .
People are noticing your promises are not going to be made and I am sure there will be plenty of people complaining about the lack of true in your promises .
Therefore , the first chapter features Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott , a high - flying counter - terrorism officer , who is recruited to AC-12 after refusing to collude with his colleagues in the cover - up of a failed operation in which a man was mistaken shot by another cop .
He 's one of AC-12 's leading investigators although he sometimes has the tendency to let his personal feelings sways his professional judgement .
Fleming plays his partner 's part , an AC-12 's undercover specialist , who prides herself on being the consummate professional , unmoved by emotional considerations .
Both of them share superior , Hastings , who remains the ethically upstanding senior investigating officer ; zealous and suspicious , not being everyone 's cup of tea .
Even though being widely recognised for his impeccable ethical standards , he hides a drastic change in his personal circumstances .
With calculated precision , the plot hatches a story where there are no goodies and baddies , and throws in a few twists and turns that makes your mouth drop -indeed , Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates has adopted a set of particular ethics principles and nevertheless , he 's adored by his loyal team , has got a nice family and has recently been awarded " Officer of the Year " .
To conclude , those who ultimately felt miserable after the end of the spellbinding second season need not worry ; line of Duty writer Jed Mercurio has been commissioned by the BBC to write third and fourth series and if you haven't tried it before , you 've just about got time to catch up .
Were you a UK tourist coming to Switzerland for a short weekend break fifteen years ago you would have found yourself in a situation that no shops would have Sunday opening hours .
I clearly remember bringing milk and bread over from Heathrow in Sunday morning !
Now you can shop on Sundays although your shopping spree still will be limited to Zurich railway station and the airport , not to mention some limited choice of simple foods at occasional motorway services .
But it is an improvement to say the least !
Although the size of an average supermarket in Switzerland will still remind you of a medium size village shop , there has been improvement there as well !
We can see now international brands we are used to in the UK .
But the prices will shock and surprise you , they double or triple the UK ones .
If you have strong neves , do your window shopping in Bahnhofstrasse in Zürich .
You can find the same stuff in Italy at half price !
Sarah was not exactly the coolest girl in the school but she came anyways , thinking that maybe for once she would be accepted in their group ... but no one was to be seen behind that window .
Sarah could have never imagined that the sneaky boys were hidden inside the abandoned house waiting for her entrance with eggs and tomatoes in their hands , ready to smash them onto her face .
She was just about to open the door to check the inside when suddenly a scream echoed from the house , the door slammed open and the group started running at full speed chased by four big spiders who just discovered that their home had just been occupied .
I guess that what goes around comes around !
" she shouted to them with a smile on her face , with this story to tell she will finally shut those boys ' mouths at school .
Usuallly he was energetic , full of confidence , ready to party .
But she had no intention to give up .
She had fought to hard for this life and she would not let their long - standing relationship to be ruined just like that .
By accident he thought .
Accident which had been well prepared by her .
He was not stupid but you could not expect any perls of wisdom from him .
He had never worked but they had been living in a 40-room house with a huge garden and so many servants that she could not remembered their names .
They had never worried about money - all bills were paid by his trust found .
" Are you having a mistress?",she asked one morning when they were having breakfast .
" How could you even say that ? I would never ever do this to you . "
At that moment he was like a bear with soar head .
She wanted answers and to have them he needs to be alive not dead of heart attack .
" What is going on than ? And do not lie to me ! You have always been a very bad liar ! "
" We are broken .
Every morning I went to the port and unshipped .
Nobody there knows me so you should be afraid that some of our friends would recognise me .
Nobody will never know that we are poor now " .
This should be some kind of joke .
" We can move to smaller house or fired some of the servants ? "
And where I would put my wine collection ? I would rather work as a porter than live in a 20-room house "
They definitely had different idea of poverty .
But before clearing that she wanted to ask one more important question :
Since he was a little boy people around he knew that this child had a strange character .
He was really moody and he could move from extreme happiness to the most absolute sadness in a few seconds .
When he grew up he struggled to pass his illness and he became a sane , strong , handsome young adult man .
However all people in his neighborhoor feared him because of his past .
Therefore , he decided that he was going to meet new people for beginning a new life .
At the age of twenty years he achieved a job as a personal trainer where he earned enough money to rent a flat .
In this way , he moved to his new neigborhood where everybody respected him .
One day he fell in love with one of his female customers .
She was a beautiful , blond , tall , Polish girl called Magda who worked as an architect in a studio in the center of London .
Their relationship had been excellent since first time that they had met each other and two months later they decided to become lovers .
Slowly he became illness one more time .
Although he had been trying to hind this , his personal problems were ovbious and Magda did n't feel well with him .
Finally their relationship broke up and Michael fell in his illness deeper than ever .
Three months later Magda was walking with her new boyfriend and Michael saw them , he was totally insane and jealous , he caught an enormous stick from the nearest tree and he beat them as strong as he could .
The young couple of lovers fell on the floor and Michael got away to his home .
His insane evil mind go away until his flat .
At that moment everything changed , he reminded his childhood , his recovery and his sane life , then Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
In my opinion public transport is doomed , because travelling by car is much more convenient and at the same time the easiest way to reach any destination you wish to get to .
People have to sit next to other people they do n't know for a long time , in other words , you may be sitting next to suspicious passengers .
On the other hand travelling by car allows you to establish your own pace , even when you travel to a place you do not know so well .
This means you can set the time you want to leave , because you do not have to respect a specific timebable .
This way you will have the chance to have more relaxing journey through the countryside , traffic will not be so intense and aggressive , and finally you can plan the time you want to arrive , using a GPS or other technolology to help you plan your journey .
To sum up , travelling by public transport can be advantageous when you travel inside a town , but when you have to travel outside your specific territorry , nothing is better than a car .
Michael has been working very hard , and just seemed to really be over whelmed by all the work he had been carrying out through the course of the month .
Well on this particular morning , Michael seem to be getting along quite well , he appeared to be energetic and very vibrant that particular morning .
His attention to detail appeared to be trust worthy and correct , and normally his attention to detail is not something that is challenged because of how reliable he is .
Well as the day was coming to a close Michael had a distinct feeling that something just was n't correct but he dismissed that feeling and continued with his day as he usually does .
Well the days responsibilities in Michael 's mind had been successfully accomplished and he felt really confident about all he had accomplished .
Needless to say Michael could n't have been any more deceived than he had realized , because the unfortunate thing is that when he was doing his walk through on all of his department the inventory that was supposed to be submitted was in fact inaccurate .
Because after Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
You sounded really stressed in your last email and I am worried about it .
Are things getting better today ?
I know you are under a lot of pressure because of your final exams and I can really understand how you are feeling right now , buried in a mountain of books and notes , with no free time for other things or just relax .
I 've passed for all this thing .
Do n't you remember how you cheer me up when things could n't get any worse ?
Nothing is worth than getting stressed out about .
If you can study in short bursts and take some breaks , you 'll be by far more efficient in your studies than slogging away for hours on end .
Think of it !
Another thing that it helped me a lot was doing regularly sport near home .
Jogging or going out for a walk helped me to boost energy levels and to clear my mind .
I think it 's very useful - and right now I sound like your Mom - is eating properly .
Try to eat fresh food , such as salads , tons of fruit and you 'll feel better .
Take care and do n't let it you down !
Considering all this , nowadays it is socially important a development in positive values among young people such as respect and tolerance to create honest adult people .
The 21st century has given a new meaning to the word Friendship .
From what evolved as a comradeship between 2 people based on acquaintance , mutual interest and companionship it has moved forth to relationships where people have not even met one another physically .
In the past friends were made when peopleet each other , other than of course pen friends .
Today with technology friends are made at a click of a key be it on social media or mobile devices .
Today with the BFF concept one has a best friend at every nook and corner for different purposes .
Friendship stood the test of time and grow stronger with disagreements fights and misunderstanding , all being resolved and forgotten in the name of friendship .
Today friendships are take take take and very few stand the test of time .
Friendship today is friend or friends for each season and reason while friendship of the past has been whatever the situation or time a friend stands through .
However , this does n't mean that my parents , especially when I was a child , always told me " yes " and made me do whatever I wanted to .
On the contrary , I grow up with many " no " , and I do not always agree with them in different situations .
But they taught me all the important values and good manners , and I 'm grateful to them for this .
For nowadays I see around me kids who are pleased in everything by their parents : they buy them whatever they want , and behave as " friends " .
I believe that this 's wrong , because by doing so they 're not doing their well .
This does n't mean that parents should keep themselves distant from their son ; on the contrary , a son should talk to his family , asking for advice or just to confront each other , because communication is at the base of relationships of every kind .
I just think that each of us in our life plays a role , and that doing parents is not an easy job , but they should try to do their best .
The Miracle resort Bangkok ,
The miracle is an extraordinarily large resort .
Counting 33 stories in the main building it could be the biggest resort in Bangkok
The resort mainly focuses on children , which is in my eyes a good idea .
The focus on children can be found in the huge contribution the Kids Club has on the daily life in the hotel .
You can find Kids Club 's Members everywhere in the hotel , except for your room .
The hotel handles privacy very well and I can guess most of the guests will appreciate it .
A more compact building would be more appreciated by most of the people .
Finding a new job has become a tough task for all the people who have just finished their studies .
Our plan is to go to Birmingham with my cousin Daniel who has been living there for 3 years and to stay with him just the time we need until we can find a job and a place to spend there tree months because we must return in October .
I think that it would be quite easy for Montse to find a job but I am quite worried about my opportunities .
If I am lucky I would apply for an interesting job , but I think that I will apply for a normal job such as barman , working on a factory , etc .
I hope that this adventure goes well because we are very excited and it would be useful in order to find a job when we come back to Spain .
You can tell because eyerybody looks at her like she is some crazy murdering kid .
Most of the students at Laura 's new school do not talk to her they are a little bit too cautious about interacting with her .
Frustrated Laura accepted her new life of solitude outside of the secret society of the others .
And she thought that this is her chance to get in , to be one of them .
He has not spoken one word to Laura but she followed him around since the incident .
One day when she walked him home she said : Okay , I give up !
If nobody talks to me than none of you have the right to judge me .
I do n't want to be a part of your life because if you act like that without knowing me than you do not deserve my attention .
He thought that this was very brave but he had not enough confidence to tell her that .
This TV series is presented by Netflix , an online service that allows its subscribers to view any TV Show , anywhere , and in any device .
The series provides an unorthodox view into the lives of eight people that are connected by some sort of magical spirit .
This connection allows them to see through each other eyes , and even control each other movements .
This decision made the series extraordinary , with scenes recorded in Seoul , Nairobi , San Francisco , Mumbai , London , Berlin , Mexico and Chicago .
To sum up , I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in science - fiction , but also to anyone curious about different cultures as " Sense8 " provides an unseen view into the lives of eight very different characters , their surroundings , religion , and traditions .
To be honest , in the questionnaire you send , I could give a positive response to the most of the questions but I do n't consider myself a code expert .
In JavaScript I have some experience but not in the necessary quality that is required for such a position , I think .
Like I told you , I 'm a web graphic designer , among other , focused more in design and my usage of code is very limited .
If I have to , I search the web for information and implement it but it requieres time .
Perhaps is there some chance of acquiring knowledge during the development of the activity .
About my CV you have , it is up to date and you can keep it , maybe you have some new offer that patches better with my profile .
The Food Network has become my favourite channel I can tune to it the whole day !
It 's so relaxing and very informative , I never get bored .
Cooking shows are fun to watch , but my most favourite shows are those about cakes and pastries .
I really enjoy baking that I often buy books about it .
Cheesecake for me is the simplest yet most sophisticated cake there is .
Recently , I spent a week in Switzerland as a part of a students exchange programme .
I stayed with a local family , which happens to be the family of the person that stayed with me when he took part in the same programme .
His name is John , and like me he is getting a degree in Phisics Engeneering in the hope that someday he can work at a research center , such as CERNE , convinientely placed a few miles away from his house .
I strongly recommend that the programme organisers should make interest free loans , available to people wishing to participate in an exchange .
Before addressing the question of what is better for young people , I would like to remind that both activities ( spending time on a computer and watching television ) are harmful for children's / teen 's health .
At the other side it 's impossible to imagine our life without computers and television .
With the help of computers young people can meet new friends , find out a lot of information , take part in forums and discussions .
There are plenty of free sites with content far from morality ; many computer games impose cruelty .
And the idea that , spending time in Internet 's chats young people develop their social skills , is problematic .
I wish it would be so !
But getting used to the Internet 's rules of comunication , they might find it difficult to face up to reality , make friends in the real world .
But when I want to relax I 'd rather watch TV with my friends than loiter away time sitting alone in front of the computer !
This restaurant is recommended to me by my aunt who was working just around the corner of this restaurant a few years ago .
It has a unique modern - rustic interior design suitable for any occasion be it a birthday party , family gathering or even a date with your loved ones .
From my experience , I feel that the food served in this restaurant is of fine quality not to mention how delicious the food is .
Not only that , I was lost for choices as I flipped the menu as there was a huge variety of southeast Asian food that ranges from Thai food , Indonesian food , Chinese food and the list goes on .
The food on the menu was amazingly not for illustration purposes only as the food they served looked exactly like the ones in the menu .
In my opinion , I think this is the most suitable restaurant for this special occasion as everyone would have a wide variety of food to choose from and just let the view of the city enhance the night .
So as the end of term is getting closer and closer , many students are being stressed out and it is certainly not different for me .
But if you know how to deal with your nervousity during exam period , you can take the success of passing exams for granted .
That is one of the most secure ways to make sure , you will manage things on time without getting any redundant stress .
Place it in the most visible and strategical point in your room and stick up to it .
Without a mind and body regeneration , you will not be able to learn as fast and as effectively as you would after a good rest .
To kick off your day , give your body enough energy , in the form of proteins .
Also , to activate your brain quicker , go out for a fresh air .
Mark and leave the most difficult ones in the end .
I remember when I was a kid the only thing I use the phone was to call my friend to play on the street .
The telephone was convenience , something used to help people communicate , to make their lives easier .
Internet changed people 's routine .
Although the large number of advantages that Internet and phones give to us , the use of technology affect people 's ability to communicate face to face .
We just take turns talking ( chatting is maybe more correct to say ) and most of the times without any aim .
Using messages people forget to use grammar or even make full sentances .
The worst thing is that people do n't know how to talk to each other , how to make conversation with new people or even though old friends .
Nowadays communication face to face is something rare and most of the times accident .
People just take turns talking without putting any purpose or feelings .
Thank you for your enquiry and your interest to come here .
There are't many guidebooks about my city so I will recommend you a place worth seeing .
In the centre of the park there is a shaft which is The shaft is beautifully illuminated at night .
There is also a building which can be considered as an interacive museum .
In a very interesting way you can find somehing about the history of Siemianowice and about mines .
There is a lot of old photos compared with new ones .
What impress me the most is a combination of old elements of the building with glass and bricks .
In that building you can find also a small cinema .
During summer park organizes many exhibitions and cultural events .
Silesian culture offers a lot so I think you will have fun visiting The Park of Tradition .
Basketball- the best sport ever !
It 's a team gameplay where you have to start and stop like in aerobics .
It burns lots of calories , build endurance and build up muscles .
80% of the game is mental , you have to think what move you should do next what the rest of the team is up to .
As well as being a great way to stay fit basketball can help you to make new friends and make you a good team player .
Basketball can be played and enjoyed with as a few as two people even if the official games of basketball require 10 people .
The beauty of this sport is that as long as you got a ball you can spend hours dribbling or shooting on your own .
After years of contemplating between staying with Marianne - who was more or less the joy of his parents ' life , not him , Marianne - for life or leaving and start fresh , he has finally chosen the latter , thinking that it was the right decision to make at that moment .
But now , every second that passed after that monumental moment just made him feel worse and worse about himself , making second thoughts about whether he should have stayed with Marianne or not .
He sighed as he sat down on the big empty couch and remembered all the memories he had with Marianne .
He had taken her out to a five - star restaurant , to which she insisted that it was too much , which got Michael to insist that it was okay .
A few weeks later saw the occurrence of their first fight .
Michael had an unexpected late meeting at work that night and forgot to call home , which made Marianne completely furious ; throwing things to the wall , crashing plates from the counter to the ground , the whole nine yards .
Nowadays the healthy habits of young people are very different than in the nineties .
And we need to know the reason for these changes and what we can do to improve it .
Firstly , it is true that the young people used to do sport daily in any where , at the school or in the street and also they did n't use to eat fast food .
Secondly , many people argue that the society has experienced a great changes in the family life .
Although they want the best for their children sometimes is difficult because they are tired and they tend to prepare junk food and allow them to spend their time on the internet or playing with the game machine .
In my opinion , parents should be concerned for their family 's comfort and should motivate their children to do sport , be in contact with a lot of people and avoid eating fast food .
The wind was freezing cold , and now he had to walk to the office , which was a 25-minute walk .
You lost your flight and it was a business trip!You're going to get fired ! "
He said to himself as he whimpered .
I 'm going to talk about doctor who , a British sci - fi TV show about an alien called the Doctor who travels through time and space in a police box called the TARDIS ( Time and Relative Dimension in Space ) .
The first episode aired in 1963 and since then Doctor Who has been one of the most famous sci - fi TV shows on television .
Since the TV show aired the character of the Doctor has been played by 12 actors , the newest one was announced on summer last year , which is when I was visiting London with my family .
It really caught my attention how relevant Doctor Who is in the UK because almost every time I turned on the TV there was someone talking about who could be the new Doctor , it appeared in the news , in newspapers and the day the BBC was going to reveal the name of the actor they even made a special show about it .
Since I was in London , I thought it could visit The Who Shop , it is a shop dedicated to Doctor Who and it has a museum with costumes and other things that have appeared in the TV show .
We did n't have much time to go there because it was far from our hotel so I had to go only with my father while the rest of my family was somewhere else .
If we had stayed more time we would have been able to spend more time at the shop but anyway , I loved going there and meeting other people who also liked Doctor Who and I bought some merchandise from the shop .
When the BBC finally announced who was going to play as the 12th Doctor , many fans got upset about their choice because they thought the new actor was too old and they said they did n't like it .
But hopefully not everyone was like that .
When an important TV show goes through such a big change not everybody likes it , that is why the same thing happened when the BBC announced who would be playing as the 11th Doctor .
Nobody liked him at first but now that he is leaving everybody loves him and wants him to stay .
Actually , I 'm one of those fans who are sad about the 11th Doctor leaving because he is my favourite one , as he was the one I experienced Doctor Who with because I started watching the TV show when he was playing the main role .
Anyway , before the BBC had announced who was going to play the Doctor 's role , the fans had started making suppositions about who could act as him .
Some said that he would be played by others famous British actors but others thought that an actress should play the new role .
Thanks to it I have met a lot of people who share the same interests as I do and I have discovered some of my favourites TV shows .
I like Doctor Who because time travel has always caught my attention , also I like it because the plot is incredible , something that happened on season one can be connected with some of the last episodes .
As I am studying physical education , I have a lot of experiences of looking after children .
Last year a group of little kids came to university and we had to taught them several games and outdoor activities - thanks to this project , I am able to organise entertaining sports and activities .
I have just completed a 5 years course in English and I got very good marks .
In my view , I am sure I am the right person for the job - because I have patience with children , I know what they enjoy doing , and my cooking skills are very useful too .
I 'm ok .
I 'm ok .
She read it at least twenty times , then threw away and prepared her soul for their father 's arrival .
Most if not all of inhabitants of this planet would answer ' yes ' .
Last century provided us countless opportunities to be more mobile .
We , humans , can say that we live on the planet Earth without being metaphorical first time in all our history .
The world of the first half of the XIX century was quite different from that .
Of course , most of westerners already were able to imagine the Globe with relative accuracy , but the picture in their minds differed from the one in ours .
It rather had the same shades with medieval maps that pictured dragons guarding earthen paradise somewhere near the shore of Indias .
By ' shades ' I mean not real colors , but those undertones that our mind imparts to everything it comes in touch with .
- Nelson Mandela I believe that education is important and it is able to bring about enormous changes to an individual .
Since I was a kid , I have started to think of being a teacher .
That 's why I have always been making an effort to enhance my knowledge and experiences for being a teacher in my future pathway .
Since I was in F.5 , when I became capable to teach somebody , I started to be a Korean teacher and a private English tutor .
Apart from that , it has been a good practice for speaking .
As a teacher , I have to talk in front of many students and that fostered me to become a better speaker .
As to enhance my knowledge , I tried to grab chance to bring up my English level .
In 2014 , I had completed the ' Let 's Debate ' writing program offered by The Standard and written a total of 4 articles for the ' Let 's Debate ' column of The Standard Student and Junior Standard .
It had been a truly valuable program for me and it brushed up on my English .
Moreover , I had also participated in the Standard Chartered Hong Kong English Public Speaking Contest on 2015 .
These experiences were tremendously memorable to me and it was my honor to take part in these events .
Apart from that , as I believe that languages are the basic channel of communications between people , I have studied several foreign languages to equip myself .
Other than Korean , I have also been learning Japanese and Spanish starting from F5 .
Not only can foreign languages become a huge advantage to me , it can also bring me satisfaction and gratification .
I would also like to further my studies of various foreign languages in the university .
Therefore , I have always been willing to be offered the chance to take and English and education related program in my tertiary education so as to fulfill my dream and to accomplish my life goal .
In the first place , it seems to me that it is really important , both for children and parents to communicate in order to organize their lives taking into account the changing schedules .
Using the phone during breaks let the students focus on the lesson and then , have a bit of distraction when they are not there and , what is more , keep parents relaxed because they can communicate with their children and talk about what they need .
That is why I totally agree with Richardson 's modality dealing with this important issue which is present in students , schools and parents lives nowadays .
Secondly , I would like to mention that I agree with the experiment that is taking place in some districts about permitting students use their mobile phones for educational purposes , and what is more , with Richardson 's facing this issue .
Technology is one of the most important parts of our lives , so we should incorporate it to our habits .
However , teachers run the risk of losing their responsibility there , and students can lose their educational way looking at the phones as a way of entertainment instead of as a way to make education enjoyable and effective , as you say in one of your paragraphs : " The Richardson decision is a sound alternative to students secretively using their phones under their desk " .
I consider that something should be done in order to balance pros and cons of having mobile phones present at schools because , firstly , students are the ones who must be present and , what is more , their learning process also must be there .
Apart from that , I strongly believe that technology can be incorporated in the classroom , but teachers and schools are the ones who have to control this activity so that it can be positive both for students and teachers in order to make the learning process more motivating and effective .
Technology and , mostly , mobile phones are part of children and parents lives , so schools do n't have to ban it , but look for alternatives in order that they do n't make a negative effect in education .
Richardson 's methodology is fantastic and I think that there are more , and it is important that we know them in order to be informed about this important issue .
First , to have a successful campaign it is important to know the target market .
After studying our advertising options , it was found that two of them can be suitable for our purpose .
On the other hand , we can set up stands in shopping malls .
In order to obtain maximum benefit from this it will be helpful if we give away product samples .
As I mentioned above , advertising campaign must be appropriate to the target market .
I therefore feel justified in recommending that the campaign in shopping malls will be more effective for us .
This is mainly because besides being cheaper customers will become familiar with the product .
If we choose the appropriate kind of advertising for our product I can assure you that we will succeed .
Twenty years ago the economic situation was better than the current , so people did n't have to work until late and they managed to give a strict education and to care about their children 's health .
Now things have changed : parents work full time and do not take up a lot of their children who are more and more alone and uncontrolled .
When home is empty , teenagers feel free to spend all the time lying on the couch , playing videogames or watching awful programmes on TV .
At the same time they gorge themselves with every kind of food they find in the refrigerator .
A sedentary life style and a poor diet lead of course to overweight .
This is a common issue : in fact juvenile obesity is increasing with bad consequences such as premature diabetes or a permanent disease .
For those people who want to combine fun and health , a good solution could be the running , which is a free , competitive and complete sport .
In Milan the association Runners from Mars welcomes thousands of runners who compete for charity .
It would be a good way to change a lifestyle !
I normally dream but do n't remember when I wake .
One day dreant that I were a millionaire , I bought a huge detached house surrounded by tall trees in a beautiful city , maybe in a city like Seville .
Upstairs , there would be games room where I could play with my nephews , nieces and my daughter , another bathroom , a little office to work and to study English , and finally a huge room called " the cinema - room " , with several comfortable seats and a giant screen where my friends and I could see our favourite films .
First of all , I would like to thank you for offering to look after my house and my bird pet while we go on holidays .
This means a lot to me , you are a wonderful friend .
We are leaving very late at night , but I managed to leave a copy of the key in the reception of the building , you can keep it with you .
I know the only time you have to go there is in the morning , before you go to work , so I would like to ask you to give priority in changing the water for my bird , and seeing if there is still enough seeds in her bowl which , by the way , are in a box next to the cage .
I also left yoghurt and frozen food for you to prepare in the oven or microwave , this way you wo n't have to worry on going back home to have lunch before going to work .
We will be back by the end of the week , so take care and enjoy your mornings with my bright bird , she loves having company so if you could get her to have lunch with you and talk a little with her , she will be happy for the rest of the day .
I ca n't wait to be with her again , I do n't like leaving her for a long time .
Three years ago , I was working as a Spanish teacher in a boarding Australian school .
At the weekends , I carried on a workshop on leisure activities for children in need .
With the rise in time , the entire world has become one concrete jungle .
The human race began from the jungle where he lived amidst the worries and fears of wild beasts and under the illusionary protection of tall trees and now the journey of human race has come to the same scenario where once again , he is living amidst the fears of wild beasts called ' other humans ' and under the ' illusionary protection ' of stalwart buildings that may either collapse due to an earthquake or a terrorist - attack .
This is why , although we have the luxury of extravagant knowledge under our feet because of internet , we encounter complications and complexities in the decoding of our relationships and in deciphering this perennial flow of knowledge .
The religion of Scientology is known as one of the fastest growing religions of the world .
Interestingly , Scientology practitioners use technology to prove their hypothetical statements , for they have constructed machines that exhibit the working of brains through waves and softwares that question a practitioner and provide him with a solution to his worries .
In contrast to this , the religions that have survived since the earlier times had discreet knowledge , however they had a much deeper impact .
Scientology proves how the acquisition of widespread knowledge hasn't stopped the birth of new religions , however , ironically , it has made the philosophies of life more dramatic with the mysterious complexities of technology .
Likewise , there are many conspiracy theorists in the world who time and again circulate rumours regarding the existence of a secret organisation ( illuminati , for instance ) that runs the world secretly and plots for all the pre - timed wars and terrorist - attacks .
The theorists ascertain that the organisation is part religious and part political ; it rules over the international media , thereby being omnipotent .
They present complex informations so smartly that an ignorant fool feels like a sagacious monk , whence he becomes the follower and a voter .
Thus , by all means , today we have an easy accessibility to knowledge and we have a wide range of resources to allocate and obtain endless information .
Nevertheless , there is a stomach - wrenching mystery and indecipherable codes around that sometimes makes a common man wonder about his vulnerable existence and unknowingly being - exploited life .
I choose option A : I think it is a good idea for children to travel on public transit .
First , it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses because by Grade 5 children are able to take care of themselves and each other .
In other words , if parents spoil their offspring then they may become too dependent and incapable of functioning well in society later on .
I think this way can assist them in adapting to society early .
I am forty years old secondary school teacher of Art and I believe I have qualifications that you may be looking for . I have been teaching students for approximately 15 years .
I used to run summer camps and art 's workshops .
Working with groups of people fills me with lots of energy and as they need me I need them too .
I have been studying English for several years and I am preparing for taking FCE exam soon .
I enjoy partcipating in debates .
I would describe myself as a good listener and fluent speaker with strong ability to control the discussion .
Apart from ability to get on well with people I read a lot .
If you would like to take my appliciation further than I would be pleased to hear from you .
The aim of this proposal is to compare the two proposed venues River Boat Disco and Milford Comedy Club and to recommend one based on the survey carried out among the students .
Not only does River Boat Disco has its own experienced DJ , but it also has a buffet which is more then appropriate for this occasion .
However the main disadvantage of the disco is that it ends very early at 10:30 pm , whereas the comedy club is open until 2 am .
The pricing for the disco is very reasonable because it offers the venue , entertainment and food for $ 25 .
Even though the price is $ 5 smaller for comedy club , it is without food and by the end of the night I do not think there would be much difference .
However the comedy club is easy to find and is accessible by metro and taxi .
I would suggest the River Boat Disco because not only does it offer a buffet , but also the people are more likely to converse with each other while listening to music than to a comedian .
There is a great variety of dishes , from starters to main dishes and desserts , my recommendation is garlic bread as a starter .
This restaurant is very affordable , the prices are extremely reasonable , especially if you 're a student , because there 's a special menu called " student 's menu " where you choose two ingredients for you pizza with or without French fries and a drink for about three euros .
Everyone in the staff is extremely nice and very often the owners come to make small talk with the clients .
All in all , I think this woould be the best restaurant for our class to go , since it 's close to the school , it has good prices and a friendly ambience .
Also everyone enjoys Italian food , so everyone would be pleased .
Dreaming about future is like creating an imaginary world , perfect for yourself and the others .
If present does n't satisfy you , let 's take a trip in the future .
Year 2064 .
People are living their lives in a way that we would consider it more than shocking .
Everyone is leaving their perfectly " normal " lives in the sky .
You 've read it well .
Because of the lack of space , people had come with a brilliant idea of creating these floating houses , they are made of a special type of glass and have a spherical shape .
By finding this solution , they have more space to work on earth and they even protect the environment .
When it comes to their jobs , people work on earth , like oldtimes .
They have cars , not like the cars people from 2014 were used to , but they still call them this way .
Once the button is pushed the car finds the driver and literally picks him up .
overall , this is an image of the future .
Now let 's return to the present because we have a lot of work to do if we want to live in that kind of future eventually .
In 2012 I got the Cambridge first certificate in English and I 've been improving my French to pass the exam .
It 's six months since I started teaching gymnastic in a primary school near Milan and I discovered that children are more competitive and honest than adults and I appreciate this .
I always try to motivate them with some educational play and I make them understand how important it is the group .
The school will be close in Summer , so I 'll be available from the 15th of June to the 30th of September .
For references , you can contact the Principal of the School , who will be happy to supply you any information .
Taking a gap - year before starting a university is a lifetime opportunity for lots of people .
It 's a time to develop yourself , to travel , to find friends .
You can also spend that time working and saving money for future years on university camp .
You will definitely part your ways during college and this way you can make memories that will last for a lifetime .
You only live once and wasting such a great possability is unthinkable .
From booking a flight to videocall a distant friend , anything seems very handy nowadays .
However , the main drawback of such advance is that we now rely more on computers than on our capacities .
We are slowly but inesorably loosing readiness to solve problems , unless we can surf the Internet , so that even a single day without technology would turn out to be a nightmare .
How many times in the last ten years have we given up GPS and used a common paper map for a trip ?
Reality is that the fast - paced world we are currently living in is stealing us our own time .
In my view , we should all riconsider the role that computers have gained in our lives .
It was the last year I was attending the high school and final exams were approaching faster than I thought .
Suddenly a plethora of concerns filled my head up : what to do after the school ?
And finally , as for all , the day arrived .
Then when finally it was my turn I seated in front of the teachers and , slowly , I introduced my speech .
Fifteen minutes later it was all over and I felt a brand new person .
After this event I can cope with everything !
As it was said before , the brief time of observation does not allow obtaining that much information about how CLIL is really implemented in a particular educational context , even so the data collected and the following conversation with the teacher , contributed to obtain an interesting picture about how Arts and Crafts is considered and carried out under CLIL umbrella .
CLIL implementation is always a challenge for the teacher , but it seems to be even more difficult when talking about subjects as Arts and Crafts which are more based on the acquisition of skills and the development of another language , the artistic .
How to provide student with more real and relevant input , in the daily routine of an art class , seems to be a dare for Arts and Crafts teachers , who need to bring together the development of the artistic language and the learning of a foreign language .
It is interesting to see how the students resort each other looking for help in a natural way , without the intervention of the teacher .
Peer support is something that teachers expect and promote in all subjects , but it seems to emerge more genuinely when talking about CLIL atmosphere .
I am writing to express my interest to the bar staff opening you have posted on our school 's noticeboard .
First of all , I strongly believe that I would be the most suitable applicant because of my long experience in bar servicing .
For last six years , I have worked in a number of different bars within the busy city district region .
I know what involves in a late night customer service and how to deal with a loud environment .
All of the bars I worked hosted a night club after 10 PM therefore you do not need to worry about extra tiredness caused by late hour work .
In addition , my knowledge acquired by managing a bar and a certification in hygeinic food handling will guerantee the clean environment of your bar .
At last , I would like to emphasise my professionalism towards alcohol service .
I am a bartender who has awarded three times in international bar - show contests .
The time allocations you have suggested on the job advertisement also suit my schedule perfectly .
Furthermore , some learners respond better to an explicit focus on rules , which make them aware of the mistakes they are making .
I fully believe that this combination method is the most effective way for students to learn English .
Now we are going to evaluate the main charactheristics and differences between a pellet stove and a pellet boiler .
Let 's start to focus our attention at the pellet stove .
The diagram shows a compact structure and the simplicity of the machine ; it has three main sections : the feed section , the combustion chamber and the blower(i.e .
In the first conic part it is possible to feed with the fuel ( i.e. the pellet ) that leads to the combustion chamber where the pellet will burn to generate the heat necessary to warm up the air .
As mantion above the heat is necessary to warm up the air that , thanks to the fan , will be blown out to the room in order to warm up the external ambient ( e.g. room , bathroom , kitchen ... ) .
This is a pretty compact machine but it 's not very efficient and very clean .
Actually , it produces a high amount of pollution such as ash and exhausted gas that contains micro- and nano - particle .
The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove , the difference is that instead of a fan here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house , so it 's nedded a pump to do that instead of just a fan ( the pourpose of a fan and a pump it 's the same : move fluid from a point A to a pont B , but in one case you have to move air and in the second case water ( they have a different density : water has 1000 times the density of air ) .
Like in the stove there is a feed section where you can feed the pellet that will go directly to the combustion chamber ( according to the control system ) in order to burn it and generate the heat to warm up the water .
Now , thanks to the pump the hot water is able to reach the upstairs rooms .
Basically the two rely on the same methods : burning pellets to warm up a fluid ( air for the stove and water for the boiler ) .
Knowing a clean and tidy city is no less appealing to the tourists than beautiful scenery and bargain shopping , both the authority and the citizens understand the need to keep our city clean in order to keep the tourists coming , therefore they are serious in protecting the environment .
To keep the city clean and tidy , people adopt an environmentally friendly attitude in daily life : they refuse littering , if they can not find a rubbish bin around , they keep rubbish in small plastic bag ; at home , they separate the recyclable items from the rubbish before they get rid of the rubbish .
They follow the government 's advice to set the air conditioner temperature at 25 degrees of Celsius .
It build sewage sites for the disposal of the city 's waste .
We are lucky to live in a city where both the authority and the people have a strong sense of environmental protection .
Among a variety of sports , there is the football also known as soccer .
Since I was very young , roughly at the age of thirteen , football became my favorite sport and it was an activity that I could never stop doing .
As the time passed , I became more skilled at football .
I signed up for a feminine football team in my city .
We had our own trainer , which was a man who played football before .
Secondly , it has helped me to improve my health condition in several ways .
For example , it contributes to my cardiovascular system .
And thirdly , it is an activity where I have been able to make new friends who , besides playing football as me , are very similar to me in other features .
As you get involved with football and you enroll with this sport , you will clearly notice the benefits it brings to your daily life .
' I think we 're being followed ' said Sara to me , as we pulled over the street .
Despite the fact that We 'd had to share a table with others tourists , we 'd had a great time .
Sara had left our hire - car keys on top of the table and had paid no attention to them for a while .
When we were about to leave we realized that there were a short letter on the table . ' I have your car keys .
Wait for me , please ' it said .
We 'd been driving for half an hour when I noticed that there were a white car behind us .
We pulled over the main road .
You 've had the wrong keys and the wrong car ' said the man .
As soon as the man explained everything to us we realised that we had mistaken car keys in the restaurant because both of them were exactly alike .
We exchange addresses and as time went on we became good friends .
I ended up working to Mr Smith ' company in Madrid where I 've been working there for 20 years .
People seem to be living quiet comfortable lives nowadays .
When thinking about how the lives of people will be like in the next 50 years , the first thought that comes to my mind is a person sitting lazily on a sofa that can adjust itself to his / her will .
The reason for the laziness is that the work of the house will be done by robots .
This is how I think life would be in the next 50 years .
Robots will continue to be improved , till they will be able to do all work at home , so no one rich enough to afford a robot would bother to do the work himself / herself .
However , not everything about the life in the next 50 years will be positive .
Shopping is my favourite pastime , and I simply can not imagine anything more relaxing and joyful than spending my hard - earned money .
But with a heavy heart I have to agree with this statement .
There might appear a few situations , when shopping instead of joy can bring a headache .
The best example here could be the regular , every - week filling - the - fridge shopping , which in principle can not be pleasant .
Personally I am not able to find anything exciting in hanging around extremely high supermarket shelves and pushing heavy trolley . Crowd in every corner , awful and unpleasant lights and the necessity to run from one end of the market to another , because these shops are organised in the way , which forces you to see everything , in order to find what you really need .
What is more I hate do shopping when I really need to buy something .
Because there is this wicked , unwritten rule , according to which if you are looking for something , there is not the slightest chance you will get it .
Shopping with your husband , boyfriend , father or any representative of the male kind , also can totally ruin the most fruitful shopping ever .
The constant grumbling , regular checking the time , this anxious and adrift facial expression - how on earth it could create a favourable conditions for shopping ? !
And believe me there is no difference if you are shopping for yourself or for them , it always looks this way .
In conclusion , shopping can be and usually is a great opportunity , not only to expand contents of your wardrobe , but also , to relax and spend a great time .
You just have to avoid supermarkets , buy clothes in advance - so there will not appear the situation , when you need something really badly and it is not in your closet , and of course of the male company , better choose the female companion .
I saw your advertisement and would like to apply to work in the USA in one of your Summer camps .
Since then I have attended a course for the preparation of the CAE exam , and spent two weeks in Ireland during the Summer working as a babysitter , so I have had experience working with children .
This can be noted in the fact that I was head of entertainment in my High School for two years .
During these two years I was responsible for the organisation and booking of bands .
I love learning new skills and although I 've never worked in a kitchen before but I 'd love to try my hand at cooking .
I quickly took my things and went out of the classroom hoping to arrive as soon as possible home .
Ten minutes after I had already taken my trainers and closed the gym door when I saw her walking towards me .
-"Michie!Wait for me ! "
I only wanted to tell you that Joe is going to make a party in his house tomorrow at 8 p.m. and I 'll be there "- she said
-"Thank you for the information . Bye "- I said , knowing what I was n't going to do tomorrow .
Half an hour after I arrived home .
And Cass , the girl I 'm in love with slammed the door .
My name is Richard Raya , I am 35 years old and live in the Basque Country in northern Spain .
in a one on one role .
Without knowing it , I was preparing myself for a position like this one , such as working
skills in sports and also a fun loving attitude towards organising activities .
pastimes , when I cook it 's usually for a big group of friends , so preparing meals is actually something I
I am available at anytime as the summer holidays are upon us .
Do you practise any sport ?
If so , you will know all the benefits but also effort that it takes .
For me it was n't funny at all so I always tried to skip my classes , and I finally did n't go back the following year .
I think that this is not a usual sport , but it has the same advantages : it burn calories , improve circulation , is good for the bones and muscles ... Therefore is a really beautiful way to exercise and help you to improve flexibility .
My advice for people who would like to start dancing ballet is : do n't be afraid , it does n't matter if you are seven or seventy , if you want to do it you can .
Dear director ,
I would really like to participate as a co worker in this summer camp .
Whereas in my opinion , it is way more than that .
By looking after children between the ages of 8 and 12 , I can experience new skills that will be useful in my future with my future kids .
On the one hand , I have never worked in the kitchens before .
First , the fire , then agriculture , irrigation , and nowadays with technology .
The discovery of electricity has increased our productivity greatly .
Instead of just working during the day , man now could continue working during the night .
Then with TVs , information started to spread faster and faster until our contenporary instantaneous reports from across the world in the palm of our hands .
Sometimes it seems we have reached the pinacle of existence .
I 'm sure the pharaos of Egypt felt that way when they gazed at the Pyramids .
Now , we can look at those Pyramids from the other side of the world , receiving a live video feed in a device we hold in our hands .
In the next 50 years , who know what we will be able to accomplish .
Education and technology are deeply related , to a certain extent in that education has suffered a series of changes throughout the past 20 years .
In present times it is very common to see people learning courses through a computer .
Online learning has become a modern phenomena in order to gain knowledge ; however , face - to - face learning is still the better learning option chosen by students .
Although there are many differences among these two , similarities can be found as well .
Currently , exist all types of courses via the Internet , at any academic or vocational level .
For instance , degree courses , master courses or just an updating course can be found .
Adding to this , both learning options require time and dedication from students ; otherwise , knowledge will not be properly delivered .
On the other hand , differences between face - to - face learning and virtual learning are numerous .
Firstly , online learning conveys flexibility in its shedule .
Studentd can attend courses when they decide , but always respecting due dates .
Another difference between face - to - face learning and online learning may be that face - to - face learning allows students to develop human - relationships , whereas online learning is quite impossible on this to happen .
During face - to - face learning students have a teacher - student relationship , as well as a peer - to - peer relationship , allowing them to develop inter - personaal skills and coexistence .
Last but not least , time spent on these courses are different too .
When doing a fece - to - face course besides having an attendance schedule , people spend more time commuting to the place where the course is given .
In current days , traffic jams are a fact in big cities ; therefore a lot of time is lost commuting .
Consequentlu , both learning options have their positive and negative aspects .
Assessing these similarities and differences each student has the option to choose the option which better suits in his lifestyle .
Peschiera Borromeo , a little town near Milan , has an agricultural reality and there are many possibilities to walk around and to train yourself in a running parcour .
Unfortunately there is a lot of traffic , so the best place to avoid it is a little artificial lake called Idroscalo where people can run along the 7 kilometres perimeter or cycling open air while looking at the swans .
In this area you can find many facilities such as two swimming pools , a tennis and a volleyball court .
People can also try canoeing at the local school or the water skiing with a mechanical device that drags you on the water .
For those who feel brave , there is also a wall where you can climb with all equipment .
If you too have got a dog and want to teach him something useful , take him here every Sunday morning and a trainer will teach him how to save people from drowning and your friend will become a lifeguard !
In his opinion the concept of protectionism in the world of global economy is not effective .
There is a good example involving developing countries , which economies have been successful due to being the most opened to free trade , and countries with a low economic growth , that closed themselves off to international trade .
Although in the lecture it is admitted that international competition can cause problems to local businesses , mentioned in the article , he claims that it is worth competing with global corporations , because this way survived local companies may get stronger than ever .
And finally , the article states that free trade does not always lead to peaceful relationship between nations , but the lecturer draws attention to European common market set up after World War II .
To test the research 's hypothesis , self - administrated questionnaires were used on a total of 400 customers .
The target population included telecommunication service users who subscribed a loyalty program .
The choice of telecommunication industry in this framework is related to the vital role of loyalty and retention in this service setting .
This sample size allows us to perform multiple data analysis ( multivariate and SEM ) .
Everyone in this world has their own favorite sports , so do I. My favorite sport is football .
I often play this with my friend in the evening .
Football is played at a professional level all over the world , and millions of people regularly go to football stadium to follow their favorite team , whilst millions more avidly watch the game on television .
In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans , local communities , and even nations ; it is therefore often claimed to be the most popular sport in the world .
I learnt teambuilding , discipline as well as teamwork through playing football .
There are many worldwide international competition of football .
One of the major international competitions in football is the World Cup organized by Fédération Internationale de Football Association .
The next World Cup takes place in Russia 2018
The star I admired most in football is Edson Arantes do Nascimento , nicknamed Pelé , is a former Brazilian football player and thought by many to be the finest player of all time .
Since his full retirement he has served as an ambassador for the sport .
There are many reasons as football is my favorite game .
Holidays are mostly about relaxing therefore I disagree with always trying new things .
In my mind , holidays are essentially about being comfortable , staying in your element and simply enjoying your time off and not about creating uncomfortable situations if that might be the outcome of trying new things .
Change is never easy and being able to try new things is indeed a valuable trait for one to have , however I do not have such traits .
On the contrary to the subject I disagree having to try new and challenging things on holidays due to the fact that I take much more pleasure reading novels which make me feel all the rush of an outside activity all the while keeping me safe and comfortable .
The actors and literally amazing .
Their acting is on spot and the costumes and magnificent .
The role of Suleyman is played by Turkey 's most famous actor Halit Ergenc and he 's amazing at it .
The actress who plays Suleyman 's wife , Hurrem is none other than Meryem Uzerli .
There are many languages people in my country learn , but English would be the most popular as it is a world wide language .
Who learns languages in my country
Other language of their choice follows at secondary school .
Students at some schools also have a possibility of exchange programmes but these can be quite expensive and not every family can afford such an event .
Adults usually attend language courses , or use a variety of on - line courses .
I would recommend the government to increase salaries for Spanish , Italian or French teachers to persuade them to teach at schools instead of giving private lessons .
It would also be wise to donate schools that prepare exchange programs for their students , so that more of them could afford that .
example , is there _ park or cinema nearby ?
It would be great if all of us have a healthy life .
As a consequence , they become slim and they do n't ingest enough proteins and vitamins to have a healthy life
On the other hand , teenagers are becoming more dependent on cellphones , video games and television which make them being more sedentary .
Being always on the bed or on the sofa is not recommended , whereas going outside and run or ride a bicycle would be a better option .
This way they would be doing physical exercise .
Finally , to be healthy it is also important to eat balanced food .
Snacks , fast food , fried food and sweets are part of young people 's life as they can find them everywhere : in the shops on the street , at parties and in shopping malls .
Being sedentary and eating fast food will not bring them anywhere .
It is easy , fast and , we can almost park it right outside our destination or at walking distance -shorter rather than longer .
It is initially expensive but it is so handy that we end up thinking it is part of us and even think we can not live without it .
Publis transport is always going to be slower , less flexible and much less convenient but we have the reassurance that we are doing what is best for our planet .
We are complying to the norm .
Thus , is it understandable why many feel younger government workers should be incubated before given promotion to important positions .
In addition to fresh ideas , it should be remembered that to get a government job , one has to successfully engage a rigorous screening process .
Although the above look reveals solid evidence for both sides of the argument , it is felt that the healthiest approach to designating government positions is to ensure candidates fulfil rigorous training programs .
In order to achieve its objectives , Trivago invested more money in the promotion in 2014 .
For example , it promoted their search engine by the television commercial and Youtube advertisement .
The Youtube advertisement means the viewers have to be enforced to watch the advertisement before they watch some video in Youtube .
Since most of the people watch the television not just a few minutes or do not just watch one or two video(s ) in Youtube , they will be enforced to watch its advertisement more than one times .
Trivago has a very simple and rememberable tagline which is ' Hotels ?
The audiences are easy to think of Trivago when they are thinking about hotels .
Also , Trivago wants to increase its market share by entering Hong Kong Market .
Many Hong Kongers love to travel and go to different country to feel the culture and enjoy the different lifestyle .
Many of them try to plan the cheapest way for their trip include booking the worthiest hotel .
If they aware the benefits of using Trivago , they will love to use this as they could spend less time to compare all the hotels .
Therefore , Trivago use the advisement to increase its market share in Hong Kong .
Moreover , Trivago is trying to enhance the company image in Hong Kong .
Trivago is not much common in Hong Kong .
Some people even probably do not know what it is .
If Trivago want to gain benefits from the Hong Kong market , it has to develop and enhance their brand image .
Trivago is trying to represent that it is the most convenient hotel search engine in the market .
The last but not the least , Trivago wants to boost its download rate in the mobile application platforms .
Almost all the advertisements are encouraging audience to download its mobile application .
If there are more people download its mobile application , it means more people to know its brand and use its service .
We found one of the Television advertisements which is currently undertaking in Hong Kong .
The advertisement is about 16 seconds .
There is a narrator introduces the function of Trivago and demonstrates " how to use its mobile application to search for a worthiest hotel . "
At the last of the video , the screen shows a tagline and the website of Trivago .
Television Commercial
In general , television is the most popular media in Hong Kong .
Advertising by television is an effective way to communicate the service to the general public .
Since that television is able to reach a large number of people during a short period of time , more potential customers will be exposed to its service .
Music helps stimulates sense and focus attention toward the advertisement .
The background music in the advertising is relaxed and excite .
It can make people feel youthful and it matches to the taste of young adults which are Trivago 's target customers .
It helps audience to better recall the advertisement and stored it in long - term memory .
The television advertisement shows the service being using .
It demonstrates all the steps from searching the hotel , choosing selection criteria and comparing the price to different hotels .
Through the demonstration , Trivago can show to the audience how easy to use its mobile application to find a worthiest hotel .
It can enhance its creditability as the audience can clearly to know what its service is .
On the other hand , as a mobile application , some people probably feel confused about how it operates .
Therefore , with the visual effect , demonstration is the most effective way to teach the audience to use the mobile application .
The television commercial presents information to the audience in a straight - forward manner .
For example , he says the application can instantly compare the rates to over 150 websites .
For those who are high interested in hotel searching service , they may notice to such informative advertisement .
It clearly presented that its searching engine can help the customers to compare the price of over 150 websites of hotels in the world and find the most worthy hotel .
This is a testable claim and Trivago can use it to be its unique selling proposition .
At the same time , it increases the confidence of the customers for choosing its services .
As Hong Kong is a new market for Trivago , it needs to enhance its popularity in there .
Before 2014 , Trivago is not famous in Asia .
It needs to utilities some strategies to increase its brand awareness and the information about its services toward its customers in order to achieve the promotional objectives .
In the television commercial , the narrator tells the audiences to download the Trivago mobile application in their mobile phone .
It encourages customer to purchase its services and truly make use of it .
The purpose is to increase the sale and enlarge its market share in Hong Kong .
Moreover , " Means - End Chain " is adapted in the television advertisement .
By using the Trivago 's services , customers can search the worthiest price of the hotel room to gain benefit .
Trivago can achieve the personal value for customers through the advertisement .
Some people desire to have a comfortable and pleasure journey with lower prices and the freedom of choosing their favorite accommodation .
The advertisement can show that they are wisdom by using Trivogo service to plan an economically trip .
Mean - End Chain is being used as Trivago is not only to help customer search for a hotel room , but also to achieve the personal value for customer which is worthier than money the customer saved in booking a hotel room .
Trivago use this way to enhance its brand image and competitive advantage since the value of its services is increased .
Audience can easily remember the brand name and get a plain awareness and knowledge of Trivago services .
Trivago does not choose radio to be their media as it is antiquated .
Attention of the radio commercial is low .
Also , radio advertisements only contain verbal effect .
Even through people listen to the radio advertisement of Trivago , they probably do not know how to spell the word ' Trivago ' as it is not a normal vocabulary .
It makes people hard to search Trivago on the Internet .
Therefore , the product awareness driven by radio advertisement is not enough .
Newspaper is also not a good media since newspaper has been recently replaced by online newspaper .
Likewise , Trivago is an online service so Newspaper advertisement may not appropriate for it .
Lastly , hire spokesperson consequent high cost in promotion .
And there is a risk of hiring a spokesperson as he may not bring an expected return for the company .
Sometimes , if there is a spokesperson in an advertisement , the focus of audience maybe shifts from the product to the spokesperson .
The promoting objective is difficult to be achieved .
Therefore , television commercial is likely the most suitable method to promote its brand in Hong Kong .
Not even a month before he had paid a fortune to get his place refurbished and painted .
He headed the front door in rage .
Jacob remained there bursting in rage .
While he was standing on the pavement tears of resentment covered his face .
Have you ever watch a game that involves people running around a field and scoring goals by kicking a ball ?
I know that for some , playing football is boring but for me , it 's the most awesome thing ever .
I think I had watched almost all the football matches in history especially when it was the FIFA World Cup season .
Although , I do n't play really well , but I would choose it over any other sports any day .
I would feel free when I 'm in the field .
90% of our conversation includes football and we can talk all day about it for sure .
Here is some advice to someone who is starting to this sport .
Make sure to play smoothly for the first time and make sure to use a football shoe when you 're playing in the field .
This advice is to avoid you from injuring yourself as a beginner in football .
I 've played tennis for 5 years now and I can assure you it 's one of the best sports any person can do !
Also , I love it because it takes my mind off worries .
As well as that , tennis gives me the opportunity to stay fit and meet new people .
Since it 's not very easy at the beginning , if you are interested in taking up tennis you should persevere and train at least twice a week .
All in all , I 've practised many sports in my life but tennis 's been far the best exercise for both , my mind and body .
I really get a lot of pleasure in doing it .
My hero and my foe
Clown Bassie , on the other hand , is an actor of a TV - programme for children .
After a live show , he made a little girl crying by shouting at her and then kicked her in the back .
Clearly , travel in your own car is much more comfortable than on public transport .
These people believe that ver the next few years we will see a severe decline in the amount of people using bus , trains , trams , etc . to get places .
In my opinion , this is dissapointing for a number of reasons .
First of all , public transport bring us closer to other people .
By using public transport we reduce our carbon footprint and help to save the Earth .
Furthermore , we also save time : as cities become bigger it becomes more and more difficult to park , which in turn leads to us wasting time looking for somewhere to park , or wasting money in expensive carparks .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport should be a necessary part of everybody 's life , we should use it every day to save the Earth , money , and time .
Directed by Tim Burton , the story is a retelling of fantasy novel Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland .The film shows a young Alice Troubled by a strange recurring dream , the loss of her beloved father , an unwanted marriage proposal , and the oppressive expectations of the society in which she lives .
Unsure of what to does , she chase a rabbit in a blue waistcoat , and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole From which she emerges in a forest , where she is greeted by many strange creatures .
There Alice will star an adventure where she must slay the Red evil Queen and restore the White Queen to power .
But we must not forget about the marvelous acting of Johnny Deep ( as the mad hatter ) and Helena Bonham Carter ( as the red queen ) , with them the film would n't be the same .
But what really makes it magical is the makeup and the costume design , they really managed to create something amazing with the appearance of characters .
Firstly , I should say that life nowadays is unthinkable without science .
In the century of advancing communications and technology it is hard to imagine the world without medicine , astronomy , computers , and history .
Without its help , for example , we would have never realized were we have come from .
By using computers nowadays it is very convenient to find the information you are looking for .
There is no secret for the human beings today because they have explored every place on the Earth .
They climb the highest mountains , dive in the depths of oceans , and conduct dangerous experiments and all for the sake of science .
The present belief is that scientific approach will solve all the problems and do away with all difficulties .
That is why science is so significant nowadays .
The obsession to know everything has led some of us to make dangerous experiments for which we pay with our lives .
With its help we cope with different situations and that is why it is so fundamental to human existence and I think is not evil .
At some time or another , each and every young person must provide themselves with the necessary skills . « What can I do for my life ? » .
After all a successful career is best measured in how satisfying you find it , and it 's easier to develop strengths and skills than to actually have to learn to find something interesting .
While we are studying we may not think seriously about job .
But in a few years time our job will be one of the most important things in our everyday life .
When someone asks an adult " what do you do ? "
Work , for most of us , will be the defining aspect of life and thus of our identity .
Through our work we find an identity , we can find status , intellectual stimulation as well as wealth which enables us to buy comfort .
Our working identities can change over time , our identity and behaviours as a young graduate are different from those of the professional expert and from those of the senior leader .
Our ability to develop our identity is critical to our ability to be successful in a range of career roles , we need to shed our old identity and add new elements .
We each have a picture of who we are and what we will / won't do in our heads , once formed our brains garner the evidence that it is a true picture and ignore evidence that suggests that it is not true .
So people say ' I do n't do numbers ' , ' I do n't do detail ' ' I do n't do preparation ' , they believe it and make it true . '
I ca n't do sales ' becomes a self fulfilling prophecy .
We can change our beliefs , actions and thus our identity through experimentation , practice and conscious self discipline .
In an age where career progression may lead us into new environments and sectors it is ever more important to challenge our sense of self and explore whether you can create ' a new you ' by changing the beliefs you hold about yourself and the world in order to develop and expand your career options .
There are more than 200 old , abandoned , local buildings in our capital city .
But most of them are about to be declined by town planners .
Firstly , demolition is partly caused by how valuable the old buildings are estimated .
Old local buildings often do not provide opportunities to make any money , they only cost town planners a lot of money because they probably need to be renovated .
And above that , without public funds there are too few people who show they care about the fate of historical buildings .
This might cause that town planners will think there are not enough reasons to keep them .
After all , the factor with the most influence on decline of local buildings is the lack of public funds which make it possible to keep our old buildings , or at least a few of them , because these funds frequently accumulate money for projects like renovations .
Any form of public transport like a bus or a train is too much of an inconvenience especially in a large city such as London .
Imagine going to work on a rainy day : you have one hand on your umbrella and the other clutching your bag , the wind is blowing mist on your face and a puddle of water is sprinkling tiny dots of wet dirt in your stilleto while you are making your way to a bus station .
Indeed , the method by which a person go from point A to point B can spell the difference between a good and a bad day .
Transportation is very important in our daily life and in this modern world we live in , the very least that we expect from almost anything is inconvenience .
This is why , most of us , prefer to travel with our own car rather than by a public transport ; not only that it keeps us within our private sphere , it also keeps us dry travelling on a rainy day .
Yes , we are willing to spend more in the name of convenience . We 'd rather pay a hefty price for gas than be inconvenienced in a public transport .
So when I came across this advertisement yesterday , I found myself thinking how wonderful it would be to apply for this job .
I believe myself to be a suitable person for this job , as I am a hard working , reliable , cheerful , fun - loving person .
Those children are too old for babysitters now , but I love children and would really like working with them again .
I believe myself to be a proficient cook , as I 've always cooked for my family in the weekends .
Two years later we moved back , but I continued speaking in both Dutch and English to my parents .
Thank you so much for your time , I hope you 'll consider me for this position .
Yours sincerely ,
It means that other people feel challenged and do n't want to fall behind and look underdogs .
Without this stimulus they may have been inactive .
On the other hand almost equal number of people may maintain a contrasting point of view .
They give examples when the desire to become famous made people aggressive and ruthless .
I can illustrate my words by the example of military campaigns .
The desire of some country 's leaders to become famous and to glorify their names as great commanders brought about wars and conflicts between countries .
Hundreds and thousands of innocent people may fall victim to the insatiable desire of such fame -seeking personalities .
So , all in all , we can not answer this question as " yes " or " no " because there is almost equal number of examples that help to support the contracting points of view .
She checked the hour , then decided to call Michael .
He 'll call later'she thought .
She wanted to surprise Michael with delicious pasta and some rose wine .
The ride felt like and eternity .
She parked her car a few meters away for Michael 's office and walked up to it .
I 'm pregnant and we need to solve this out .
" I do n't know."said the familiar male voice . "
You need to understand this . I 'll pay alimony and help you with the kid , but I can not lose Susan " .
she could n't believe her ears .
Michael has been cheating on her .
Full of rage and disappointment she opened the door and saw the woman sitting in Michael 's lap .
When she got home she packed some of her belongings and drove to her best friend 's house .
She heard heavy footprints on the stairs and buried her head deeper in the pillow .
I am very happy to see you all ones again .
I am here today to deliver a speech to you about boycott bullying .
These days we see in the walls written boycott of stop bullying .
Do we know the real meaning of the word bullying .
Those who have been the targets of bullying can suffer from long term emotional and behavioral problems .
Bullying can cause loneliness , depression , anxiety , lead to low self - esteem and illnesses .
In conclusion , I would like to say that self harm , low self esteem and bullying are all causes of destruction in our schools . We need to stop this .
Now to boycott bullying form our school i request all of you to take an oath that , I make a commitment to take a stand against bullying . I will treat others with respect and kindness .
I will have to compassion to not be a bully and the courage to not to be a bystander .
Michael was sitting on the bench of the garden , waiting for his mother to finish her work .
She was on the cold ground , laying like a dead body , her son sat by her side , trying to wake her up .
He stopped when he saw the dark shadow walking to him .
It was a man in his late thirties , very thin and light grey eyes .
He raised his hand , whom was holding a metal bar , full of blood .
Michael had no time to scream , he was already laying on the floor , by his mother 's side .
She was not dead , but in coma , in a hospital .
He was in the same state as her for about a week after the drama , and had to live on his own for the years who came .
He walked up to her room , where she was comfortly sleeping in her bed .
Tonight , she would be gone , he already signed the papers , his choice was made .
He took a deep breath before leaning over her and kissed soflty her forehead .
I am twenty - year - old student in my second year at National University of Culture of Ukraine .
Also , I can play several music instruments , such as : violin , guitar , drums and tambourine .
Furthermore , I love children very much , the reason can be such fact that I have three younger brothers and one younger sister , so I am the older one .
However , I have no experience working with children , apart from helping my parents with brothers and sister .
But in dance area I have a lot of achievements , such as victories in different competitions and festivals .
I am very active and creative person with desire to work .
And of course , as required , I can speak English quite well and have a certificate that shows it .
In my point of view , my candidacy is enough suitable for this job , because I am young person , that has all required skills and a lot of energy to work .
When I was in school I used to go to my granparents ' home to have lunch because my parents were at work , I fondly remember my gandma 's great cooking skills that she still owns to this day .
Those years I was very familiar with the smell of cheese burguers , BBQ pizzas and also kebabs .
By the time my high school years were done , and right when I attended university , I developed certain predilection for typical healthy Spanish , unavoidibly combined with less fast food due to the usual diners with friends .
The main cause of that change was that I had to have breakfast , lunch and dinner at my college dorm 's dining room that had amazingly good cooks , They 'd cook really good dishes such as cocido , garbanzos and paella .
If all of used cars , the levels of pollution would be incredibly high .
Public institutions should encourage the use of public transport , especially trains as they use electricity and are less pollutant than other means of transport .
Traffic is a really big problem in cities nowadays and only the use of public transport can make a significant difference in the quality of life in our cities .
If those who run public transportation systems hope to make them greener in the future , they 'll have to come with solutions that are both energy efficient and effective .
My first degree gave me a good track record in physiology and anatomy , and the experience , as a biological sciences ' student and as a research fellow , allowed me to build a scientific thinking .
Furthermore , I have improved my skills in molecular , biochemical , bioinformatics and microscopic techniques , and I also would like to point up my high motivation to develop expertise in stem cells and pharmaceutical research .
I am interested in the English Course in which I can learn at my own pace .
First of all , I consider very important to learn a second language and English is a very used one around the world .
In addition to that , I am graduated in Computer Science and there is a lot of information available in this language .
Finally , I have interest in technology , environment and science .
I live in a small village , in the German region of Hesse , called Griesheim .
- One for the paper ;
- One for the bio waste ; and ,
- One for the waste that can not be recycled .
The cost of the waste disposal service depends only on the volume of non - reciclable waste produced .
There are also public conainers for glass and clothes all around the village .
Eventually , the citizen becomes part of a very meticulous recycling process by looking up to the cost .
On the other hand , the city provides a punctual public transport system , very convenient .
Trams are available 24 hours and tram stops are evenly distributed ; it takes no more than 8 minutes walking from one stop to the next one .
To ride is another suitable option , if the weather allows .
He would only drag himself out of his house when he heard a new type of food was created .
Jack lived with his mommy , he had no job , and when she had told him to be independent , he only lasted one month before going on poverty .
He was really sad because the government was enforcing a law on banning new types of food , this had become a huge problem because more Americans were getting diabetes .
One day before this new law was established , a crazy scientist created a new waffle , " the great , furry waffle .
" This was an incentive for Jack to go out , he was sure that destiny had rewarded him with this blessing because he had eaten ten hot dogs in a row , although he felt a bit sick after , he knew it was worth the try .
There was a bit of conflict in his plan , the new waffle was in Texas , and he lived in Washington .
He saw on his mommy 's television that if he was the first person to try the waffle , he would get a bonus of a hundred bacon strips .
Jack bought a ticket to the earliest flight to Texas , once he got off the plane he ran through the landscape .
He liked the trend of everyone being fat in America , that way he could fit in .
The scientist gave him " the great , furry waffle " and a bunch of syrup .
Jack grabbed it and put it in his mouth , he could taste heaven in his mouth .
In a matter of seconds nothing he fell to the ground , choking .
Suddenly , a giant fish fell from the sky , causing him spit out the hairball , Jack could not believe what he saw , the man riding the fish was Bugs Bunny !
Jack finally lost weight and lived happily ever after , the end .
Have you ever stopped to think that exist some standards in the society that everyone knows and follows although some people do it unconsciously ?
These standards are called unwritten rules which can be defined as unspoken rules imposed in each culture to make the population to live more civilly ( Bob Greene , How Unwritten Rules Circumscribe Our Lives - Paragraph 6 ) .
In fact , since the beginning , the written rules have helped to create the civilizations while the unwritten rules have helped to maintain them , allowing life to be more harmonious .
For example I can cite the importance of the unwritten rules in my own culture , the Brazilian culture .
There are some aspects and actions that everyone who lives in Brazil needs to follow , and those directly reflect the values of the Brazilian culture .
One of the most important unwritten rules that you should follow in Brazil is related to the vocal patterns .
When Olquin said that the situation and the environment define the correct tone of speech ( 1995 ) , he was talking about the African American Communication , but he is also describing the Brazilian communication at the same time .
Even though there is no definite consensus about the exact vocal patterns in Brazil , there are some facts about the extremes of it .
First , Brazilians feel uncomfortable when people close to them raise their tone of voice and continue speaking loudly during a long time , without they have clear reasons .
It means that you pretend to transform the dialog in a monolog ; moreover , unknown people in the same environment of you frequently do not want to know about your thinking .
In Brazilian culture , if during a conversation a person speaks too low , the listener will assume that the speaker does not want to continue with the dialog or does not care about what you are talking .
In both the extremes of a speech , loud and low , there is a violation of the values of a good communication .
Therefore , when you are in a conversation , it is important to pay attention to execute with successful the unwritten rules of vocal patterns .
As vocal patterns are considered so important for Brazilians , personal territory is another unwritten rule that is easy to see people using on the streets daily .
When you are in a space that you feel comfortable being around other people that you do not know , this space is your personal territory .
And , it can change according to your degree of familiarity or intimate with the other person .
In some countries like the United States , whose respect of personal territory is extremely important , the public and the intimate space can vary between 25 feet and the touching ( Edward T. Hall ) .
In Brazil also there is this difference between the public and the intimate space , yet the magnitude of this is not the same of the U.S.
Although the Brazilians have a shorter personal space in comparison with the United States , they are no tolerant with strangers invading it .
Soon , even though the distance between people are shorter in Brazil , both countries value the idea of maintaining a space that both people feel comfortable , called personal space .
Although Brazilians usually do not worry about distance made by others , people from different cultures believe that Brazilians spend much time looking at others .
For example , in some cultures , Brazilians can be considered rude by women because they like to keep a constant eye contact , and for these women this means a lack of respect or invasion of privacy .
In general , this supposition is not regarded as true for many people in our culture since Brazilians believe that constant eye contact is one of the most important points to maintain a good dialog .
According to article " Nonverbal Communication : Speaking without Words " , eye contact is important because " insufficient eye contact can create communication barriers " .
In fact , in Brazil , the eye contact is primordial , being considered without interest to speaker or that the speaker is bothering you if you do not give enough attention when you are talking to .
The source of this rule is easy to be identified especially when the parents are talking to their kids ; it is hard to get exclusively the kid 's attention , but the parents insistently repeat , " look at me when I am talking to you " .
Therefore , this interaction demonstrates that the eye contact can have a strong influence in the cultural values of attentiveness and respect with the others ' opinion .
After being socially judged by the society , we can perceive the direct influence of unwritten rules in our cultural values when someone breaks at least one of them .
In Brazil , the social rules like vocal patterns reflect in the communication values which can be decisive to keep a good communication .
Also , the personal territory are governed by rules that vary depending on the country , and in Brazil are considered small , but everyone there appreciates this cultural value .
Eye contact is another important cultural value which is used by Brazilians meaning respect and interest for others .
As in Brazil , each country around the world has reflections of the unwritten rules in the cultural values .
Respecting these rules is the first step to understand them and avoid some conflicts .
In addition , you should avoid judge cultural values from other countries based on unwritten rules of your own .
It was a rainy Monday afternoon and Michael was gazing out the window thinking about his life , when he saw his friend , John , dashing through the street .
- I 'm late for my piano lesson ! I really have to go , see you later - John replied panting .
Michael had a chemestry test the next day , however he was n't in the mood to study and so he decided to call Alex , his best friend :
- To be perfectly honest I do n't really like it there !
what about the one next to the shopping center ?
- Souds great .
Michael grabbed his coat and creept out of his house in order not to wake up his parents .
He remembered that he still had n't studied for his chemestry test .
According to Ferguson et all ( 2013 ) , dietary nitrate ( NO3- ) supplementation , via its reduction to nitrite ( NO2- ) and subsequent conversion to nitric oxide ( NO ) , reduces blood pressure .
Thus , the induced vasodilation may affect both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after the exercise .
Nevertheless , a study of The New England Journal of Medicine claims that only the diastolic blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplement , once it was not found in their study a significant change on systolic blood pressure after nitrate supplementation in healthy volunteers .
Thus , the investment on research about the influence of nitrate supplementation should continue , the aim of which would be to improve sports performance and improved quality of life .
Importantly , it was not found serious changes in blood lactate levels either .
It was assumed that beetroot juice would increase the oxidation and would reduce the lactate production .
Nevertheless , the nitrate supplementation did not change the lactate level significantly .
Finally , it was confirmed that nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels , consequently reducing the blood pressure .
Despite the present findings , it is necessary more research to understand the effects of nitrate supplementation .
By this action , athletes may improve their performance as well as quality of life .
Due to the fact that I am studying to become a teacher , I have some more knowledge about this subject than any other people because I am in the school classroom every day and I face the reality of it every day .
To begin with , I agree with you that technology sometimes makes the educational process easier and more pleasant in this way that students have no idea that they broaden their knowledge .
Of course , I make use of computer and projector during my teaching daily , because this is a pleasant and entertaining activity for children .
After all , my objection is that interactive learning is not the only way for children to be educated .
The traditional educational process may sometimes seem to be boring and dull for children but a teacher should be a part of this process as a guide .
Without teachers ' guidance , self- studying may bring some problems to children , such as possible misunderstanding .
Networking educational contents are not safe at all .
It is common for children to watch violence scenes .
Nowadays , young people graduate from universities , who come up with new and innovative ideas about educational process and so the tradition will be updated next years .
To be more precise , new educational methods promotes the students ' teamwork .
In other words , students have the opportunity to discuss with their classmates in order to solve a mathematic problem in cooperation or to talk about a subject .
Furthermore , when it 's necessary good students can help the other classmates to improve themselves .
In this kind of education , teacher is only the guide who helps students to discover the information on their own .
In contrast , interactive learning may bring some advantages but it can also makes children antisocial , because they learn on their own without the need to be in the school with other people .
This is bad , because it will be necessary to work as team in their future job and then they will face serious communicative problems .
My personal opinion is this is not sufficient to cover the education process .
This is a good option especially during the summer time .
Also this is a healthy way of getting fit .
One of these is athleticism . "
Campo de Marte " is one of the few places in Lima where you can practise athleticism professionally .
You can practise it in a semi- Olympic swimming pool , which is always clean and protected against the sunlight .
I strongly recommend young people to choose sports in which you can take part of a team .
This experience would teach you how to work with different kind of people .
Dear Mr Michael Wallis ,
Thank you so much for this opportunity , I am very grateful for everything .
I think English is in fact very important because first of all although not being the most spoken language in the world , it is the official language in a large number of countries .
Most of the content produced on the internet ( 50% ) is in English and last but not least although learning English can be challenging and steals some of our precious time , we can see that it is also very valuable to learn and can also create many opportunities .
About the accommodation , we talked and decided that we would prefer to be with English speaking families because of what a great opportunity it is for everyone to actually test their speaking skills .
I was actually about to email you about the activities that are to be planned .
Regarding the students preferences , they all love the outdoors , like parks and rivers and they also love a good museum because of their thirst for knowledge .
All in all , anything that will keep them away from being bored and with nothing to do .
Concerning this amazing trip I only have two questions left starting with the weather , considering your experience with the changes happening this time of the year and the second and last about what type of clothes you recommended which is of great importance primarily for our female students .
On the positive side , travelling by car is more relaxed because you do not have to rely on others to drive for you .
Actually you have more freedom in which roads to choose and you can have breaks whenever you feel a need for some time off the street .
Going by train for example , you need to get to the next train station and afterwards from the destination train station to your target .
Often enough you have to rely on other services such as busses or taxis to reach your destination .
On the other hand , using public transportation is good for the environment because the amount of gas , electricity and other materials is a lot lower per head .
Furthermore you have the chance to take a nap , do some work or watch TV while you are being transported .
Moreover you can be lucky to avoid big traffic jams especially if you are taking the train .
Avoiding traffic jams , construction sites , accidents and other obstacles you may being affected by may result in a lower amount of time spent travelling .
As a conclusion you can say public transport will have its use even in the future . While going by car may be more comfortable from time to time , the reasons I stated above lead me to the conclusion that public transport is necessary .
It is popularly believed that the golden era of public transportation will be ended soon due to the heavy use of automobiles such as cars , cabs and vans .
On the other hand , travelling by car is getting for popular than it ever was with development of science and technology .
People who are based on rural and remote areas are always prefer to use public transportation according to the researchers from Columbia University .
However , in some countries , public transportation is a nightmare because it has not been maintained by the governments properly , this is one of the main reasons which had led people to use personal vehicles rather than relying on public transportation .
Not only people in countries where it has poor public transportation but also the most developed countries , there is a high tendency of using cars instead of depending on public transportation .
Despite the fact that using cars being expensive , many people still prefer to use their own vehicles because it saves their valuable time .
Public transportation , on the other hand , consumes a lot of time to travel from one distance to another .
Higher power efficiency and linearity cause decrease power consumption , increase lifetime and reduction of interference channels .
Class - E power amplifier satisfies those goals with linearity techniques .
Class - E power amplifier PAs work as a switch and can obtain theoretically 100% power efficiency . Class - E power amplifier ( PA ) was introduced by Sokal in 1975 .
These PAs work as a switch and can obtain 100% Drain Efficiency theoretically .
However in practice there are some limitations such as , switch on - resistance and various power losses that prevent achieving 100% Drain Efficiency .
Secret agents have often been chosen as the main character of stories and films , such as James Bond 's ones , which managed to be really successful .
There could be a lot of reasons , like the idea of living in an adventurous way or doing things in secret ; but in real life , what kind of person does a secret agent have to be ?
In the same way a secret agent has to be able to take risks when required .
Therefore bravery is very important : nobody needs a fearful spy .
A secret agent works undercover , so his most important quality is possessing great skill in lying .
