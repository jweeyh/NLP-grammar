My town is a medium - sized city with eighty thousand inhabitants .
It has a high - density population because of its small territory .
Although it is an industrial city , there are many shops and department stores .
I recommend visiting the artificial lake in the center of the city which is surrounded by a park .
Pasteries are very common and most of them offer the special dessert of the city .
There is a commercial zone along the widest street of the city where you can find all kinds of businesses : banks , bars , chemists , cinemas , pet shops , restaurants , fast food restaurants , grocers , travel agencies , supermarkets and others .
Most of the shops have sales and offers in at least three months of the year : January , June and August .
The quality of the products and services is quite good , because there is huge competition . However , I recommend you be careful of fakes or cheats .
Some people want to be a doctor , others want to be a teacher .
I have my own plan too , but I do n't want to be the same as them . I want to become a journalist .
Working as a journalist is very exciting for many reasons .
Second , I can travel all around the world , and meet different people who are very friendly .
Next , I will have a chance to attend big parties or events and I can make friends with famous people . It 's interesting !
Finally , I will have a high salary when I am a journalist .
To be a journalist , I must study very hard , so I 'll try to learn in order to make my dream come true .
Nowadays , each family has more than 1 car for each person , this is only one of several reasons why people use less public transport .
Before , it was really convenient to go by bus or by train , but with the new economy , the fares are more expensive and a big difference from the past is that it is less expensive to go long - distance than short journeys .
I remember to go from my town , Palermo , to Milan was about 340 pounds . Now , if we are lucky , we can get to New York .
In England , where I live , in Bedford , we use the train a lot to go to the most important towns in the UK , but the trains are very expensive . Me and my family are careful to go off peak because the prices are too high .
I 'm sure in the future there will be cars that are able to fly or you can park them in your pocket .
The possible reason is these international students can not speak English fluently .
They usually lack language and can not start a debate .
On the other hand , they might want to safeguard the national image .
MORE THAN KEEP FIT !
Do you know about mountain biking ?
Carry on reading to know why !
I have been keen on mountain biking since three years ago .
First , I tried it with a rental bike in the area of Aznalcazar .
The main reason why I wanted to try it was to lose weight ( I was a bit overweight ) .
Consequently , I realized that although cycling outside helped me to improve my fitness , really I enjoyed most breathing fresh air and taking pleasure in the countryside .
If someone wants to take up this sport , first of all , I would recommended him or her to look for a good mountain bike .
It 's important to avoid accidents , be comfortable and have a good journey .
Secondly , he or she should buy a good helmet and , of course , appropriate clothing .
I love this sport . I look forward to the weekend to go out with my bike and my group of friends .
All of us have a good time .
And I would like to encourage everybody to try it .
Nobody will regret it .
Lucy Keyes was the last thriller I saw .
I do n't recommend it to children under thirteen years old ,
The movie is about Lucy 's family , who move into a farmhouse that is mysterious and
from a story their mom often reads .
The story actually takes place in a camp and a farmhouse , mysteriously
had a weird painting of two sisters just like hers , and the same ones too as the
The best place for young people in our area is without doubt the lake .
At least they can meet other folks and relax , sunbathe and listen to music .
In the summer around the lake , there are so many concerts that you have difficulty finding the right one .
Luckily , the schools are closed for ten weeks , so the young girls and boys have a lot of time to spend their
Leaving my country , Somalia , was very hard for me .
I miss my big house , but I do n't miss the guns .
In the following decades , revolution and civil wars smote many of the Powers of Europe , and new nations were born .
I really like to travel , but I like it most when I travel with friends .
Travelling with family is different to travelling with friends .
I do not travel so much with my friends .
I have only traveled two times .
Those two times were with the orchestra that I play in .
At that time , I did not know anybody , just one person .
But when I was there , I began to make new friends that I never thought I would have , and I never imagined the way that I was going to know them either . At the beginning , I felt very strange talking with them , but now we are very good friends .
We stayed in Zacatecas for a week . We really had a good time .
We went to to Acapulco to play , to an event where universities from Mexico go and present cultural activities .
It was too hot there .
In Acapulco I had a good time because I stayed in the same room as my friends and we swam a lot and we really had fun .
There we visited the central park and we stayed in a very luxurious hotel .
We were very happy there . We really liked Taxco .
Actually , I had already been there before , but not with my friends .
Then we went to Cacahuamilpa to play there . That was an incredible experience that I will never forget .
Then we returned to Toluca to continue with my boring life .
In biathlon , sportsmen need to run some races which are very different ; some of them are long , some are short .
But , the fact that it is short distance does n't mean it will be easy or anything like that .
Sometimes the weather conditions are not comfortable for guys . For example : wind , light fog or freezing temperatures . All of these are very difficult conditions .
So , it 's not so easy as it seems .
This sport is for real men .
And also most of them are very attractive . A big advantage for girls , who like nice pictures .
That is what everyone says when we ask if they prefer public transport or car .
Using public transport can be difficult , because we have a strict time and , normally , we do not have a place to sit and that can be extremely uncomfortable .
Sometimes the staff go on strike and we customers do not know in time . As a result , we can not get to work on time . That is one of the disadvantages of using public transport .
One argument for not using the car is that petrol is very expensive , but public transport tickets are also increasing , so that advantage is not so good , actually .
For me , the car is the best . And you ?
Well , whatever your choice is , it must be perfect for your daily life !
Whatever you use , have a nice trip !
People usually tell me I 'm a cinema enthusiast , and they are right . I prefer to spend my free time watching a good film , especially when it is a thriller , rather than doing sport ,
If you want to see a good thriller , " Regression " will be your best option . I have seen it recently and , in my opinion , it should be seen by everyone , because I believe people would like it for many reasons .
First of all , the director , who was Alejandro Amen√°bar , did a great job because the viewers were waiting with bated breath to find out what the ending of this film would be .
Secondly , the actors were fantastic and the main character , who was played by Emma Watson ( who is really hilarious ) , was amazing .
What 's more , the plot is easy to understand .
The story took place in the USA a few years ago when the regression method was accepted by doctors and scientists .
In addition , the costumes , make - up and special effects the story .
However , the soundtrack was awful ; it did n't get having a scared .
In conclusion , my recommendation for the student film club is this fabulous and exciting thriller , which must be seen if you want to have a good time , given that it achieves keeping you in suspense until the end and it does n't be afraid .
In addition , you wo n't have a better opportunity to see it than this week , because just now in Spain the cinema festival is taking place .
In my opinion , public transport in my country will never improve , because my country is so poor and , besides , it is considered one of the Third World countries . And another thing that must be taken into consideration is that the politicians are horrible . They have destroyed my country .
When we ask ourselves how we can take care of the environment ,
the first thing that we think of is the pollution , the car exhaust , factory smoke , etc ... but , have we thought about food or clothes ?
Perhaps when we are shopping in the supermarket or other shops we are doing something bad , because we ask the assistant for a bag or something similar to carry this food or other things home .
We could bring a bag from our house , because if we do this every time that we are going to shop in each shop , we wo n't use more plastic or paper .
But we should n't forget the pollution cause by cars . We should use a bicycle or public transportation more .
Also , in the same way , we should walk to our destination .
If we are working with someone in the same job who lives near us or is our neighbour , we can go to work in the same car . This way we use less petrol .
The governments are also important for taking care of the environment .
They should have healthy habits and , by their example , they can improve the habits of the population .
I love sports but I do not get many opportunities to play a sport . I was born in a village in India . My parents are farmers like most other villagers .
The only playground in our village was the school ground which was full of small rocks and not good for playing any sports .
When I was a child I helped my father with his jobs after school .
We bought a television in 1888 . After that , I became a fan of cricket .
I watched most of the matches .
Sachin and Ganguly were my favorite cricketers . I love their batting .
It was the summer holidays and Michael 's family were at the airport waiting impatiently for their flight to Mexico .
That was a special family ; it was so big . His father has 6 brothers , so he has 17 cousins and his little sister .
In total , there were 32 people , a white kitten and a dog .
About 10 minutes later , they were starting to get bored , when they heard a girl calling them to board the plane .
Michael usually had a great time with his cousins , except with Tom .
That was because Tom liked to give orders to everyone , and Michel did n't like that .
When the big family got off the plane , they realized that they were wearing too many clothes ; it was boiling ! !
Then they took a taxi to the hotel , and at 4 pm ,
Some minutes later , they designated how the cousins were going to share the rooms .
Michael finally ended up with the last one he would like to share with ; Tom .
That night , the dog , the kitten , Tom and Michel slept in the same room , and that was n't too bad .
When Michael got up in the morning , he realized that his kittten had disappeared , and he found Tom 's dog with some white hair in his mouth .
He thought that the dog had eaten the kitten during the night , so he shouted at Tom , opened the door and went away .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Warm candlelight and small tables with patterned table cloths create a friendly atmosphere .
I believe it is suitable for our class
So , my favourite sport at the present time is street workout . I have been doing this sport for a long time already .
I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside is below zero .
Of course , in summer , I like to exercise more than in winter , but this does n't stop me .
I do n't know why , but I go on the street almost every day in order to exercise .
If it is very cold and wind outside , I do n't worry about it and I exercise at home .
For those people who want to start to do the street workout , I advise you to start with basic exercises such as pull ups , push ups , dips and squats .
These are all basic exercises and they will help you make a good start .
After some time , when you feel that you are ready for more , you can start to do more difficult exercises .
I was quite self - confident a few months ago .
But not now .
Sometimes , a lot of phrases and sentences run around my head , but how to write them down correctly ?
How can I use it ?
How can I force my kids to do their homework ?
How can I explain to them ?
Michael got married to his close friend only one month ago .
But his mother hated his wife and always shouted at her .
In contrast , his wife respected and loved his mother and never complained to her husband about these bad situations .
Michael 's only fault is that he is a mamma 's boy .
Because of this , he always defended his mother and always said the wife was the one responsible .
His wife decided , because she loved him , to forgive and apologize to her mother - in - law .
One day when Michael was out at work , his mother insulted and hit his wife .
Moreover , she fired her without her mobile or money .
His wife was sad and she cried a lot and she stood in the street waiting for Michael .
When he came , his mother asked him to up quickly , pretending that she was tired .
He saw his wife but said no words to her and continued on his way .
His wife walked behind him until they reached home but his mother claimed that his wife said cruel words to her and pretended that she was crying .
Michael believed his mother , although he observed bruises on his wife 's face .
She was shocked and apologized for a mistake she did not commit .
The light bulb was created in 1879 by Thomas Alva Edison .
This was one of the everyday inventions that affects our lives .
Edison is said to have created the first commercially practical incandescent light .
Some historians claim there were 20 other inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Edison 's version , but Edison is often credited with the invention because his version was able to outstrip the earlier versions because of a combination of three factors : " an effective incandescent material , a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable . "
Edison began serious research into the incandescent light bulb in October of 1878 , and his original design was in 1879 .
Edison and his research team made his discovery commercially and create a company called " Edison Electric Light Company " .
I think what this is the most useful invention because without this we ca n't live like we live these days .
Tom , a friend of Peter 's suddenly fainted and fell down in the class room . I did n't know what to do immediately . First , I calmed myself down and I checked his pulse . It was okay . Then I knew that he was out of danger , so I called my classmates . Everyone came rushing to the spot , but still he was not moving , so we decided to take him to the hospital or call an ambulance . Finally we called an ambulance without delay .
Everyone was eagerly waiting for the ambulance 's arrival , but it still had not yet reached us . The reason was our college location is quite far from the city . That 's why it was late .
We were waiting patiently . Finally , the ambulance arrived and took him to the hospital immediately .
Recently I saw a very interesting announcement in International Sports Monthly magazine .
I was interested in whether I could write such an article and win a prize .
Nowadays , a healthy way of life is very popular with most people all over the world .
And as for me , I 've been going in for sport for several years .
I want to be fit and have good health .
Go to sports centres and gyms , be active and you will feel different .
If you do n't have exercise for a long time , your body will feel something unusual .
Your muscles will be strong and you 'll be able to do any difficult job .
The walls of my bedroom are white and the floor is dark grey .
In my bedroom there is a brown bed , a yellow chest of drawers , a little light brown bedside table and a big brown wardrobe .
On the wall there are some pictures of my family , but I do n't have any posters .
I live in S√£o Carlos , in the countryside of S√£o Paulo , in Brazil .
In my city , protecting the environment is so difficult .
First of all , we have an extinction area of cerrado close to the Federal University of S√£o Carlos , but sometimes , the area is used to construct a new university building .
We have done several movements , but sometimes it has not worked .
Secondly , the council does n't care about the environment ; for example , the council stopped the garbage collection when the new mayor took over the council .
It demonstrated that the effort that was made in the last 10 years was over because of the new political position of the mayor .
It is so stupid because the environment needs to be more important than political positions .
Third , we have not founded a green policy to eliminate rubbish .
Instead of using selective collection of garbage , or recycling of materials , or a sanitary landfill , we have used a dumpfill that is contaminating the soil .
Finally , the population , most of the time , does n't matter to throw away garbage on the street or in a prohibited area .
In conclusion , in my city , concern for the environment 's protection is not working as it should for the protection of soil , environment and health .
The environment is our surroundings . There is no awareness in our locality . They are busy with their own work . No one focuses on or sees what is happening in our town . They usually speak about how hot it is today , but they do n't know what makes it this hot . I am interested in planting trees and making our surroundings clean . Some people used to burn the forest as if the forest is useless . Man is greedy because all the things we get from the forests are free .
They do n't care about the environment because it does n't give anything to them .
Management accounting practice is very important for an organization for making decisions about human resources , sales , marketing and potential customers .
Most organizations know how management accounting practice affects their work . Therefore , they choose good programmes and employees .
I was in the USA last year , first in order to look for a job as a pharmacist , but also , having a lot of time to explore a new world .
At first , I called a travel agent but he said he would n't be able to book me a flight for two months , so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip , and he told me he would book a flight sooner than that good - for - nothing travel agent .
I believed him , but I did n't know how wrong I was .
He booked me the flight but he did n't pay for it , because at that moment he had n't got enough cash on him .
The worst thing was finding that out at the airport .
The environment is always a hurting problem in the world .
There are company so much , they , they make our life polluted .
To take care of the environment , each of us has to do something such as propaganda to the people in the country . About my village , we use banana leaves instead of nylon , dispose of garbage sensibly ... and so on .
We should clean our area to attract visitors and introduce to many other countries in the world . Let 's protect our lung .
Hi , today I 'm gon na talk about myself .
I live in Saudi Arabia(Riyadh ) , and I 'm in grade nine .
I have 9 sisters , with me we are 10 girls , and 9 brothers .
I really love learning English language & French language and Spanish language , and I speak Arabic .
My dear Daniel ,
Are you studying mathematics for your exam ?
I have just finished my lunch break , and before preparing everything to go to work , I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a little surprise with these fantastic photos . I hope you like them .
I 'm a happy , energetic person who likes to work with children .
This summer several things happened to me . I went to the beach , I went to the pool , or simply went for a walk with friends , but the best thing was when I went to a wedding , because it was the event that brought me the most memories this summer .
We got there at five o'clock . We had not yet reached many people , so we took the opportunity to give the gift , which was a washing machine the finished clothing to reach the store , and apparently they were in need of a new one , as the bride loved .
Half an hour after we arrived , everybody started arriving , there were many greetings , thanks , hugs , kisses , and then we all went to the table , which was magnificently stocked , with plenty of food of all kinds , drinks , but we were all waiting for the main course . Also , the food was magnificent , but the best part was when the couple went to the pool . We were lucky they had an amazing wedding planner who arranged magnificent and fun activities . He said to the bride and groom that they should each get into an inflatable ball and try walking on the water for as long as they could , and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them , out of the ball , fell into the water , and kissed .
At four in the morning , after opening the presents , everyone started to leave . It was a long day and a lot of fun , but it could have lasted a bit longer .
I usually wake up at six o'clock in the morning , then I take a quick shower .
After school , I like to eat fresh fruit .
I am keen on running during the night time .
In my country people make a lot of mistakes and have a lot of bad habits concerning their attitude towards rubbish . They are always throwing their old things and rubbish away in public places . The government also can not do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour .
Once upon a time , there was a monster in a city called " Michenstain " .
Michenstain was a very tiny city . That was one bad thing for them ; the other bad thing was that in the city , there was a monster called " Monsteration " .
Monsteration was a very lively monster . He always migrated to the north every Monday .
In the day , he was a mild monster , he was very visible ( because he was big ) ; but in the night , he was the opposite . He killed people , destroyed complete cities ; he smashed all the architecture of the city , and did a lot of bad things .
None of the people knew what that was , so they did n't care about it .
But when he arrived in Michenstain , all the people went : " DAHMMMMMMMMMM " .
It was in the middle of the night when he arrived , so he was eager to destroy everything .
He was spoiling all the people 's crops , he was destroying all the vehicles , and he destroyed a vast area .
The next day , he was a very attractive monster . In other words , he was undercover in another monster 's body .
The thing that he ( the monster ) did n't know about was that he had a spectacular infection ( literally spectacular ) that I think had no cure . It was called " The Monsteration Infections " .
( In those times , there were diverse monsters , but none of them was like him ; he was the number 1 of the monsters at destroying things . )
Scientists were trying to find a cure for the Monsteration Infections , but they still do n't have it .
In their laboratories , they had a lot of chemicals that were prohibited in their country , but they used them .
They had to isolate the chemicals to find the formula to have the cure .
Some scientists did n't care about the infection ; they were playing ultimate team on their iPods .
The scientists that were making the formula had a lot of tension , but finally , they did it and they said : " Magnificent " .
Well I 'd like to talk to you about my experiences as an English student for many years .
I have needed to use English a lot of times during my professional activities . For that reason I took some English lessons many years ago .
I can tell you that I feel I can understand over 90% when I 'm listening and when I 'm reading , but my main problem with English is , of course , when I have to speak . I fee terrible and without confidence . I think that I 'm always thinking in Spanish and then doing the translation into English . Maybe at this moment , while I 'm writing this composition , I 'm making the same mistake . I know that learning English is a long process , but I must follow that process because I 'd like to be an excellent bilingual person .
Currently , I 'm working as a teacher at the university and teaching in English is my goal .
I 'm a teacher of chemistry and math too .
I also work as a freelance worker with the same subjects because it is necessary to increase my income .
I 'm writing now without using a dictionary and doing this composition without translating from Spanish ( I hope hahaha )
I 'm sure I 'll have made many mistakes , but I feel good because I must write and write and write . I need to improve my English level . I must not feel bad if I want to finally learn English very well .
I hope you can help me understand more about how to improve my English level and develop my skills .
Thank you for your attention , and I 'll wait for your advice , ( this is my first time writing over 50 words )
I like to work out on push up bars .
It is impossible not to love doing sports activity in the fresh air .
If you want to start working out , you should be ready for a big load on your muscles .
In the afternoon , I went to my dance classes .
It was fun because we learnt a new hip hop dance and we finished our tap dance .
I bought one sweater and two pairs of jeans .
Later I went to the book store and bought three books ; " Legend " , " Wonder " , and " Eleanor & Park " .
On the weekend I stayed at home . I started reading " Eleanor & Park " ; it was amazing . I laughed a lot because of the things that the characters said .
The other things I did were sleep , eat , and watch TV .
The next day , I went with my friends to see a movie .
We saw " If I stay " and I loved it .
The movie is about a teenager named Mia who had a car accident with her family .
Her father and her mother died before they got to the hospital .
Mia survived but she is in a coma and she has to decide if she wants to live without her mother and father or if she wants to die .
Later in the week , I spent the day drawing .
I drew a meadow , a little girl , and a butterfly .
The next few days I did n't do much .
I just slept and watched movies at home .
The day before I started school , I did an investigation for literature class .
This was what I did in my vacation . I did n't do a lot but I loved my vacation .
Serbia is my country where I have been living for 24 years .
If you would like and wish to come here my best advice is to stay at home .
As per today 's topic , " No Future for public transport " , I would like to add comments on that . Please be patient , as my English is not as good as you readers think .
So , let 's start .
Most of the Metro cities are nowadays attract city - dwellers towards the Metro , not only because of the fare , but because of the time that it saves .
Nowadays , the public do not like to travel on public transport to save time as well as money .
The Metro is even good for the health of the people as there is no pollution because it runs on electricity and it also connects most of the city . As Delhi has a wide area span of Metro that is really awesome .
Other than that , public transport is also not good for natural resources , which is not good for the future of the country .
If you visit Taiwan , you ca n't miss the temples here .
So , now there is a chance for you to play the god .
Jiu - Tian Folk Arts Group is a group of people who are good at our traditional performance , which is " imitating the faces and posing as gods " .
Here , they will teach you how to draw the face of god , dance like god , and beat the drum .
I think paying expensive taxes on personal cars could reduce the use of cars or other vehicles in order to solve the traffic problems .
Because all people like money , for example , many people do n't buy a car with expensive tax , so people have to use public transportation , such as buses , the subway , etc .
Public transportation will rich , so we can build more stations for suburban and more public car to carry this .
Therefore , the traffic will be better .
Dear Sir / Madam
I am 29 years old , and originally from Brazil .
I am an English student and I have been studying for five years , and recently , I passed the FCE , which is a well recognised certificate .
In 2010 , I graduated in electronic engineering .
From June to September of 2013 , I worked for a tourism company . My position involved looking after groups of people going to England . This previous experience makes me suitable for the job advertised .
In addition to this , personally I am really helpful , exciting , cheerful and committed .
I do sports such as football , basketball and chess , and with these skills , I could help children have fun while teaching them all the benefits of doing sport .
In applying for the job offered , I am willing to work in all different sorts of jobs . I do not mind which , as long as I have the opportunity of being in the USA , as English is my passion .
To sum up , I feel rather confident to assume this position and thank you for considering my application .
Yours faithfully ,
There is no way to travel from Egypt to the USA using a car .
A plane may take about 16 hours .
A car may take days or months for the same distance .
I am really overwhelmed to be the third member of my small family- Peter , Maria , both of whom are my parents of 45 years of age and my little brother , Patrick-14 years old in a mischievous manner .
Their gentle norm with lovely and adorable minds are a reference to their hobbies - reading .
Nowadays a person 's worth seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions . This mostly happens in high class families , as they focus on achievements like power , political influence etc . On the other hand , for middle class families the old - fashioned values are still important as they are inherited from our ancestors in terms of values like honesty , kindness , loyalty , etc .
The metro is the most comfortable means of transportation in Moscow .
The metro is the only one that I use in the city .
Using overground transportation is not comfortable because of the traffic .
Just a few years ago , we started to use a special road line .
But the problem is , Russian drivers are not used to keeping this line free .
There is no difference if you use a car or the bus .
For example , American public transport has a special line and a schedule and it works like a train . I mean it comes at an exact time , like a train .
That 's my dream " when I joined the faculty of languages and translation I was very happy because I had achieved my dream .
In this faculty , I faced some problems with my English . I began to ask " How can I improve my English ? "
all of the answers were , " you have to listen and read so you can write and speak well " . I said okay I have to depend on myself . I began to join groups on Facebook where I found some of the people shared their knowledge with others . I followed them immediately .
I am on my way to improving my English . I ask Allah to guide me to the right way .
to teach children and adults in my country good English , and I want to avoid traditional education .
The best thing that can encourage me to open this center is that I have 5 friends in my country who study in the faculty of languages and translation and I think that they will be very happy about joining me in my center .
I know that is a really amazing dream , but I pray to Allah to give me all the means to achieve my future dream .
Alex , I and my friends are going to the cinema at the weekend .
Would you like to join us ?
We are going to see an action movie .
If you want to join us , we can meet in Ambasodor mall in the city at 7 p.m.
Public transport has no future . The crisis in 2008 has reduced oil prices , The oil is cheap now and new cars are more efficient and the government give incentives for consumers .
One day in October , Michael , a boy who was studying architecture discovered a box with a message . While he was opening the box , he heard a door open .
At that moment , a big man came into the bedroom .
This man was his father , who was dead .
Michael was very agitated and confused because he did n't understand anything .
He spoke with his father and he asked him why he was there , and his father replied that he had the biggest secret about his family .
" In the past , Matilde , your mother , killed your brother , but she had a reason . He was a monster because he killed a lot of people in our city , so we went to another city . "
This situation was impossible because his father was dead and , at that moment , he ran and opened the door and his father said " You must stay here , because I must speak with you more and explain why I can speak with you " . But Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Dear Mrs Ashby ,
I want to work in your cafe .
I like a lot of food and drink .
I worked in a cafe last year in my country . I can work long hours .
Today we received a shipment from Visual service center under our old account number . It could be a mistake by the service center as a notice regarding major organizational restructure has already been sent to service centers .
In the issued notice , it clearly states that all defective parts should be sent to Slovakia with effect from 01/06/2015 .
If any more shipments are returned using our old TNT account number , there is no option other than to invoice the service center for not following instructions .
So , please advise all service centers to return defective parts to Slovakia instead of England .
Nowadays , sport is a very important part of our life .
Many doctors recommend the practicing of sport , because it is very healthy for our bodies and for our minds .
Every day , there are many articles and news items that talk about the benefits that you get if you practise sport .
My favourite sport is swimming , because as soon as you start this sport , you feel better .
Even if you do n't lose weight , you can gain endurance and flexibility .
When I am in water , I feel free and very hastily .
Not only is sport when you feel sweaty , but you also do a lot of exercise .
However , you do n't have the feeling that you are very tired . It is different , at the same time , it is fantastic !
My advice that I would give to someone starting my favourite sport , swimming , is that you need a little willpower , because sometimes , for example in winter , you will not want to go to the gym , let alone get in a pool !
My other advice is that I am absolutely sure that you will feel wonderful and happy ! May be not the first time , but definitely later .
In conclusion , sport is absolutely necessary and useful for you to be able to improve your life .
Start and then you can explain to me how you are .

Nowadays , we are in the age of the internet .
A flat world is created by the internet .
We can get knowledge more easily and we learn more easily , too .
This is the power of information technology .
The social networks , such as Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , Google plus ... are connecting us to more and more friends , companies , public figures , books , films , social organizations ... . We really have a lot of things to see , to think , to " like " , to " comment " on and dozens of other ways that we can make an action to interact with others . So , maybe it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves , to take care of our health .
They help us to communication with the world and we have only twenty hours a day . We know more things but we lose more time for many other interesting things .
But it just happen in the information technology and related fields such as : communication .
On the other hand , we still have a lot of other technologies to create a lot of useful machines , on - side services to make our life better and better day by day .
Transportation helps us go abroad more quickly , even go into space on a tour .
It is amazing for you , if you have enough money , to pay for that tour .
We feel more happy , comfortable and refreshed after something like that .
Biotechnology gives us more food .
Yes , we are solving many problems with our technology for our feeling , our health and our finances , too .
You can join any stock market in the world to buy some Google stocks and sell some Facebook stocks too , and earn some money .
You take the world in your hands with technology to make your life better and better actually , but it is not full that it will good , let keep it with your needs , your time and your money too .
We are worried that if the trees do n't get planted soon they will never grow again .
That is the reason why we are going to plant 1000 trees there .
Egypt has a lot of historical places , such as the pyramids , and is the one of the empirical in the world and a lot of people from around the world come to see these pyramids . the wold think about how the Egyptian people made these buildings maybe a thousand years and they still stand without change and a lot of tourists come to take photos in the pyramids and study the stone and how the old Egyptians made them without modern tools such as cranes and other modern machines . A lot of scientific teams come from all over the world to study these buildings and conduct Egyptian science in a lot of universities around the world , to study how the air goes inside these buildings and how it keeps the food inside it and how these big stones were taken from distant places and brought to this place and how this building kept the bodies of people after they had died and how these people live inside the buildings and why these buildings are like this and what the benefit of these buildings is and how to make kike this building .
Public transport has improved regional development in the past decade . It 's convenient and necessary for city life .
But when it comes to travelling , it 'll be more convenient if you have a car , because you will not want to go where everybody goes .
And , there 's really enough development on our planet . It would be better if we could leave some place empty , we do n't need so much convenient transportation , and we can still live well .
Save some nature for the earth , and leave clean air for our kids .
Build public transport in a city , not in the country .
My favorite sport is Cricket .
It is a very important and very enjoyable game .
Today , cricket is a very famous game in the world .
Cricket is very famous in Sri Lanka .
It is really great .
Today we have cleverer cricketers and more famous umpires than other countries .
Australia , England , South Africa and New Zealand are very famous countries for cricket .
But those countries are very developed and they have many facilities .
But Sri Lanka is a developing country still .
We have no facilities like other countries .
But Sri Lanka 's cricket team won the World Cup in 2014 .
It is very important opportunities in our country .
So I think I can enjoy cricket more than other games .
You can start playing cricket game .
Today we have lots of sports .
Volleyball , netball , Elle , table tennis , Karate , etc .
But they are not famous and we ca n't go to everywhere in the world .
But cricket is very famous and we know many cricketers .
We can be famous and earn more money .
Cricket is better for our health than other games .
In my opinion , cricket is best for you . You could be a good cricketer .
If I am right , continue reading this .
We have a lot of shopping facilities , that is the good thing about living in a big city like Madrid , because we have a lot of different shops including clothes shops , pet shops , food shops , shoe shops , accessory shops , toy shops , present shops and any more types of shops that now I can not remember , but you can find almost all you want or you need . Is n't it incredible ?
But for some of them you have to search very thoroughly because some of the shops are unique and some others are very well hidden , but for that you have specialized transport that will take you to wherever you want or you need to go .
I worked backstage at a rock concert !
I applied to a music club in our city and I was really excited when they replied and asked me to help , because I enjoy going to rock concerts and I was truly curious about how the backstage works .
What was my job ?
Mostly I helped others and carried stuff .
People were singing and shouting - they all seemed to be really happy .
I hope I will do that again sometime .
See you around
It 's the heart of Poland and you will learn everything about work , education and people here .
Every big city in Poland is very similar to the others .
If you want to relax you can also go to the mountains or sea .
Even there , you can meet really nice people and talk with them .
But let 's talk about working there .
We appreciate kind and hard - working people .
My name is Agustina L√≥pez . I was born in 1999 on 12th April .
Last year I celebrated my fifteen party and I loved it very much , ( I want to celebrate it again ) .
This year is my sixteenth birthday and I 'm going to celebrate at home , with my family and some friends .
I love to do many things like sleeping , going dancing with my friends , going to the beach , cinema , shopping center , running , and I love fashion very much , like shoes , make - up , bags and clothes .
This summer was the best . I went to Cuchilla Alta with my best friends . Their names are : Emilia , Agustina , Micaela and Luc√≠a .
I went to the beach . We loved it .
I like English because it is very important to know other languages to communicate with other people and if I go to another country it is very important to know English .
I think that it is very interesting and I like it .
Dear penfriend ,
I hope this letter finds you well .
Well , I am writing to tell you about my last summer .
I had a really nice experience working in a cinema . I would n't have done it if my friend Lucy had n't encouraged me .
The staff were really interesting and helped me all the time and the customers were kind all the time .
I learnt lots of things , such as dealing with money and tickets and watched movies for free .
We got to work at four in the afternoon and it was very relaxing . I had a day off when I spent time at home or going to the gym , where I met handsome guys .
I recommend you to try this kind of job if you want to earn extra money and also meet new people .
Lots of hugs and kisses . Please write soon
In this essay I would like to highlight how a wide range of public transport can help people to save a bit of money and a lot of stressful hours stuck in traffic jams .
First , as everybody knows , the cost of fuel is increasing more and more . Adding to that the bills that owning a car will bring , it becomes immediately clear that it is cheaper to get around by public transport .
Why then are there still so many people who prefer to drive their own car instead of sitting comfortably on the train or on the tube reading their favorite book on their way to work ?
I would say that this is because the public transport is not so efficient as it should be .
In my town , for example , I have waited for up to forty minutes before I could get a bus .
I strongly believe that it is a shame because a lot of people like me would leave their vehicles at home and take a train instead .
Secondly , the environment would improve . As far as I can see , the pollution caused by traffic is ruining monuments and making the air dirty and heavy , the same is true as far as waste of time is concerned . Obviously , the fewer cars there are around , the quicker you can get where you want to go .
In conclusion , I would really like politicians who care about public transport to improve the services so that more people could leave their vehicles at home and get around much more easily .
You see , man , I do n't like crowded roads , a nd prefer to travel by tram .
I have been playing basketball on weekends since I was little .
I play basketball and baseball like there is no tomorrow .
I play with them in the playground .
I ca n't imagine life without sports .
In today 's society .
The most people travel by car , because the public transport is not convenient for people to use .
Maybe , in fact , the lands are bigger , so that the transport had not published to anywhere .
The general transport facilities can be divided into three types .
On the land , the railroad and highway are the path through most city roads .
On the sea , including the and port facilities .
In the sky , including airplane flights and airport facilities .
Transport facilities and economic development have a close relationship , and utilized of land is more important .
The development of the railroad and highway are easy to pulished , but the construction of seaports and airports must with congenital condition .
When integration of the economy and land planning are accomplished , the public transport facilities will be convenient for people to use .
I am going to write about how life is going to change in the next 50 years .
Although we do n't realise it , we have to be conscious
that every day is a different day if we compare it with the one that has just passed .
Some years ago , we did n't use technology to get in touch with friends and family , but nowadays it 's the most important thing for
some people who ca n't live without it .
I am speaking about the mobile phone and how it changed our life .
There will be more advantages in general and it will give us a lot of good things , but maybe some bad things too .
To sum up , although we do n't want our life to change , it is normal that it will undergo different changes .
My favourite sport is chess because it is the only game for your mind .
It also helps us in our studies .
I agree that it 's not a physical exercise but a mental one .
There are many physical exercises , like swimming , but name any game except chess that makes our minds sharp .
I like many other games , but the best one is this .
I am not saying that we should always play chess , as physical activities are also important .
The reason why I would recommend someone this sport is that children who are not interested in their studies or would not be able to study .
In that case , chess would help him . It would make the child 's mind sharp and he would not get distracted by his surroundings .
Local transportation is one of the most serious problems in our area .
The local transportation has become difficult and expensive ,
so the government must take action to make it easier .
Public media also must educate people in the importance of local transport and how they can preserve it .
The government must save gasoline and jazz to solve the problem .
They must find a solution to this difficult problem .
They must maintain the roads .
People also have an important role in solving this problem .
They should conserve energy by using buses instead of using their own cars .
They can also walk or ride a bike .
The government must maintain the public transportation and make it safe .
We can solve this problem if we want to .
I thought that writing an article on my favourite sport would be interesting for the readers . Above all , and regardless of the sport you have chosen , it is paramount to do some sport , whatever sport you choose , such as spinning . That is my favourite sport .
My piece of advice for taking up a hobby , in this case a physical hobby , which is good for your health .
I rather enjoy spinning , feeling the rhythm of the music louder and louder . This gives me high energy each time I go spinning .
If you want to start doing some sport , first of all , think about how much time you are willing to spend on it , then try once and if you have a good time , go ahead and make the most of your time enjoying the sport . Nevertheless , be careful and go slowly because you might be injured .
The more sport you do , the better you feel . Indeed , your mood will not be blue anymore and your body will be thin and gorgeous .
If we take a look at the Swiss public transport system , in the bigger cities , almost all people go to work by public transport .
The advantages they get are the following : they do n't have to look for parking possibilities , they can leave the bus or the train and a few minutes after they can begin to work .
These people also help to protect the environment by saving natural resources like petrol .
To conclude , in bigger cities like Bern or Zurich there is no doubt that the public transport system would be less inconvenient than travelling by car .
The process for making bank notes can be outlined in six consecutive steps .
First , the bank notes are considered how to design , including background colour , artwork and security issues .
Then , they are prepared by skilled machinists .
The notes have special ink with colour on both sides , which raises images slightly .
The most important step is inspecting the notes to see which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets .
If the sheets are good , those sheets are then cut into separate bank notes and packed into cars in order to be dispatched all over the city .
If the sheets are bad , those sheets are then destroyed by burning .
Sport is a very important part of a healthy lifestyle .
It keeps our bodies strong .
Today we have a lot of different sports , so we can choose something that really suits us .
It is the kind of thing that anybody can do and it affects all parts of the body .
I literally feel stronger after every time I run .
Public transport offers a possible solution to the problem , because many people can be transported in one vehicle .
The government should raise taxes to pay for the service .
First , I think public transport is more expensive .
And if we compare the money you spend on a car and the amount that you spend on public transport , it is less .
Secondly , if you use a car , you do n't have to wait a long time to catch the bus or the train , and maybe you can arrive late for work in this situation .
I believe that using your car has a lot of advantages or benefits . It is more comfortable and less expensive .
Last summer I worked at a cinema . I think it is a very good job because you can see any films you like for free .
The drawback of this work is the very big salary and I think that I will work at this cinema next summer .
My favourite sport is yoga .
Yoga calms and vitalizes body and mind .
From Monday to Friday , I do it at home . At weekends I attend yoga classes .
We can do it at any time we like .
But if you are a beginner , it 's better for you to attend regular yoga classes .
You can learn correct postures in classes .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years . Equipment and tools have evolved since the beginning of human history .
In recent decades , however , developments have been particularly groundbreaking . Man has been able to invent machines which have been put to work . Automation is a great help to mankind , because it significantly increases the standard of living and frees people from hard work .
The disadvantage , however , is that , because of the machines , many people have lost their jobs .
I read your letter . I would like to know some details about what places you want to visit .
I advise you to visit Queretaro . It has had an excellent service for foreign people since five years ago .
Talking about your new job , I was searching for some vacancies . However , they required a full - time worker , so I am going to continue searching for some part - time jobs .
See you when you arrive in Mexico City
Nowadays , people are constantly on the move .
Is it better to use public transport or private transport ?
Well , ecologists say that getting around using public transport is more beneficial for the environment than using a car or motorbike .
In recent years , the numbers of people who use public transport has increased a lot , in comparison with ten years ago .
But does it actually have a future ?
It 's more comfortable , faster and preferable to having to run to catch a bus , wait for a train , etc .
This is a fact which indicates that there is no future for public transport in our society .
Other signs are , for example , if you travel by car , you can park the car in front of the place where you want to go .
But if you take the bus , you have to get off at a bus stop , which may be a bit far from where you want to go .
Also , it has to be said that maybe in the future , technology will create a car that does n't pollute the air , and then , using public transport wo n't be necessary .
yeah I think this statement is quite right because every person have a car nowadays .
Transport is important , but a car is more reliable for families if they travel together without waiting for transport .
It is more flexible and a lot of fun for a family .
I live in a city named Tangerang . It is in Indonesia .
The Indonesian government itself does n't seem to give a damn about their country 's cleanliness , and do neither the citizens .
This has caused our river some big problems , such as disease , unpleasant smells , floods , etc .
I myself , seeing the river filled with garbage , always seem to be disgusted by the stench and the unpleasant appearance of the garbage .
And in Tangerang , the air is polluted by carbon dioxide and other chemicals .
And also , besides the river , the road in the city is also polluted by garbage .
Garbage everywhere .
The condition of my country is really critical , I think .
And the amount of the city 's parks does n't match the amount of the population and pollution in the city .
There are a lot of high - rise buildings and it causes flooding along the high - rise buildings ' section .
I wonder if the citizens in my country and town could make a better environment by throwing garbage away in the correct place and trying using eco - friendly transportation .
And government , please do n't be so flabby with your own citizen .
Yes , be strict .
I think it 's okay because the purpose of you doing that is to train the citizens to be more responsible for what they do . And I think that 's enough from me .
I suppose the government have also studied this situation .
But they did n't do that much after finding out this truth .
I hope the Indonesian government take action regarding this situation because , if it continues , then Indonesia will be the most unclean country over the other countries .
She looked happy and she was looking forward to finishing the class to tell her friends what had happened .
After the class , Alison joined her friends .
She was very enthusiastic and telling them that Juan , the boy who she had fallen in love with , had written a letter to her .
Then the friends could not fail to pay attention to Alison 's words .
She read the letter with a lot of passion , because it was obvious that Juan was interested in Alison too .
While all the girls were listening to Alison , Juan appeared as a gosh .
Alison went red as a beetroot and all her friends laughed at her .
The boy felt very embarrassed , so he carried on on his way and he did not say anything to her .
Alison always thought : " If I had not told this story to my friends I would have spent all evening with Juan "
I think that there is a future for public transport , because over time the gasoline prices and the cost of the repairs to vehicles increase .
Like with other things , prices increase , from food to clothes and home supplies , gas , water , electricity . Then people choose public transport in the future .
Swimming has always been my favourite sport .
I used to go to the swimming pool when I was at school to learn to swim and it became my favourite activity when I was really tired .
I was with my sister and my friends and I had a wonderful time .
Moreover , it is said to be healthy and improves problems with the back , so going swimming is really beneficial for me .
Recently , I found a gadget to listen to music while I am swimming and it is marvellous because I also love listening to music .
For beginners in this sport I would recommend that a trainer teaches swimming properly because it is very important to pay attention to the position of the arms .
Swimming is one of the best sports to do because it requires all parts of the body .
For this reason , it is a perfect activity to do sport and enjoy yourself .
For example , transport .
There are lots of kinds of transportation like buses , cars , subways , trains or taixs .
May Maybe they are comfortable , terrible , , dangerous or average .
If you are late , you can use the subway because it is faster , safer and cheeper .
Cars and buses become dangerous and cause problems in the street .
Why do we have a fridge in every single home ?
Every day people think about fresh food , fast food , sweet food and many different types of food . Why ?
Are you thinking that emotional eating is your bad habit ?
How many times do you go shopping for some snacks ?
What happened to us ?
I remember that my childhood was very quiet and happy around dinner at grandmother 's house .
Really , I tell you that I was , like , a little bit future girl who has dinner regularly with two portions : soup and meal deal .
So we can start from the beginning : first , was breakfast , which included some cereals with hot milk .
Second , was lunch at school with something like a sandwich and some fruit .
Later I was at home at dinner time and had some dessert .
Can you see how easy and regular a life I have got .
My " private menu " included fresh food like salad , fish , fruit and vegetables - many options and healthy food .
Now , I am a 28-year - old woman who does n't have time for normal dinner because I 'm very busy .
Today , I wake up at 07.00am and grab some kind of bread with jam , drink a coffee , but more often than not , just have time for half a mug and run to work .
During the day , I have lunch , which is from a can or order some junk food .
Later , I order take away from a Chinese buffet or a pizza .
When the weekend comes , I have a plan for a special dinner which is home made , but do n't have time again .
What happened to my healthy life which I wanted to have when I was a child ?
Why does everything look more difficult and harder than it was before ?
She went to the train station and got a ticket to London .
She stood there and read the note again . The address was near to Big Ben .
When the train came she smiled and got on and sat down .
She turned her head and saw him . " He was following me " , she thought . " Well , I should ask him what he is doing here " .
" What are you doing here " asked Alison . He looked at her but with a bad smile , and turn his head .
First of all , finishing high school is a rite of passage that indicates the beginning of a new chapter for students .
From this moment , they will have maturity and responsibility .
However , many of them are not ready for this .
When you are travelling around the world by yourself , you gain a lot of knowledge , culture , discoveries and , with all of this , you gain personal experience .
Sometimes , this can change a person , making her or him have a new perception of the world .
However , some students do n't have this opportunity to travel ; they start to work .
The job provides , like the trip , responsibility and experience .
It changes the person in a different way too .
The consequences are n't good as the reasons , for instance , they may have the career prejudicate , or they spend so many years travelling that they are too old to study at a university .
Besides that , they have different points of view on many subjects , that is why they may not like the fun and the conversation in the social life with other students .
They can not enjoy this chapter with young and fresh thoughts .
Finally , to make a decision to not go to a university when you finish high school is n't the easiest action to take .
It is a big decision , that brings great consequences and great experiences .
Whatever the choice is , it will leave a mark on their lives forever .
Be careful and choose well .
If in a city people use public transport more than their own private vehicle , then it will help to protect the environment and ease traffic as well .
But nowadays , automobile companies are more focused on the improvement of cars so that they can be more environmentally friendly and traffic friendly .
The future of public transport will be measured on the basis of the advancement of the private vehicle .
Sometimes people get offended because of the crowd and the inconvenience caused by some people while using public transport .
But the main concern will be technology .
Technology is becoming more advanced .
A car is being made that is so eco - friendly and user - friendly that it is more
Many people say that , at school , all students have to start a sport and do it regularly .
It is not a good idea because some students have to study all afternoon for other subjects and free time is very scant .
As an example , if a student needs to recuperate a subject or has to get a good mark , they ca n't go to do a sport because there is no time .
In contrast , doing a sport is very important because we can make new friends or we can start to take responsibility , but the most important thing is that we are always active so our body can get good results .
To sum up , doing sports is very important for teenagers , whose bodies are growing , and doing it regularly is a commitment that we should make . In my opinion , however , doing a mandatory sport is not educational because we must do a sport with enthusiasm , not bothered or out of obligation .
I 'm writing with regard to the watch Fossil FS4735 , which is similar to FS4812 but with different colours .
I saw it a couple of days ago and I was going to buy it , but it has disappeared from your
products list ( I suppose it has been sold out ) .
However , I wonder if you could tell me when it
will be available again ?
Thank you in advance for the information .
In my opinion , they are not my friends . If your parents were your friends , you would live in harmony with them .
They would consider you as an independent person .
Accordingly , you would take responsibility for what you did .
There are some reasons why they are not , as follows .
First of all , I make every effort to do my job better , but , they only consider that I waste my time doing the wrong thing .
Next , they do n't believe my skills are good .
I do everything , but nothing .
They always look at me like I 'm a kid who never grew up .
It is ridiculous that my parents do n't believe in my ability .
I am overwhelmed with grief , living with them .
I prefer being alone to living with them .
People often discuss if TV viewing is useful for education .
In my opinion , watching TV is actually helpful for learning new things .
There is one argument that says that the TV promotes us .
The main reason for this is that TV teaches us , because it is an important medium in our lives .
A good example of this is the large amount of informative news which we are allowed to get .
This clearly shows that TV is teaching .
To sum up , TV viewing is not just entertaining at all ; It is definitely also educating .
Some of them believe that it can only entertain us , while others believe that it can also educate .
I bet if somebody wants to have some fun , he or she can just choose the right Channel or movie , such as comedies , video gags or funny TV shows .
Meanwhile , if an individual wants to learn from TV ,
TV provides lots of cognitive programs , like cooking , taking care of pets , how to eat well .
For me , I do prefer reality shows that help people with how to deal with problems .
Football is the favourite sport in the world .
It was invented by a talented athlete in the UK in early 1900 . The sport became very famous from when the first World Cup was held in Uruguay until the present .
I have really enjoyed watching and playing football since I was a kid .
There are several reasons why people really enjoy soccer so much .
Nothing is permanent in this world . I 've heard these words from the mouths of my parents and now it is in my heart and helps me to deal with this kind of life .
Sometimes you 're happy and sometimes you are sad , nor you are success or you are failed , that is the cycle of the life we are taking .
Life is changing very fast as the days on the calendar are going by , the flow of life continuously revolving with the world every person has .
Nobody can tell how , when , where and what will happen in the next 50 years of our lives .
It depends on how you deal with what you have in the present to be prepared for the forthcoming changes in the future .
There are a lot of factors that could greatly affect what you will be in the next 50 years of your life .
But the most vital part for these changes is you .
Everybody has the right one for a change , but it should be for the better and not for the worse .
A complicated ways from before , advanced technologies make it easy and simple now , what else more could we expect ?
The digital age has been a big problem for the music industry because the new technologies and the internet have helped music piracy .
The people already do not buy a CD , they simply download it .
It is a shame that a person works for many months people want to enjoy his work without having to pay ; it is literally stealing .
It is like you designing a chair and people taking it without paying .
Singers have to adapt and be able to survive piracy . Now most of their income is from concerts and digital platforms like Spotify .
Today , many people , groups or social movements disagree with different and mainly aspects of our dominant culture . For example , marriage or the age for marriage , the role of women in the family , religions , education and new types of family and many values .
This perspective on life is inspired by counter - culture movements and some people call these people " alternative " , but they are more common each day and this creates an inclusive and diverse society .
The culture is changing in this way . Maybe it could be wonderful for human freedom .
Eating habits in my country have really changed in the last ten years .
it 's r is n't clear completely , but I suppose it depends on changing life habits in the development process of our society .
The first and most important change is related to eating prepared food that is n't healthy . Usually , the reason is probably women 's lifestyles , which are going through big changes in the sense that they do n't like staying at home and spending their time making food . Now they prefer to buy prepared food .
The other issue is related to our habit of eating food together with our family , which was a custom in human life , not just in our culture , but now because of a hard and busy life , we had to eat our meals most days of the week .
Now , we forget big dinner tables that are surrounded by family members .
But a good change in our habits is the attention to calories and healthy food , because of getting information on the internet and other media that are easily accessible for all people these days .
In summary , l think the change is negligible but we can control it to make our life better , especially in relation to food , which is the most important aspect of our life but we do n't pay attention to it enough .
The truth of the matter is I think I 'm full of ideas but , unfortunately , I ca n't describe my knowledge and experiences in English .
However , I can write these ideas in my own native language and that 's why I 'm thinking that one day I should be able to write those ideas in English as well .
That was the best place I have ever been .
We went to New York for four days .
While I was in the bathroom , my cousin was smoking .
When I went back , a policeman asked him not to smoke , so he was angry for the whole flight .
On Friday , we went on an incredible sightseeing tour , but the guide told me not to take pictures because I had to buy them .
It was a well planned holiday .
Michael , together with his two friends , Adam and John , decided to take a vacation in Pulau Langkawi , Kedah , Malaysia .
They searched for flight tickets , rental car , and hotel .
They were very excited and could n't wait to go there .
About one month before departure , they researched on the internet the places that might interest them .
There were Padang Matsirat , Cable Car , Mahsuri Tomb , small islands , Duck tour , beaches , shopping centre and , the most exciting thing was buying chocolates .
One day before going , Michael suddenly had a problem .
He needed to follow his family to the town .
Adam and John were very angry .
They said they had already planned everything and Michael had happily ruined the vacation .
They needed to think again about the budget and all of the other stuff .
Michael could n't stand anymore . He scolded his friends and said something that no one would want to hear .
She tried to have a calm talk with her son in his room .
She said money can cause everyone pain if it is not settled very well .
After all the wise advice , his mother kissed him on his forehead .
Michael tried to think wisely again .
He accompanied his mother to his room 's door .
He called his friends back and managed to sort out the mess .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he had forgotten what he had to do . After thinking , he remembered that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her in his car as the doctor 's clinic was far away from her house . Peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother 's house in the next street . After he arrived , he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the street . He apologized to her and asked her to get into the car . " Never mind " she said and got in the car beside him .
Peter drove his car to the doctor 's clinic and after half an hour he arrived and he and his grandmother went up the stairs to reach the doctor 's clinic . After they arrived , they found that they had to wait a period of time to take their turn . They waited and then their turn came . They entered the doctor 's surgery and the doctor was very kind . He welcomed them and after checking Peter 's grandmother , said
she was absolutely fine .
There is a man who is the most important in everyone 's life .
I am not different in that . There is a backstairs influence in my life . He is none other than my father .
I respect him so much and admire him also .
He always helps me by giving good advice .
He is an ideal farmer who never ever tells a lie .
His means of making a livelihood is the simplest .
He always honors the oldest and taught us to avoid telling a lie . As far as I remember , one day he was advising me when suddenly an old man entered the conversation and gave a foolish speech .
Nevertheless , my father did n't tell him arrogantly but he made him know the right thing politely .
He is a fluent speaker .
That 's why I admire him .
Everyone makes mistakes . No one can say I have not made any mistakes in my life .
I have made many mistakes I guess .
But is that a big problem in our lives or a small problem , or does it really not matter ?
Or do you really regret what you have done ?
Travelling by car plays an important role in our lives .
There is a lot of private transport in the streets .
However , travelling by bus or tram never get away from our daily routine . Travelling by bus is not as convenient as getting in a car , but you can never know what might happen with your car , where it might get stuck in traffic or some other accident might happen .
This fact gives the government the opportunity to manage the traffic on the roads in cities or towns .
Private transport gives us traffic jams , a lot of accidents and stressful situations .
We get nervous because we are responsible not only for our lives but for other people 's , too .
And , also , we have to understand that using public transport is cheaper than using a car .
The other side of the problem is ecological .
What can we say about our ecological awareness ?
Let 's take a bicycle to travel to our school or job instead of using any public or private transport .
Transport is very important for our lives .
Public transport will have no future because travelling by car is more convenient .
Public transport is not suitable for luggage .
Travel plans need to depend on public transport timetables .
It is more fun when we travel by car .
We can play music or talk about anything while we travel in a car .
If there is no public transport in some areas , then we need to hire a taxi .
So , If we have our own car , it is much easier than using public transport .
Hong Kong is a wonderful place for shopping , eating and sight - seeing .
Visit Big Budda on Lamma Island , see the beautiful night view on the Peak .
Besides , Hong Kong also has many country parks for hiking .
If you want to find a job for only three months , I suggest you could teach English for a summer school .
In Hong Kong , most students would like to take some courses in the summer holidays .
I will get some information for you if you are interested in that .
Write to me when you have fixed your itinerary , and looking forward to seeing you in Hong Kong .
I think public transport is paramount nowadays , but the future will bring us some kind of different means of transport , such as the car . Yes , the car we have been using all our lives .
But this time , it will be another story , because in order to save time and money , we are going to use our own cars .
Let me explain my reasons . When you drive your car , you can take it from your garage or outside the main door of your house and it gets you to wherever you want . But on the other hand , if you take public transport , it will be much more inconvenient because you have to catch the bus at a bus stop ... Where is your nearest bus stop ?
Then you have to take the subway to your destination , so that means a waste of time . On the other hand , it is cheaper , but what happens if you do n't have any coins to pay the bus driver ? Here comes the problem .
You have to look for a shop to turn your money into coins .
Obviously , you are late for work , even if you have an appointment to have an interview for a job .
She read a note from her boyfriend , Tom .
They are going to see a new film about James Bond .
Alison is very happy because she had not seen Tom for two months .
He had to study in a different country and they had not seen each other for months .
Tom is studying in London .
Alison goes to a bus stop and she waits for a bus .
When she arrives at a shopping centre , Tom is already waiting .
The Lion King is my favourite film .
It is a story about a little lion and his life .
He lives in the wild .
His father saves him from a fight but he dies and Symba is sad .
He moves to another place because he does n't want to be in the same place where his father died .
But he gets to know Timon and Pumba and they make Symba believe again that life is good .
Then , Symba saves Pumba from a lion and this lion is Nala , who is an old friend of Symba .
My name is Shousheng and I live in Montreal , Canada .
Although Canada is an English - speaking country , in Montreal , the official language is French .
So I do not have the opportunity to practise English , because most of my colleagues speak French .
They speak French in meetings , in the gearm , and in the shopping . centres
When I have free time , I usually run , because I feel really relaxed after that .
In fact , I know it 's very difficult to do it if you give it up .
I was inspired by a true legend . His name is Edan Hazard .
My favourite teams are Chelsea , Man City , Man United , Real Madrid and Barcelona .
That is all I can say . I love football very much .
Yes , we can say that the car is much more convenient . But not every person can afford a car .
That 's the first fact ,
and the second one is the fashion or style of young people who do n't like going somewhere using a car rather than a bike .
after that last point We can not go everywhere we would like using a car .
There are also limitations there .
Maybe so many people like it because there are so many services with it .
But that does not mean that public transport does not have a future .
That fact behind sense because the maintenance of public transport is not the responsibility of the traveler .
If we want to count function of public transport because it 's not enough words to say . But public transport is a much needed service in big cities as well as small villages .
It 's not so hard to find sights to see in such a big city as Moscow , but when you have a wide variety of museums , parks , clubs , you will try to visit only the best ones .
I 'm sure you 'll agree that Red Square is the most popular sight in the capital of Russia .
From Red Square , you can easily see the Moscow Kremlin , St. Basil 's Cathedral , the State Historical Museum and Gum Department Store .
If you are dying of hunger , you can have a quick snack at Teremok cafe or have a square meal at restaurant # 57 , which is on the third floor of Gum .
Gorky Park is my favorite place for my leisure time .
It 's the capital 's central park where you 'll find lots of interesting things .
There are lots of facilities , such as sports centre , a ping pong club , a hire centre etc .
There is an open - air cinema , but it opens only after 10.00 pm .
He likes playing with his mobile phone , playing basketball and reading books .
His hobbies are listening to music , playing computer games , watching football matches and watching TV .
These are my friend 's hobbies .
I 'm only fifteen years old , but I think I have a heavy past .
We did n't have a lot of money , but I went to a private elementary school .
I had a lot of friends ; too many friends .
In sixth grade , I realized that they did n't really love me , or even like me .
I remember two contrasting moments . One day , we had to create a team to do an exercise which used the brain ; they chose me .
However , another time , we had to create a team for doing sport , and they did n't choose me .
That get to the second problem I had , and still have now : my weight .
I was too fat , too much fat .. I looked at my health booklet one month ago , and I saw that I have been overweight since I was four years old .
Until sixth grade , I thought I was " normal " , but then everything changed .
Learning English is very important to the future of everyone .
It is a language that many people speak and know .
Later , people continue in language schools .
It is a difficult language , so , the best option is to go abroad .
In an English - speaking country , every day you learn to live .
People speak differently , but with a basic level , they understand English .
It is difficult to go to an unknown place with different people , but it is a good experience to learn .
I think if the whole world had only one language it would be better .
Everyone could speak and understand each other .
But this is not so . Therefore , we must study English .
Because of her suggestions , I learned how to control my temper while I was dealing with failures and kept telling myself that it was n't a big shame because I had tried my best .
I like walking in the morning every day and I enjoy doing it on my own or with my friends , because it 's very good for my health and also it keeps my body healthy and full of energy .
Sometimes , I feel tired of walking , especially on sunny days with high temperatures , but that ca n't make me stop doing this sport .
When I 'm walking , it can refresh me all the time and makes me feel good .
I want to give advice to people who love this type of sport : please do not give it up , and do it as often as you can , because it 's a beneficial sport .
It 's a good idea to improve my English writing .
I 'd like to speak about the education system in Egypt .
I graduated from the faculty of law " English division " two years ago with a very good grade .
The ordinary result of the big effort I had made at my university to have a good job in my specialization , as a lawyer .
But in Egypt no one gets what he deserves . You have to pay a lot of money to have a job or know someone who can use his authority to appoint you .
So , I wanted to get a job in another state , like Dubai . I heard jobs there are very good and the salaries . I have submitted my CV for various jobs ,
Your qualifications are not satisfactory . You must be UK Or USA educated .
Finally , I see that I have very high marks for my education , but do I not have the ability to work in real life because in Egypt there is the worst education .
3 ) Meryy refused to borrow money .
5 ) I look forward to meeting you .
I do not think it 's easy to do research in India .
Even if I want to focus on my work , they create one or the other issue to distract me .
But it will be very romantic to be with my girlfriend and fight the system .
We can change everything that harms us if we need to , if we have the will .
The reasons for stress are more diverse ; perhaps because we have an exam period , family problems or because we think in a negative way , or we have destroyed ourselves through long hours of working and canceld our needs for enough comfort , and lots of reasons to stress ...
We must get rid of the stress quickly before we lose ourselves , because it 's very harmful . For example , you can read a book , do sport , play music , eat delicious food , remember all the positive things that have happened to you , talk with someone who you trust , get rid of everything that makes you upset and makes your life tiring , go out and eat a meal with your best friends , and there are a lot of things you can do ...
Remember that stress is not a lasting thing , and you can avoid it .
But if you are willing to live a happy life .
I am writing to complain about the cafe 's lunch menu .
In my opinion , the main course needs improvement .
Secondly , there is not a lot of variety in the desserts , mainly fruits and puddings .
There are not many healthy drinks . There are not many hot drinks either .
Some people in my college are vegetarian , Muslim , vegan etc . and they do not have a lot of varieties of food to choose , from like halal meat and veg and nothing that comes from animals .
It is thought that you should change the type of food regularly .
You should also reduce fast food , which makes people obese and is not healthy .
It would be better if you offered drinks according to the weather , so , when it 's winter , we would like a hot drink and , if it is summer , we would like a chilled drink .
I 'm writing to you regarding an advertisement I saw on my way home calling for candidates to fill a vacancy on your cafe staff .
For that reason , this job is perfectly suitable for me and , besides , it showed up as a good opportunity for me to improve my income , helping me to pay my bills .
I am twenty - five years old and when I was teenager I lived abroad twice .
The first time was in London for 6 months , and most recently , in Berlin for 8 months .
The movie I 'm going to be reviewing is " The Purge "
I actually liked it quite a lot . I just loved all the suspense and the parts where they leave you hanging . It 's just really interesting . The movie is about the American government , who annually give 12 hours when all crimes , even murder , are legal , and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call " the purge " and anyone can join in . You can kill whoever you want .
The thing is , some people do n't think it 's OK , and they do n't agree , so they just stay inside and try to survive the night .
The diagrams illustrate the process of producing bank notes .
At the beginning , bank notes should be well - designed , considering the colour matching and artwork , including issues relating to security .
After designing them , metal plates are prepared with the help of experienced machinists .
Then it comes to the printing step .
Ensuring there is colour on both sides , the image is raised gently by a special type of ink .
Most importantly , before distribution , printed sheets with 50 bank notes per sheet have to be checked to see whether they are of perfect quality or not .
They can only be packed and distributed if they are of good quality .
In other words , both bad sheets and the ones which are separated badly need destroying in a safe way which can stop them from getting into the market .
That 's how bank notes are produced from paper to what we can use to purchase goods in our daily life .
Many people believe that nowadays there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient , but others continue with the thought that they do help , for example , with travelling long distances .
Firstly , there are plenty of people who ca n't buy a car , and so , the only option they have is to travel by these modes of transport .
The ticket does n't cost too much and it is affordable for the majority of people , at least compared to buying a car .
Secondly , public transport is more efficient for travelling long distance than cars and people would n't have to purchase fuel .
When people need to travel to other continents or far away , they may need a plane , which is a form of public transport , to complete the journey because they have to cross oceans and complicated distances that have different landforms .
However , a car is something which belongs to the person and he can do whatever he wants and find it in the same state he left it in , and sometimes public transport vehicles are n't left in the best way .
In addition , you have to share with people you absolutely do n't know and probably wo n't see again .
Consequently , you can be robbed or get sick .
But , by observing all these people , you can enrich yourself with the different cultures and manners the others have and incorporate new topics .
To conclude , we can establish a middle point .
Public transport is useful but sometimes inconvenient and cheaper . You can get to know new people and different cultures .
When I was 12 , I went to France for the first time in my life .
That was my first time on holiday in another country that was n't northern Italy .
I remember I woke up at 6 o'clock to take the train and went to Paris in France .
After 4 hours sitting on an uncomfortable seat , we arrived at the train station and then my parents and I went to the hotel .
We visited a lot of monuments , museums and churches , like the Louvre with the Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci .
That week I felt happy and relaxed , but I was a little bit sad when we returned to Italy .
I am only waiting to go there another time !
Nowadays , many people have their own transport . For example , they have cars .
Transport is the best facility for people to be able to travel around a country .
Without transport , people can not go to work or do anything else .
Public transport is the best way to go to work . Because it is easy to travel .
No need to pay the full amount , because they have many people who board the bus .
Public transport helps us to know our country and enables our body to move from one place to another .
For example , we have to walk to go to a place , whereas a car can park in the place where we want to go .
It helps us in many different ways . If we have a problem , we can take a bus and go there .
All villages have a bus stop where the bus stops to pick up or drop off passengers .
And some buses drive at night to transport passengers .
Without it , many people would have a lot of difficulty going somewhere or returning home .
However , there are some disadvantages with public transport . They cause many traffic jams . This is because the buses are large and difficult to control .
If the roads are narrow , the bus wo n't go along the street .
The bus will not drop off the passengers where they want to go , because they have to drop them off at the bus stop .
Day by day , the country is developing more and more . Nowadays , we have trains .
Many people travel by train because they arrive quicker than the bus and are cheaper in the long run .
Public transport will have a future because some people have no money to buy their own car .
Public transport helps us in many different ways .
It will better if we have public transport .
Dear Kuba
Is your family happy that you came back ?
I am writing to tell you that I met my aunt Lisa when I was in London last month .
We met each other near Oxford Street , when I was going to a supermarket .
She is a very interesting and wise person , but the best thing is her humor .
We are going to travel to France this holiday .
Kisses
Nowadays , using public transport is considered to be the most convenient
way to get around .
It provides citizens with the freedom to relax and disconnect while going home or to work .
However , taking your own car is much more useful .
And for this reason , I honestly think it will be the only means of transport in the future .
For me , the most interesting one is sightseeing around the city and discovering its monuments and landmarks .
However , there is also an endless of leisure activities , such as going shopping or going to museums , to cinemas or to beautiful parks .
If that is not enough , you will be able to enjoy the amazing atmosphere of our nightlife , going to restaurants , to clubs or lounge bars .
In my town people are very educated and very aware of the environment , they know very well that if we take care of the environment then it will be useful for us only , so they are always careful about rubbish and try to clean the village .
Whenever they go outside , they always keep a plastic bag with them so whatever rubbish they will not throw on the road or outside .
They always keep the rubbish and dust in a plastic bag and then they throw it in the dustbin .
D. Perhaps bilingual school creation might be a good idea for Colombian education improvement , but it would be appropriate to be aware that Colombia actually has public schools with a basic education where English is considered as another academic subject , in contrast with the private ones .
Because the majority of schools do n't have enough resources to pay for it .
The whole picture shows us the process of making bank notes .
It depends on five main steps , which include design , preparation of metal plates , printing , inspection , packaging and destruction or disposal depending on whether the fourth step is good or bad .
Above all , the design is the most important step we should know , which involves considering the background color and artwork .
Secondly , we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinists .
And then we need printing and inspection .
Eventually , the most essential part comes . We need to inspect the quality of the sheets .
If it 's good , they go to packing and distribution , whereas the others should be destroyed as well .
In conclusion , the whole process is an unreversed schedule .
It cosumemed the power which includes humans and machines .
Nevertheless , in my opinion , the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti - developed society .
To begin with is design , we have to consider background colour , artwork , and security issues , and then we are supposed to prepare metal plates , using skilled machinists .
Secondly , printing -- including sheets of bank notes , are printed ( 50 bank notes per sheet ) . There are some requirements -- colour on both sides , special ink , slightly raised images .
The most important step is inspection . The printed sheets should be manually inspected .
If partially damaged sheets exist , the bank notes should be separated into good and bad .
Finally , if it is a good sheet , the procedure is packaging and distribution , including cutting into separate bank notes , packing , dispatching .
If it is a bad sheet , the procedure is disposal -- bad sheets and bank notes should be securely destroyed .
I do not know from where to start .
Back in the 40 's , Cairo was considered as one of the cleanest and most environmentally friendly city in the world , Even cleaner than Paris or other cities in Europe .
But time changes and things change with it .
Nowadays , Cairo can be considered as one of the - if not the most - dirtiest cities in the world .
Rubbish is everywhere , people finish their food and throw empty bags in the streets instead of keeping it until they find a bin .
So , the ugly truth is , my country is n't clean and people do nothing towards rectifying this .
In the right - hand corner , there 's a sign which says that in this shop it 's not to allowed to sell knives .
It is a fact that , on the one hand , you have the opportunity to buy dangerous weapons nowadays , but on the other hand , we are unable to manage this situation correctly .
It is true that there is an increase in violence compared with the past and it is our duty to tell our children that a world without guns is a better world .
Max and his family had been on their holidays for two weeks now . This year they had decided to do a safari as a new experience .
Unfortunately , Max was not as excited as his family ; he had never really been into animals .
He only enjoyed staying at the hotel watching television .
Once he had woken up , he went walking outside the hotel for the first time .
Today , for some reason , he had this feeling that something interesting was going to happend .
He walked and walked , thinking about what could it be , until , after a long time walking , he realised he did not know where he was .
Suddenly , he heard something . Was it an animal ? , he thought .
And then he realised it was an enormous lion .
Max froze . He did not know what to do .
The lion was getting closer and when he reached Max he lay on the floor and looked at the boy .
Max , for some reason , stroked him and the lion smiled .
But suddenly he heard a noise , it was his mum . " Max where are you ? " she screamed . The lion disappeared in one second , running .
So Max walked up to her , and said " Here mom , do n't worry . Let 's go into the hotel . "
Max spent the rest of the day thinking about that lion until he went into his room . " What an amazing day ! " ,
Dear teacher ,
I am studying at Yung Feng high school .
Not long ago , I won first prize in math competitions at school .
The presidential election will begin in Taiwan next year .
I look forward to the result being released .
All the time , we are learning more for our various goals .
My goal is admission to National University .
Continue studying
Everyone in the world has a goal .
My ultimate aim is to continue my studies .
Unfortunately , my previous studies were in Arabic .
This prevents me from achieving my goal .
The most difficult area in English I have trouble with is writing .
I have no problems with reading , speaking or listening .
As part of my plan to improve my English skills , I decided to search on the internet for any free program which could help me with the plan to improve my English writing .
I found your website and this is my first try .
For example , new computers are smaller in size than the old computers , they are also faster and more efficient , they have better resolution and a bigger memory to save files and other stuff like apps .
Trieste is a little town situated in the north - east of Italy .
For example , in our school there is the possibility to collect paper and plastic in different boxes .
In the last year , some politicians have decided to put our city in order . So , for example , they put again to place the roads .
In the middle of the main street , which is next to the sea , there is a divider with a lot of flowers and plants .
So the environmental impact is very attractive .
We still have many problems to solve in our city .
There are n't boxes for rubbish in every condominium , and we do n't have the harvest of the dampness that is present in many other towns in Italy .
Another problem is that the citizens of Trieste do n't pay attention to the environmental problems of their city .
For example , when a man or a woman has finished smoking , he / she throws the earth cigarette instead of in the right box .
In other countries it would be impossible , because if someone wanted to do this , he 'd have a fine to pay .
I think it is important that , not only in the family , but also in school , we could raise a new generation sensitive to the ecological problems of the earth .
In this way , we would have the possibility to change .
Today a lot of people do sports , but not all sports are amused .
It 's great for me to write about sports and health .
When I was a child , I used to play football with my friends .
I sometimes played in school break in the morning .
This sport was very happier for me , but one day I broke my leg and then I never played football again .
I had to go jogging a few years ago .
I often finished up very tired because I never did sport .
Because on occasions it 's very boring .
Although I go jogging , I also do another sport , swimming .
I began doing this sport three years ago when I lost my job .
I usually go two days a week but next month I am going to go three or four days a week because I hope to enter a local competition .
I go swimming at a public pool .
On the one hand , this sport is good for my health . I keep fit .
On the other hand , I have met a lot of people , and they are very friendly .
And finally , I will only tell you that you should do some sport . It is good for us .
At this moment he woke up .
He noticed that he was trembling " it was just a dream " - he thought .
His uncle 's birthday was hounding him because he did n't know what he should buy for him .
He had already asked all the family about this , nobody had n't idea what would be good enough .
Then he decided that he would just go to the fishing shop and ask a shop assistant for help .
It was a great idea !
The man was professional and gave him useful pieces of advice .
He bought the best of all presents .
Uncle Tom was delighted and proud of him .
Off the top of his head , he asked his nephew to go fishing with him .
Jerry said that he would be honoured .
It turned out that that young boy had a good head for fishing and now they always go fishing together .
I do a lot of sports , and now I 'm going to tell all about them .
I like running , riding my bike , playing football , skiing in winter , climbing , etc .
What I like about running is going to the mountains and enjoying the landscape .
What I like about cycling is doing routes and very long paths .
I like football because it is a sport that I have played since I was small and I think that it is the most fun and exciting team sport .
I like skiing because it is a sport that I also did when I was small . I like high speeds and lower living at high altitudes and enjoying great landscapes .
I like climbing , but it is a sport that I have just started ... but I want to keep practising it and keep learning new things .
The amount of garbage is increasing at the same time as the number of humans is increasing .
The growth of consumption in developing countries leads to increasing consumption of energy , water and other resources .
Pollution of the ecosystems is increasing in these countries too , as a result .
These problems are topical in our city , Kyiv , too .
Nowadays , our local government is making some decisions to improve the situation .
It is going to build several modern combustion plants , and some programmes for discrete rubbish collection are being implemented .
There are a lot of citizens movement except official activities .
People organise common action for cleaning areas near houses .
Some activists plant trees in spring .
These activities take place especially in spring and in autumn .
I hope that most of the big businesses , plants and stations will be taken outside of the city boundaries .
These days , transportation has become so crowded . We have a lot of cars in the streets .
There are a lot of accidents because many people drive so fast .
We should put a lot of cameras in the street to know how these accidents are caused .
if everybody knew that there is a punishment for what they do and nobody can escape from what he did , I guess we would have fewer traffic accidents .
Everyone is curious about making bank notes .
The bank notes are designed carefully . Workers need to design their background colour and artwork .
What 's more , the notes will also be printed with security features .
Then , the notes will be prepared on metal plates . After that , printing . The notes will be printed in colour on both sides with special ink and they will have slightly raised images .
Good ones will be packaged and distributed . workers will cut them and deal with them carefully .
The rest of them will be disposed of .
I think that C√°diz is the perfect place to meet , because C√°diz has coast , sea , and mountains .
The people are very kind and funny , and it is a very cheap city .
In C√°diz , in summer , there are a lot of opportunities to work .
C√°diz is a beautiful city and you would enjoy it a lot if you worked here .
Also , you are a great athlete , so you could teach surfing , football or other sports .
On the other hand , in C√°diz there are a lot of bars , so you could find a job as a waiter .
Since I was seven years old I have been on my city 's basketball team , and I have no doubt that playing basketball is one of the things that I enjoy the most in my life .
I like basketball because , besides the benefit that it brings to your health and physical well - being , it is also a really good hobby .
You also get to meet a lot of people at tournaments or even at normal games .
I am writing this letter to complain about the CPU that I bought last week .
I ordered 2 NVIDIA GTX 1080 , but I still do n't have my order in my hand .
I need the CPU as soon as possible and before 17 March 2017 .
If by 17 March my order has not come yet , I will cancel my order and I want a 100% refund of my money .
I think you should be more on time or you will get a bad rating from your customers .
Thanks for everything and I want my money back if I do not get my cpu .
I hope I will get my order and I hope you will be more on time for the customer order shipping .
yours sincerely
Nowadays , people are becoming more independent , and more than this problem , society now needs to show others this independence and control of their own lives , which includes cars , houses and materials .
On the one hand , travelling by car can be an excellent way to get to where you want to go , without going on foot to find your bus stop and becomes less important if you live in the centre of your town or in the suburbs .
Another advantage of travelling by car is that you do n't have to spend time waiting for your other transport , and you can avoid the crowds of people that are in the subway stations every morning to get in the line if you want to arrive at work on time .
On the other hand , public transport is the only resource some people have to get around , and more than excellent for the environment , it 's also a good way to avoid traffic and spending money on petrol , since it 's cheaper if you catch a bus .
Another disadvantage is that using the car can be problematic in some situations , like if you go to a football game by car , you probably wo n't have a place to park it .
In conclusion , cars wo n't let public transport be forgotten , since as well as providing the only way some people have to travel , cars are n't so convenient for some situations .
I think you should go to a large school in a town because there you can have more friends and you can do a lot of other things that you can not do in the countryside .
I really want to go to a big school in a town , because here in the countryside , I can not go out with my friends or go shopping with them .
In a town you can do everything fun .
You can go to the shopping mall , to the halfpipes , to the skate parks and you can do a lot of other cool things with your friends , but in the countryside you ca n't .
But you should go to the school that you want . That is just my advice , OK ?
I really want you to be happy with your new life .
I think that family and friends are the most important people in our lives because if you have some problems they are always there and they try to help you .
These people can influence our lives . For example , if you have bad friends you become a bad person and you will have problems in your life . So , your education depends on the people around you .
It is not important if these people are friends or family , they can change our lives for better or worse , it depends on you to choose the best thing that can help you .
As we know , nowadays , everything is possible .
In general , people have the possibility to study in libraries or using computers .
Studying in libraries requires a lot of quiet and patience .
There you must n't speak loudly and you always have to wait for your turn to borrow something or you have to wait if another student has the book you need .
Personally , I think studying on a computer is a better choice .
I 'm not saying that just because of the easy way that you can study what you want .
In this way , you can , maybe , read aloud .
If I were a student that usually studies in a library , I would definitely try studying on a computer .
In this way , I would n't waste a lot of time .
If somebody says that there is no future for public transport , I mind immediately . Today there are too many vehicles on our streets .
The roads are chock a block . Everybody has a private car .
People are thinking about a comfortable life instead of the environment and saving money .
Mainly , the environment will change .
Also , every year , there are more companies that produce different types of pollution on our planet .
Because of this , I think that the climate will change in 20 years .
Therefore , the animals will not survive in this climate .
Also , the humans wo n't be able to go into the street all day , only for a few hours , because of the hot climate .
Living there will be harmful for everybody !
We need to do something to save the world !
The members of my family are certainly my real best friends , who I can trust and ask anything without shame or regrets .
I think they are our first friends and our first confidants .
Every day they prove they are the people who care about me .
Think about a family 's routine .
Every morning they take breakfast together , speaking about things that are not too important .
They listen to you , discuss your problems .
Sorry for taking so long to get back to you , it 's the end of the quarter and you know how crazy this period is for a salesman .
I would like to understand the benefits of an MBA at IMD and how it would help me in my career .
Talking about the World Cup a little .
Watching our national team 's games , I came to the conclusion that we have no need to check our heart condition .
The Brazil and Netherlands games were a real test of our health .
According to the reality , a lot of young people are n't very communicated in their life .
For example , in your childhood you are much happier than your parents because their job is not very easy .
They have to look after their children and it 's very stressful , I think .
Firstly , young people usually calm down through music , for example classical music .
But most young people are not interested in this type of music .
For instance , they prefer pop or rock music .
Through listening to music , you can express your emotions and this is the most beautiful thing .
Secondly , they like watching series on TV .
That makes them happy and additionally makes loud .
Usually , they watch crime series because it 's very interesting and really mysterious .
A lot of young men love wearing jeans and a T - shirt .
But girls love wearing skirts and snug shirt .
I think style is very important in our lives .
Through style , we can express our emotions and feelings .
In conclusion , the life of young people is not very easy .
Hi , my name is Adrian . I am 17 years old and I am a footballer . I was born to be a footballer .
We played football every day in school and I was the best .
I was even better than the older children . Everyone told me to go to a team ,
but I did n't have to do anything . A team took on me when I was 11 years old .
I was in this team for 5 years and that made me even better at football .
I played my first match at 16 years old and I felt very special because I was 16 and I was capable of scoring 3 goals .
I played so well that everyone congratulated me . But that 's not all . One of the best teams in the world wanted to take me on .
I was very happy and , of course , I agreed .
I definitely agree with that .
Already , in only 20 years , a lot of things have changed because of the technology .
And I think that it 's not technology that will change , but the people and their characters .
Unfortunately , for this generation , there wo n't be real relationships , all relationships will become virtual relationships .
The good news is the people who can take advantage of technology can save a lot of time because they might have a sophisticated robot that can help at home .
According to my experience , if we do n't exaggerate the way we use technology like the internet , phone , satellite .
It will be a good thing that we can spend our time on a good thing .
In some people 's lives , the most important thing is to wear fashionable clothes .
On the one hand , I think it is important to look good , but sometimes the latest fashion is not the best choice to feel happy and comfortable .
For example , now high - heeled shoes are very trendy but they cost a lot and most women do n't look good in them .
On the other hand , the personality is more important and determinative than an expensive dress . It is a fact .
But if somebody wants to follow the latest fashion , I accept it , because she just feels good in those clothes .
In conclusion , my opinion is that the personality is more important than the clothes we wear , but everybody has her own life and the choice to decide what she wants .
Transportation is one of the most essential parts of our day to day life ; whether it is public or private , transport takes the same priority in each person 's life from the very early days .
Basically , we have land , water and air transport for reliable purpose .
In the age before industrialisation came into existence , people also used various alternatives to travel from one place to another .
They mostly depended on animals to pull carts and to ride on them .
Then the technology improved gradually towards mechanical engines to make the transport more convenient .
The developed version of all those engines is used in running vehicles on land , water and air which make our lives faster .
But in this modern era of globalisation , global warming is one of the prime concerns of the earth .
And when we look at the modern technologies of transportation , it seems there is no future for public transport .
It is inevitably true that excessive use of public transport leads to higher levels of pollution .
So , it would be better to go for any other alternative of green technology for future use to make this world a better place .
Yesterday , I had a wonderful day . In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training session with a Spanish selection coach . When I finished I went with my parents to a hotel to eat and spend time with some friends . After the food . we met up with friends of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode on a roller coaster , it was very exciting , and we ate a chocolate ice cream . It was delicious . In the evening , we went to a Spanish basketball league game , Obradoiro versus Real Madrid , and that match beat the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep .
When I find myself in London , I 'll go to Buckingham Palace , which is located in the City of Westminster and I 'll visit your art gallery and tourist attractions of the British monarchy .
Continuing my visit to London , I will visit the largest park in London , Hyde Park , which has a full day of guided outdoor games and activities for the preservation of the park .
follow in London I 'll go for a walk to get to Big Ben , which is the most beautiful building in all its splendour , where I will take pictures .
Later , I 'll take the London Underground , which is a public fast transit system . I 'll travel on it .
When I leave the underground at Wembley Park station , I will go to Wembley Stadium , where I will enjoy an evening of football . The match starts at 8:00pm .
My favorite band is " cbjr " ; it 's a Brazilian band . The type of music is rock and rap . Their music is very easy to single .
I really like , in the moments when I am listening , to turn up the radio , but the singles are dead .
In another words , this kind of education system should be included in all classes in all schools .
However , I strongly believe that the measurement of education level does not explicitly interest with sex differences in classes , but it is also related to the quality of education in schools .
Education plays a crucial role in society and its future and by improving the standard of the education system , students can learn more effectively throughout their entire educational life and their career , but also their skills will be improved by this process .
Nowadays , unfortunately , students can not get enough education from their schools whereas in some poor countries .
Their systems are no longer good enough and students will not make a good career for their future .
On the other hand , by building a more effective learning system which will be provided by local authorities , students will be encouraged to learn more efficiently .
Lack of teaching methods , poor audience of the class , insufficient quantity of learning materials , for instance , all of these matters should be enhanced until good quality has been set up in the system .
Besides , by employing these kinds of procedures , students will also gain more respect towards their studies and their jobs .
Hopefully , they will not only earn more money in their entire life , but also , society will have a more developed shape in any other developed countries .
It is true that coeducation can motivate students while they work with other sex students , we ought to also bear in mind , this is not the only solution to get the best result .
Therefore , we should consider other kinds of problems which affect the education system .
In a nutshell , based on the above - mentioned points , such as the quality of the education system not only interests with mixed education but also it will need some good solutions in some subjects that were mentioned .
It is concluded that these kinds of developments will be put into action for all schools shortly .
Because of that , it is a pleasure to speak about them !
I will start by introducing my favorite family members .
My sister is two years older than me .
She has been an important person to me since I was 8 .
Our parents separated in 1980 , when I was 8 and she was 10 .
Since that time , we have been very close until now .
We have a good relationship , she is my best friend .
My father is another important person to me .
I appreciate him a lot , because he stayed with me and my sister and his life changed completely .
He invested in our education and today he has a lot of admiration for our lives and our decisions .
When I became , first a teenager and later an adult , I got to know the majority of my friends , good friends .
We keep in regular contact , we go out to dinner or have a coffee frequently .
Both are very important to my emotional stability .
How are you ? Hope everything 's fine .
Everything here is great .
It 's been so long since we last talked ... and I have some great news !
Well , I 'm writing to tell you that this summer I 'm coming to the UK , and I 'd like to hang out with you for some time !
It 'll be the second time I 've visited the UK , and I do n't want to do the same excursions , so would you mind telling me some good activities to do or some places to visit there ?
Also , I 'd like to invite you to my house here in Spain . All my friends and I are having a party and it would be fantastic if you were able to come .
Our world is very polluted by public transport so we think about what will happen in the future . Public transport causes many problems in our environment , such as difficulty getting to the nearest destination , pollution , and disease .
We must think of alternative solutions to this problem .
We face difficulty reaching our own destination .
Many people get to their work late .
Using public transport makes us arrive late because it stops many times .
With our private car , we can do many tasks in our day , but using buses we waste our time and have to make more efforts .
Buses run on petrol that causes pollution .
Nowadays , there are some vehicles that run on electricity . We can decrease pollution by using electricity .
Hence , this will help people to be in a good health .
In addition , crowded buses cause infections among people .
private cars reduce infections .
Crowded buses spread epidemics in our society .
Finally , we hope for a healthy future for our future generations . We want to reach our destination on time and live a safe life without diseases and pollution .
My favourite sport is volleyball . I have been playing it since 2006 . My favourite position is number 2 . I usually play it in the faculty of engineering ? . It makes me fit and tall .
I like it very much .
I usually play it with my friends .
when I joined the Egyptian armed forces , I played for the air defense forces team .
We won 1st place and got the cup . If anyone intends to play this game , he should practise hard to be able to play it professionally .
Further to the trade fair last week , where I had the pleasure of meeting you and we were talking about your courses ,
Could you put in me contact with any of your customers for more information ?
I am looking forward your to reply .
When I was a child , about four or five years old , my father taught me what football was , and I loved it , but , I really liked the goalkeepers . Why have I liked football since my childhood ?
I think football gives you a lot of feelings and experiences .
I enjoy football because it is a way to forget problems and enjoy yourself a bit , because when you are playing football , you are n't thinking about other stuff , you only concentrate on the game .
Football is a sport where anything can happen . the best teams do n't always win and it is unpredictable . There is n't a dream team .
Football is a good way to do exercise because it is interesting and fun .
And if you do n't like doing sport , you can watch the matches of the teams around the world .
The most important invention is the mobile , because you can do whatever you want with only one communication device .
Not only do children have one , grandparents have one too .
But with this gadget , we have a big problem : people are becoming isolated ; we are living in our own world .
You can do a lot of things using your mobile , like call someone , text , take photos , listen to music , watch movies , play games , be woken up ( alarm clock ) , access the internet , check your e - mails , pay your bills , access social media , learn how to cook ... there are many more unimaginable things we can do .
But now , children want to have one as soon as possible . They do n't play hide and seek and do sports like before .
And one consequence of this is that they have health problems .
Another problem is if your mobile is stolen , the thief can access all your personal details , he can check your e - mail , see your photos , etc .
And people are becoming isolated . Once I saw a mother using her mobile instead of taking care of her baby !
In the future , we will probably be able to do almost everything using a mobile , but we must pay attention to how this affects our lives .
The pie charts illustrate the amount of household earnings allocation within regular families in two different years ( 2000 and 2010 ) .
Overall , in both years , the amount of earnings allocation was predominantly for housing , then followed by food / clothes .
There was a significant rise in the amount of budget allocated to both categories ( housing and food / clothes ) in 2000 and 2010 .
In contrast , vacation / leisure and misc decreased over the same period of time .
Regarding the pie charts , there was a significant increase in the amount of earnings allocated to housing and food / clothes , from about 35% and 25% in 2000 to about 50% and 35% in 2010 , respectively .
However , the allocation of household budget for misc , which was the lowest compared with other categories in 2010 ( around 15% ) , fell by 10% in 2010 from around 15% to approximately 5% .
Furthermore , there was a slight decrease in vacations / leisure allocation from 25% in 2000 to around 10% in 2010 .
These days , public transport shows no future .
Governments haven't been giving good ideas to improve public transport .
There are two good reasons for not using public transport in the future .
Firstly , the failure to construct more railway lines is one reason .
Consequently , people prefer to travel in their own car .
On the other hand , I think there are two aspects that could change the current situation .
The first is , the government could create a new plan of construction for trains .
The second aspect is , people could help by paying more tax to buy new buses .
As a result , we could have more comfortable public transport .
In my opinion , public transport could have a future if we all collaborate to improve it .
Unless we do so , I believe there is no future for public transport .
There are widely differing views on the issue of whether or not the benefits of studying foreign languages at an early age outweigh the drawbacks .
Some people would suggest that learning new languages before secondary school discourages students ' usual learning and that their understanding of other subjects would suffer .
However , I personally believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages .
The reasons for this are as follows .
Learn how to walk before learning how to run . The opponents contend that children confuse the words and phrases with their mother tongue .
Confronting challenges . Primary students struggle with the difference between first language and the one they are learning .
Thus , people believe that children learning foreign languages at primary school are worse than children who learn one later .
Nonetheless , I would contend that learning foreign languages at primary school brings countless benefits for children .
Primary school is the best time for learning . Children gain knowledge more easily and faster .
Not only is there less study burden when compared with secondary school , but they are able to communicate with foreigners as well as extend their social network during this period and in later life .
Rather than being concerned about the challenges , children would deal with them . It is particularly advantageous for them to grasp foreign languages during elementary school .
By way of conclusion , I once again reaffirm my position that the advantages of learning foreign languages at primary school far outweigh the drawbacks .
Given that those children would have better development in the future , as well as more free time .
It is a story of a boy who always found the way to tease his sister Sukh .
One day he had a fight with his sister . He even made her cry . Both of them stopped talking to each other and , after some days , the boy needed his sister Sukh 's laptop .
Sukh was so angry with him because he hurt her a lot . Sukh refused to give him her laptop and her brother started fighting with her again and he even slapped his sister .
Sukh started crying and she said she was not going to give him her laptop until he was sorry .
Her brother picked up her laptop and threw it and broke her laptop . Then the boy closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
In my opinion , people 's lives will change dramatically in 50 years or so , because the world is changing all the time , and we have a lot of technology and things to do .
What is more , they do not do the same things as their parents did .
To sum up , I think it is inevitable .
The door of the room was closed .
The room 's number was 666 .
He knew that she was inside , waiting for the last conversation about the life of Rose .
He pushed the door and went in .
Then she started talking : " Welcome , pretty boy , I have been waiting for you . Please sit down " .
He took a chair , staring at her with rage . "
As you well know , Rose 's life is in your hands " she said , and kept talking : " ... You are the only one that can save her life , but before , that you must keep your promise " . " I know " , he replied with a sad tone .
Then she took the document and started reading in a loud voice : " With this agreement your soul is mine " .
Micheal did not know what to think .
He loved Rose with his entire soul , a soul that he was losing .
Suddenly , he took the agreement and signed the piece of paper with his blood .
I do not care he thought . Maybe I lost my soul , but now she is alive .
On my last vacation , I went to France , to Paris , with my classmate Sebastian for 2 weeks .
Then we went to the stadium Parc des Princes , which we could not find ,
and due to lack of knowledge of the language , nobody would tell us which way to walk to the stadium .
By accident , we ran into a good fairy who , when she was young learned all the languages in the world and thus led us to our stadium .
We made friends with this fairy . After an entire day walking with her , it felt like we had known each other a lifetime .
After the first week in France , we found that in Paris there were a lot of people .
For this reason , we left with our new friend for Marseilles , where there was less traffic .
After spending two weeks with a fairy in France , we had to go back to school and the fairy did too .
How are things ? I have finished my exams now . I came back to Linares two days ago .
The exams meant that I did n't do much sport .
For me , sport is very important .
I believe that I am a boy healthy , but with all the exams I have abandoned good habits in my life .
I did n't have free time .
Do you do sports this year ?
What are you eating ?
Today I will speak with my manager . I will drive less and I go to places for mysheft .
I cycle at the weekend .
My mum says that I do n't eat fruits and vegetables , so I will eat more fruits and vegetables .
In my opinion , the Diet of Gym is very boring .
Do you know a new recipe for cooking chicken ?
One day , I will be like him .
We will meet soon , man .
First we went to our hotel .
It was near to Hyde Park .
We went to Hyde Park and sat on a bench .
An hour later , we went to the London Eye .
From the London Eye we could see all over London .
Then we went to Big Ben .
Then we got on a red bus and went to our hotel .
Reading opens new horizons , makes you imagine .
One of my favorite books is The Power of Your Subconscious mind .
This book tells you how to use the power of your mind , and how to make yourself happier .
Letter written to report on the awful environmental situation in my city !
We have already done a lot , but we still need to do more .
First of all , rubbish factories should be sent behind the city .
People who drop litter on the streets are one of the biggest problems .
So my proposition is to post some informative letters and posters around the city , and give bigger punishments for littering ! Also , the government should increase the number of rubbish bins and facility staff members .
Client search , customer support , conflict solutions
It takes you a very long time to get to your destination .
Our town takes care of the environment of our neighbourhood very seriously .
At these sites there are different kinds of containers for all sorts of rubbish which you can collect at home .
Like glass , plastic or paper containers .
In the supermarket , you can find a container for batteries .
Not only the supermarket has these containers . They are also in the schools of the neighbourhood .
In my opinion , this gives a good example of the involvement of the local government .
Another point that I 'm pleased about is that our town is kept clean by a special group of employees of our community .
Finally , I can say that they not only put containers for all your rubbish , but even special containers in the parks for the dogs ' ' pooh ' .
So this helps ensure that the children can play in a much cleaner park .
Studying overseas means not only changing conditions , but also facing many sorts of unknown pressure .
It is not easy to adapt to a new learning environment ; the language is the biggest difficulty .
Students have to do assignments in another language and use a different way of thinking .
The culture shock is what international students need to overcome .
Students want to make new local friends , but cultural customs and taboos could be a problem to notice and adapt to .
They have left their comfort zone , and everything is fresh .
As family and friends do not accompany them , students must do a lot , from basic living to future studies .
It is hard to live overseas alone . Therefore , making friends from the same country means that they can help one another .
Getting along with international friends is a great way to expand your horizons .
I was born in Danderyds hospital but lived in Stockholm . When I was four , I moved to Danderyd .
I have a big brother . He 's 14 and goes on Friberga as well . His name is Ulric and he 's in 8f2 .
My favorite activity is football . It 's great fun to play it with all my friends . I also like to play floorball but it is n't as fun as football .
I also like to play video games . I play with my friends . My favourite games are FIFA , NHL , GTAV and some others .
I have lived in stockholm and in two houses in Danderyd , but no other places .
I do n't know which is the best place I have been to but New York was cool , but I actually like F√•r√∂ most . It is an island next to Gotland and I have been going there since I was 0 years .
We always rent a little cottage from a sheep farmer and now we know his family .
We always go to the beach , which is very nice , and when it 's sunny and warm it is better than the Mediterranean .
I do n't know what I 'm proud of , but when I score a nice goal , I am proud because it feels good , especially when it 's an important goal that maybe will change the game .
I would like to be the best football player in the world , a Youtuber , or take over a big company .
It is often hard to get up in the morning . I always think just one more minute and then I fall asleep .
I do n't know if I can agree with that but I listened to them . :)
That I danced for two years , but I stopped because I did n't have time .
I would like to play a World Cup game and I also want to win the Champions League .
I do n't have a favourite movie . I like many but the movies I like the most are comedies and action adventure .
I do n't read many books .
I like a lot of songs , but I think it 's Let 's Do It Again by J Boog because I like the singer 's voice , it 's a soft song and it 's easy to sing too .
I also like Stolen Dance by Milky Chance because it 's a soft song .
I do n't only like soft music , I also like pop music and house music .
I like to watch South Park . It 's really funny and I have almost seen all 17 seasons . I also like to watch YouTube videos every day .
I like a lot of food , but the most meat food is good and pizza .
My favourite restaurant must have good meat and be really nice .
The aim of this report is to describe and assess shops which could be interesting for tourists .
The majority of people visiting Katowice are focused on three things : souvenirs , fashion and food .
It seems that there are not many places in the city center where you can find souvenirs like postcards or books about the history of Katowice .
Fortunately , visitors will find all of that in the Tourist Information Office and in shops on the outskirts .
The one which is really worth seeing is " Kato - Sovenirs " .
It 's the most popular sport in the world .
My favorite international league is the English premier league .
My advice to anyone who is starting this sport is to start it early and play it regularly not to lose fitness .
Also , joining a team would be a great idea .
The environment is an important part of our life , contributing in a positive way to our part of life without even concern about important parts for us to survive .
Humans can easily damage the environment just by throwing their waste away without recycling or ruining the places where animals live .
Deforestation can damage the cycle of nature .
Without forests , there ca n't be animals , and the human race will disappear .
Some people do n't even care and just do n't to earn money deforests the trees and sell them to make furniture .
They even do not plant other trees .
I notice that , in supermarkets , they use so much plastic just to cover a small thing or use a lot of plastic bags without even thinking about how harmful this is to the environment .
I lived for a short time in a place where the word " recycle " was completely unknown , but they used to do it because they were n't so rich .
Where I live now , I have noticed that we have the opportunity to recycle waste because it is a posh area .
In my opinion , the government should take care of all areas , whether an area is rich or poor .
Pollution has a negative effect on the environment . I saw on television that wild birds are healthier in rural area than birds from urban areas .
It is difficult for birds from urban areas to find proper food .
Some people from the area where I live usually feed the birds , but others do n't even care .
To keep all of nature alive , we must contribute everyone of us for future generations .
You can go by car at any time , but you ca n't by public transport .
You do n't have to wait for your car , but you must wait for public transport .
You do not pay any fare to travel in your car .
The aim today is to provide you with a description of my best friend .
Kike is my best friend . I met him when we were studying in primary school , when we were six or seven years old .
Afterward , we went to study at different schools , so , we were separated for ten years .
Moving on to the physical description , I want to say that Kike is a really tall man ; his height is 1.95 meters .
He has a strong voice that , with his appearance , makes him look impressive .
So , he is hard - working . He is a lawyer and always helps me with all my professional problems .
I want to turn to his hobbies . When he is n't working , he is riding a bike ,
every evening , he takes the bike and rides along some paths for more than forty kilometers per day , so he is a very good cyclist and it 's quite hard to cycle with him .
To conclude , I want to say that I 'm the godfather of his eldest son .
My wife is a very special person to me . I like her very much .
I met her at university 20 years ago . She is 4 years younger than me .
She is tall , slim and straight .
In addition to that , she has a pretty face , dark skin , dark eyes and long brown hair .
She is very kind , sensitive and quiet . She also has an attractive personality and a big heart , but she is very nervous .
She makes great food for us . I like to cook with her and eat from her hand .
She always works hard for our family .
Young people are most interested in fashion and computer games .
Girls usually follow the fashion bloggers and the fashion magazines .
Boys like following channels on youtube .
They like to take pattern modeled on older people who are popular on the Internet .
They like to exchange opinions about new stars .
People who are in fan clubs are interested in touring with their idols .
At this age , people like being better than their friends and they like to distinguish themselves .
I am writing to apply for the job you advertised .
I have already worked in summer camps in France and in Italy with children aged 7 - 13 . I am cheerful , energetic and hardworking .
I usually work in the kitchens , so it does not bother me .
I can go all over the USA without any problems and I can help the staff to get around if needed since I have a driving license .
Therefore , I think that I am a suitable person for the job .
Last night , I went to a restaurant with my family .
l love the place , and the nice decoration of the restaurant .
The waiter came and took the order .
My family ordered dinner , but l specially ordered pizza and Coke because l love pizza .
We ate the food and enjoyed it a lot .
l loved that day spent with my family .
l hope l can go at weekends with my family and friends .
I live in the center of Spain , in a small city .
When I was a child , my city was dirty because people threw their rubbish on the floor .
However , a few years ago , the government has paid more attention to the environment of our country . For example , they did a lot of advertising on television , in newspapers and on the internet to explain that rubbish is not good for our world .
Nowadays , we can see in all the streets a lot of bins and it is difficult to see rubbish on the floor because many people clean the city .
In the future , we must make an effort to improve our environment because we will want to give the same world or , if it is possible , a better world than before to our children .
Nobody can deny that transportation is one of the most important things in our life .
No country can live without transportation as it 's the real means of connection with each other .
Cars are much more convenient , but this does not mean that all other means of transportation are not important .
Sometimes , many people want to travel far away over long distances , so they need planes .
Other people prefer to travel by train as it 's faster and more comfortable than cars .
Many people like to travel by bike in order to decrease the pollution which is caused by car exhaust . From my point of view , I prefer travelling by car , which is more comfortable .
Now in every country we have a lot of means of transport , such as planes , trains , undergrounds , cars , ships , and rockets .
Public transportation is the main way to deliver people everywhere in a short time . In the past , they had to use camels to travel , which wasted a lot of time and caused tiredness .
We need a vehicle to reach our workplace .
If we use public transport services ,
we may be late getting to our office / work place .
So we must use a private vehicle .
Everybody thinks public transport is not comfortable for us , but environmentally , public transport is good for decreasing pollution and our energy sources are also decreasing .
In Lublin there is a beautiful castle .
It was built in the twelfth century .
The castle 's architecture is in the Neo - Gothic style .
In the castle there is the Holy Trinity Chapel .
It is in the Gothic style .
This tower is a precious monument of Roman art and it is one of the oldest buildings in Lublin .
It was a part of the borough of Castellan .
The castle also has a courtyard .
These days , in the castle there is a museum .
It is one of the oldest and the biggest museums in eastern Poland .
This museum has monuments of the superiority .
In my opinion , it 's one of the most fascinating places in Poland and the most wonderful site in Lublin . I think that everyone should visit this castle .
This restaurant has a good atmosphere because there are always people laughing and talking about funny things .
The food in this restaurant is very good and has a larger than normal size because it is much bigger than the usual food .
The famous dish of this restaurant is a huge hamburger .
This restaurant will be an amazing place to the call meet there because , like I said before , the atmosphere and food are amazing .
In my opinion , public transport will become more and more important in the future . Travelling by car may be convenient , but it also brings air pollution and traffic jams .
If there were only cars in a city , the city would n't have enough parking spaces and roads , all the cars would jam the city , and people would n't get to their destinations .
On the other hand , cars need more gasoline than buses , which emit CO2 and other kinds of waste gases into the air , leading to serious air pollution .
So , what we need is to devote much more money and time to improving the public transport .
Public transport will have a bright future ; in contrast , travelling by car will vanish from our lives .
My favorite way of travelling is by train .
The plane is faster than other ways to travel .
However , the plane is the most dangerous way to travel .
Boat is cheaper than other ways to travel .
However , boat is the slowest way to travel .
So , train is an intermidiate way to travel .
I like fighting , because I like to hit people .
I started this sport when I was 11 years old . My dad let me go boxing and I started that sport .
He is very good at this sport .
Today , people use more cars , which leads to more cars on the street , traffic and pollution .
I think is a better idea that people use public transportation instead of using private cars or motorcycles .
First , people do not have to buy their own cars .
Accordingly , people do not have to spend lots of money on the gas that they have to fill the tank with .
Also , they do not have to find a place to park either .
Therefore , these are the reasons why I agree with the form to reduce congestion and air pollution by encouraging people to use private cars less and turn to using more public transportation and other forms for transportation .
It was a cold night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on telly , called " Dare to Win " . I was with my brother when we decided to call . The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answered in time , and there are different things for the winner .
A few minutes later , we were listening to ourselves on the programme . We were so nervous , but it was exciting for us . Our goal on the programme was to get a free ticket to the most popular electronic party in the world .
Despite our nerves , we did well and our dream came true . Yeah , we 'll be glowing in the dark !
As the secretary of the English Language club , I am writing this proposal to persuade you as to why it would benefit both the students and the college if we received funding from you .
I am writing to apply for the job in the USA published in an advertisement last Monday .
I have recently finished my course in English in Cambridge , so I have fresh and improved English .
In order to help organise sports and evening activities , I am a young person of 12 years old .
Additionally , because public transport is expensive and does not have a comprehensive coverage of most cities , private cars are more attractive for most people .
I went to our new shopping centre last week in the downtown .
Actually , I am very happy to tell you that we have a lot of new stores , including an Apple store .
Long ago we had no stores to buy products or whatever we needed .
However , from now on , we can buy what we really need . On the other hand , this shopping centre may help a lot of people get back to working again .
A few weeks ago I went into the Apple store , and I bought a new mobile phone . It is awesome because it has reliable tools which allow me to do my daily work .
Some people say that a trip by car is more convenient than by public transport , but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations .
It is true that when travelling to a nearby place from your city , it is more comfortable getting there by car , because of the ease of having your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time taking cabs .
But public transport has a future for a lot of reasons . First , time . If the place you want to reach is really far , the different types of vehicles of public transport will get you there faster than your car . Also , the complications about the field , like if you want to go from America to Europe , there is no highway that crosses the ocean . You need an airplane and , unless you have one , you will not be able to achieve travel between continents with your car . A different reason is politics , because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska , you will not need to pass through Canada . Comfort is a really important reason , because driving for 8 hours is exhausting and it will also be unsafe . Economics is a factor too , because the wear and tear on your car will be more than in normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do . It will be more expensive than on public transport .
In conclusion , for me , it is a lie that public transport has no future . However , they have to make improvements to this , like the use of better types of fuel or energy . One way is using renewable sources of energy , such as solar , haeolic ( wind ) or hydraulic(water),Also , there are biodiesel and gasoline extracted from seaweed .
And public transport will be more important in a few years from now .
Dear Anne , Thank for your letter asking about my family and my friends .
Saying that , my family is the best and they love me very much .
My brother lives in Barcelona with his girlfriend and he is very happy with her .
Also , I have a lot of friends .
They are wonderful because they are always there when I need them .
Nowadays , it is possible to find any kind of TV programme you want and , yes , I consider that there is a lot of sport on television , but not too much .
People 's way of life has become more and more stressful .
When somebody gets home , he wants only to relax in front of the television .
Besides this , TV companies have understood sports provide this relaxing moment , mainly for men .
So they put on more and more sports programmes on television .
In this view , I think that though there are lots of sports on television , there are not too many , because people have looke for it .
In conclusion , I think that TV companies only want to sell their product and the people want to have their relaxing moment with the sports programmes .
We left our city on Monday , and we arrived in Carlos Paz on Thursday .
When the day came , we performed an amazing choreography and we went back home with 3 gold medals .
We really enjoyed this experience , just because we shared it as friends and we took dance lessons with the most professional and prestigious dance teachers in the world .
The album American Beauty/ American psycho is the sixth album released this year by the well - known American rock band Fall out boy , which has a huge following in several countries .
The album , with eleven tracks that reached number one , won gold and silver awards for the best - selling in various countries , such as the USA , Canada and the UK .
This American band is known for their lyrics that something different from other bands , something close to an emotional statement .
Even in this album , the band abandon their own roots and add a bite of the pop genre to it .
I really recommend this album because of the lyrics and the sound , because it grabs you , almost like great poetry .
I agree with the statement that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next years , for previsible reasons that I will explain in the following text .
Firstly , the biggest reason that people 's lives will dramatically change in the future is because of technology .
Technology is increasing throughout the world .
New technology has improve systems in many areas of society , mainly in information systems .
Information via the Internet had beem more quickly each day and it is reaching all parts of the world .
Furthermore , things and processes are evolving .
People 's lives are getting easier and more comfortable .
In industry , big machines are making new products for our benefit .
However , the advancement of technology , besides bringing advantages for everyone , will also cause disadvantages , such as unemployment , because machines will do the same work or work better than humans .
That 's why I agree that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
USA Summer Camp , I am interested in he vacancy at the summer camp .
I 'm a cheerful , diligent and organized person .
And I also love children .
I am accustomed to working with children because the last two summers I worked in summer camps and I have two little sisters that I love and who I spend a lot of time taking care of .
I am a hardworking and committed person in all respects .
These are the reasons why I 'm great for this job .
Also , the last summers helped me to be prepared for more things that children demand .
For example , I learned about organization , how to control big groups of children , and entertaining activities for children .
I hope you are interested in my application .
I will be waiting for your answer and thank you for your time .
Nowadays , the cost of buying a car that can take the whole family is not expensive anymore .
The car is not an expensive thing to have anymore .
As we know , the privilege of having a journey by car is more convenient than by public transport .
We can stop anywhere we want to stop .
We can visit every place with no time limitations .
If there was someone who asked me " What is your favorite sport ? and why do you enjoy it ? " I would tell them that my favorite sport is soccer because it has let me know how important teamwork is and I could always feel that there was a kind of power , like someone putting me into the water from a high place , to push me to run and kick the ball .
I have to say that feeling was really awesome .
It made me feel like happiness was running throughout my body .
I would suggest to people who want to start this sport , first you must find five to six friends to make a team , and then look for other friends to make another team , so that you can compete with each other to get the highest score .
Second , all you have to do is warm up your body , if you do n't warm it up before the race , you might hurt yourself .
Third , all you can do is play for fun with your friends .
Which is it the best ?
Public transport , our cars or natural transport such as a bike .
My teacher said that public transport has no future in our society , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . Nevertheless , I disagree with her opinion because if we use public transport we will pollute less .
Without travelling , people would be very bored , life would be very monotonous .
So , in the future we will dispense with types of transportation .
These days , we use cars to travel between countries .
People ca n't dispense with cars these days .
Families ca n't dispense with cars .
We should be careful of careless drivers .
We have searched to find the model of the 300 kw turbine on Zafrana and we did n't find the 300 kw turbine on Zafrana .
The capacity of used wind turbines on zafrana is 600 kw , 680 kw and 850 kw according to this site .
We searched for and found the 300 kw turbine is installed on Ras Ghareb in the Red Sea not on Zafrana and its model is Nordtank NTK 300 .
Which capacity and model will we work on ?
Nowadays people use cars a lot .
In the past , it was n't like that . People did not have cars . They just relied on public transport .
They had no choice , because life was difficult , and they had no money .
There were not any company cars , but now most people have cars .
There are a few people who use public transport , like students and people who have a low income . In my view , I can say the public transport might be going to e close because nobody is going to beclose
Last week my class and another one went on a school trip in Sicily .
We visited many cities , like Taormina , Siracusa , Agrigento , Marsala and Trapani , and we saw a lot of historical Greek monuments .
We stayed in three different hotels and , one day , we also went to the sea in Giardini Naxos .
The best thing I saw was the Valley of the Temples , because there were a lot of ancient temples and monuments and ruins and they were really beautiful and , also , the view was amazing !
That day , we had a great time and it was sunny and hot . I took a lot of photos and I learned new information about those important buildings .
It was a fantastic trip and I hope to do similar trips like that !
People are interested in everything unknown , mysterious and incredible .
They look for new experiences .
Nowadays , a very popular topic among teenagers is the existence of extra - terrestrials .
To be honest , I do n't believe in UFOs .
In the world there have been recorded a lot of cases where UFOs have been seen .
Stories about UFOs started in antiquity .
On the walls of caves are sketches and paintings which show strange creatures and flying saucers .
universe is expanding and we still know little about it .
Maybe we are not alone and UFOs exist ?
In addition , more and more scientists agree that aliens really exist .
I am a person that likes going to do exercise . For this reason , I like doing some sports , but the truth is that my favorite sport in the world is soccer .
I believe that playing soccer is an excellent activity , because in every game that people might like , there always has to be some rules .
These kinds of rules are very important , in my opinion , because when you do an activity and comply with the rules you are being a better person .
He is an important person because he is the president of the government in Spain .
He has been done several laws again Spanish citizens .
He studied a degree in law at university .
When Aznar was president of the government before him , he was like a minister .
I have been playing this sport since twelve years ago . This sport has taught me to respect others and not to assault them.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is that I do n't want to be weak . I would n't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule : the strong dominate the weak . When I step foot in the gym , I forget everything : school , home ... . Therefore , I enjoy it .
I ca n't imagine my life without taekwondo . It is in my blood , my soul . Taekwondo is not a violent sport as many people say , but what you have to know is what is in the brain and the heart of players .
I just got the 1st degree international black belt and I would like to tell anyone just starting this sport to use their abilities and skills for the right things .
This is my older brother 's story .
One day , my older brother went to a park where we often go to play tennis . He saw a boy who was holding a red hat crying on the branch , not knowing what to do . He stood behind a big tree and looked at the boy .
A few minutes later , some boy who looked older than my old brother approached the poor little boy . The little boy stopped crying , he My brother felt afraid because they looked like rube , but but he still wanted to help the little boy .
Suddenly , a rube boy grabbed the little boy 's clothes . The little boy cried out loudly . My brother was outraged . He ran at the rube boy and attacked him .
The little boy more and more sadly , tears rolled down from his eyes . My brother felt sorry for him . He gave the little boy his smartphone and put on some good music . The little boy stopped crying and started to smiled .
In the evening , the little boy 's mother came to take him home . He told his mother what had happened that day , and his mother smiled at my brother , and took the little boy home . My brother smiled and went home .
It was a sunny day . Like every day , Sara woke up and had breakfast with her children , then she went to her job .
When she had arrived at her office she had a phone call from the hospital .
They told her that her brother had had a car accident . First of all , she was shocked ,
Then she went quickly to the train station and she bought a ticket to London . When she was on the train , she had another phone call .
They told her that she had to bring $ 100,000 so they could do the surgery on her brother .
She came from a poor family and she lived with her children .
Her husband had died a long time ago .
in a car accident . When she heard what had happened to her brother , she was so anxious . Then a miracle happened . She found a big suitcase on the train she decided to open the bag because no one was on the train . So she opened the bag and she was surprised when she saw a lot of money inside the bag .
However , she took half of the money because of her brother .
After that , she went to the hospital
and paid the money for her brother 's surgery .
It is very important because this was a city and a very important ceremonial center .
There are other areas like " El juego de pelota " , which means the Ball Game . There is also a very important " Cenote " where they used to sacrifice pretty young girls to their gods .
Our Future Lives :
The past has already happened , we can not change it .
We do not know what 's coming in the future .
But we live in the present ; we live in the moment and benefit from it to the maximum .
If you ask someone about the future , the answers will be different , but all will be around two main topics , they will be either optimistic the about future or pessimistic about the future .
As far as I am concerned ,
I do believe that people 's lives in the future will change for the worse .
Not because I am a pessimist but due to several factors and conditions . Allow me to explain my opinion .
Firstly , we are living in an unstable world .
It is true that every day we have new innovations which help people and make their lives easier .
But from life 's experiences we can learn that the hidden target of human beings is not to help each other to lessen the burden of life .
Humans are looking for power and they apply the law of the jungle , the strongest beat the weakest .
There is a categorisation of countries ; there are developed countries , emerging ones and countries on the way to development .
What are the criteria of this ranking ? and ...
These questions and a lot of queries of many people looking for a convenient answer .
Hence , the above indicated details support the idea that there will be a change in people 's lives but in a negative direction .
In addition , a general view of human innovation shows that the majority of people 's creations have a bad effect . This effect exists even in people 's lives or in themselves .
And unfortunately , this bad impact exists in almost all areas of life .
Chemical drugs can help people to heal and recover from diseases , but they have another hidden effect .
This effect always leaves people suffering later , after use .
Therefore , The aforementioned information above shows that our future could be worse than our present .
To summarize , people 's lives see fast change and development , but generally , this evolution affects people .
We should live in a stable and peaceful world .
We must stop all wars , conflicts , and impose human principles and values .
It specializes in barbecue , beers and wines .
The building is quite wide and at the front you can see a huge welcome sign .
The service provided by the restaurant is exceptional . For example , the waiting time is very short .
And it is very well organised .
In terms of food quality , the standard is extraordinary . They are well known for their roast meat .
Trains are going to be used forever .
There is a hotly debated issue relating to whether students should take at least one year to work or travel before they go to university .
And the topic of people 's views can be approached from different angles due to its complexity .
Some people support this " gap year " theory , while others seem to disagree .
After carefully considering this issue , I also develop my own points of view .
I favor the former statement . That is , I think students should have a gap year before they go to university , based on n1 , n2 .
I disagree with you about the future of public transport .
Every day , the fuel that we use in our cars is more expensive than using public transport .
Nowadays , people use their cars to travel for work , for holidays ...... but if the petrol were cheaper , they could travel a lot .
It would be a good idea if taxes were cheaper than the taxes on other things such tobacco , alcohol ....
What do you think about that ?
Although traveling by car is really interesting , using public transport still has its advantages . By using public transport you 're saving effort . When driving a car for a long distance , you will get tired . Some people do n't have enough money to buy their own car .
I saw you uploading the cat in the glass bottle on Facebook .
I want to say a few words .
Maybe you just think it 's fun but it 's been a good cause for your cat because of you r joke .
If you want to raise animals , you must take care of them , love them and treat them like family .
Although they are not human , they also have feelings .
Once you raise it , it will regard you as its owner .
It relies on you alone .
Furthermore , your abuse of the cat has violated not only ethics but also the law .
I hope you can take down the photos of the cat being abused and you can really reflect . Do n't repeat the same mistakes .
Keeping a cat is not a simple matter and it needs real love and good care .
So if you decide to keep the cat must be the best , you can spend more time with the cat .
Always pay attention to whether the cat has been sick .
In the holidays you can go for a walk with a cat .
It is not a difficult thing to do .
The diagrams below show the five stages of the process of making bank notes .
Design is the first stage , which includes three parts : background , artwork and security issues .
After the preparing of metal plates by skilled machinists , they take sheets of bank notes . There are three requirements for this : colour on both sides , special ink and images that are slightly raised .
The most important step is inspection : printed sheets are manually inspected .
If you apply a for job like this you must be the person who already been applied this job USA SUMMER CAMPS
Why should I get this job ?
Because I really love to work with people of all ages , and I would like to have this post and I 'm an energetic and hardworking person .
Therefore , looking after children aged 8 - 12 years is n't an easy task , but as a father or parent you must always give them good care in terms of your responsibilities .
Working in the kitchens means doing all about i.e cleaning and washing the floors .
Best regards
There is no future for public transport . That is true , but I think that people are very comfortable and do n't think about the environment .
On the other hand , public transport is the cheapest way to travel , although people do n't think of that aspect .
Secondly , you can drive your car everywhere . It does n't matter what time it is or where you would like to go . Travelling by car is much more convenient and comfortable than travelling by bus , by subway or by train .
You can put all the bags that you want to take in your car .
These aspects or advantages are all that I can say about this topic .
Hello ,
My name is Anna . I am a very cheerful person and I have a creative personality , so I enjoy planning activities or organising sport events in a special and colorful way .
I really love children and taking care of them . I also have experience of working in summer camps and had a good experience making delicious food because I already did these things in other camps .
I think that I have given good reasons and I hope that you will accept me .
Goodbye . Anna .

I chose this invention that I think helped humanity to communicate more easily .
Motorola was the first to do something to a mobile phone . It was on 3 April 1973 and the first to do so was an employee of Martin Cooper .
Cooper made mobile phone history in April 1973 when he made the first ever call on a handheld mobile phone .
Today was a good day . Not every day is as good as this was .
It started when I woke up around seven o'clock and I was n't tired at all .
It smelled terrific , and tasted so good .
It was pancakes and egg with bacon .
After that I played with my brothers out in the garden .
They usually do n't want to be with me , but today we played all day long .
It was such fun and I could n't stop smiling .
The weather was also good today . The sun was shining and there were no clouds in the sky .

My wife and I went to Ushuaia for four days but on the second day we realised that my wife had forgotten her glasses so we decided to come back .
When we arrived , there were a lot of Matias ' friends in our house listening to loud music , playing games and drinking .
We told them that they had to leave our house immediately .
When everyone was out , we told Matias off because he organised a party without our permission .
He told us that he was really embarrassed about what had happened and he apologised for his attitude .
In my opinion , in future people wo n't use public transport .
It will not be trendy because everybody will have his own car .
These cars will use alternative energy , for example energy from the Sun .
Modern science is trying to find new , more economic sources of energy .
Do you have a best friend in your life ?
What is the meaning of friend ?
A friend is a person who will be there in your hard times and happy times , and a friend always encourages you in all the things you choose in your life .
A friend will also be there when you are sad and in worse times . There is no ex'friend so respect your friend and they will respect you more .
Secondly , the student who has a good body shape can easily make new friends , and joining a sports team allows students to maintain a good body shape .
For instance , students joining a sports team need to do some basic physical training to maintain their body shape .
According , for a boy or girl , having strong muscles can make them look more attractive .
Therefore , the student joining a sports team can maintain a good body shape and it will let students more easily make new friends .
It is said that when you survive a situation which has taken you to the limit , you change .
And you can never return to being the person you used to be .
You are no more the person that people knew .
Every hard situation can be got over easily when you make a big effort .
Peter had been thinking about this secret party for months , since the time he knew his mother was healed .
He had been taking care of her , so he was prevented from going to university .
He had to refuse all his dreams suddenly .
However , destiny had given him another chance to follow them .
She felt blessed as she had been given such a perfect son .
It is said to happen once in a lifetime .
Peter had been kissed by his mum before , but this time was quite different .
The environment is a combination of the air , earth , water and forest and all these things are interlinked with each other .
Most importantly , all species of animals and human beings are a part of this ecosystem .
The human being is the most wise and intelligent of all of these .
However , he is mainly responsible for disturbing this ecosystem through various activities .
Let 's talk about one of them , which is ' cleanliness ' . Nowadays , we all know that we are spreading garbage near our houses and offices .
This may be due to people not being aware of the consequences of this bad habit - spreading the rubbish .
But , these days , with education , people are becoming more sensitive and responsible towards the environment .
Along the same lines , inhabitants of my village do lots of work to make their area clean and hygienic .
They collect household waste in a dustbin and dispose of it by the proper standard procedure .
They collect and segregate the rubbish into separate containers .
For example , they collect plastic waste in a yellow dustbin , while liquid and solid , degradable waste goes in a red container .
This makes it easy and convenient to identify the waste types .
To conclude , I would like to say that , nowadays , people are becoming more aware and environment - conscious through education .
Today in my class there was a discussion on television and education .
Television is an object that helps people to know the news in real time .
There are advantages and disadvantages ; television can also cause a dependence , cartoons and " stupid " programs can harm young people most .
Today , there are many children that have a dependence on television , they prefer to stay at home to watch the various children 's TV programs , while once our parents preferred hanging out with their friends .
Television can be a useful instrument if it is used with caution . Therefore , I recommend using it less to prevent damage to the mind .
In order to help reduce pollution , I take action using the three " Rs " : reduce , reuse and recycle , so I am more and more eco - friendly .
I reduce the use of unnecesary power at home . In other words , I turn on a light that I need while I use it ; I take cooler showers ; I heat only the necessary rooms .
In order to reuse , I convert all things reusable , for example , a plastic bottle as a plant pot ; a glass bottle as a food container . I take my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a plastic shopping bag if a salesman offers me one .
Recycling is another way to be ecological .
Today , we have more items to recycle as long as we clean them properly and put them in the proper bin , which will be used by specialized factories to make them into other items .
As long as I try to keep doing things in an eco - friendly way , I realize that I am giving a little from my side and I feel I am caring for my environment .
Hello ! ! How are you ! ?
Next I am going to Italy to see the Pope . If you want I am going to Barcelona and I would like to go with you .
PS : we have to meet
Hi Jo ,
In my opinion , it is a good idea to spend some time travelling , because you will have an opportunity to think about your future , but in my city , because of the crisis , there is very little work for anyone .
Here , there are monuments , churches or famous people and perhaps in the future you would like to become a history teacher .
Although now that the holidays are coming , they need people to help and ride the amusement park or work the lights of the fair .
If you come to Linares , you could amuse yourself , and if you come forward to work you can do it .
You have to come here because Holy Week in Linares is nice and the show is spectacular and if you want to have fun , I like the bulls .
But if you want to decide , I 'll try to help you .
On the other hand , music is the best for relaxing and enjoying yourself .
You can devote more time to doing both .
If I were you , I would go running in the morning and I would go to music classes after lunch .
I hope this helps you and you will make the best decision .
I agree with this affirmation because public transport is more expensive than a car , is slow and is less economical .
A car is less expensive , more comfortable , faster and safer .
Every time a car is used and more economic .
In my opinion , the car is more advantageous than the car and the car is more useful .
To my mind , this is not right .
First of all , travelling by car is very expensive .
For example , travelling by train is cheaper and travelling by plane is faster .
Secondly , it 's not comfortable , because you drive every day instead of relaxing and enjoying the environment .
It is said that people prefer going by bus to a nearby place , but some of them do n't think the same .
Public transport has plenty of advantages .
Some people ca n't afford to buy a car or to pay for petrol , as the price is constantly rising , so using public transport is an economical way to travel .
On the other hand , it helps to reduce the pollution made by cars , ..
Besides , it will always be useful for people who ca n't drive .
The reason is they are tired of using public transport and they would get everywhere faster .
In the future , cars will be so cheap that everyone will have one . Thus , it will mean the end of public transport .
To sum up , I would say that people will use public transport more and more , as petrol is getting expensive .
The picture illustrate the process of making notes .
This includes some of the most important steps .
It is the first step that costs troublesome , some . Some things must be included in the considerations , such as background colour , artwork , security issues .
Then , preparation of the metal plates and skilled machinists are needed .
Printing is the next step . Usually , sheets of bank notes are printed , because there are some special requirements for the printing ; colour of both sides , special ink , images slightly raised .
The last step is the inspection . Sheets are manually inspected .
The inspection always has three results : the good quality sheets , the bad sheets and the partially damaged sheets .
If the printed sheets are good quality , they will be packed and distributed . Some partially damaged sheets will be cut into separate or packed or dispatched . The bad sheets will be disposed on . The destruction will be secure .
I have been going swimming since 1998 , when I was ten years old .
At the moment I do n't practice because I do not have time , but a miss it !
Now I go to the gym and do weight lifting three times a week . Aerobic exercise every day and yoga twice a week !
I always feel very well after coming back from the gym .
but when she ca n't go , I go alone .
My coach is very friendly and helps me .
Television is one of the most important AV media in the world .
You can use it for many purposes , according to your needs . There are a lot of channels playing many roles . For instance , education , movies , songs , sports , news and so on . Television is not only for entertainment , but also for education . Television can entertain you through it s entertainment channels , and television can educate you through it s educational channels .
In this day and age , most people have their own car or vehicle for their transportation .
It is also convenient for people who are rushing to work , meetings and so on .
However , I do not agree with this statement , because public transport is needed for people who do not have vehicles or during economic downturns .
Public transport is cheap and friendly to the environment .
Firstly , the fare for public transport is cheaper compared with buying a new car .
People do not need to save large amounts of money to buy a car .
They can use the money in a more useful or meaningful way , such as for investment in property .
The fare for public transport is less than owning a vehicle when you compare bus fares to filling a whole tank with petrol .
Some more money is needed to pay a parking fee for parking .
Because everybody has to leave for another place in their own car and carbon dioxide is released from cars .
Public transport is a way to reduce air pollution , because it can carry more than a dozen times the people at a time and reduce the number of people travelling in their own vehicle .
Lastly , public transport is always blamed by people for being slow and more trouble than using their own vehicle .
Although public transport is slow , it also does not take a long time for people to reach their destination , because public transport nowadays is faster and enough .
In conclusion , public transport is needed by everybody in a necessary time .
It can always make us save money and make the environment more natural and fresh .
Nowadays , the space needed for countries enlarges , whereas the area for farmland , forests and wetland is getting smaller .
This kind of situation brings all kinds of problems for mankind and animals .
The large - scale building projects have taken the space which should belong to the animals .
Some kinds of animals will move to the urban areas , steal food from us and sleep on the streets or in the underground .
Although most of them might be caught , only a small number of them might be adopted by friendly humans .
On the other hand , the expansion of a city increases pollution and all kinds of garbage . The air pollution is much more serious now , and seeing blue sky is almost impossible in some big cities .
Although the medical skills are getting better , the percentage of people who get cancer is still increasing .
In conclusion , large - scale building projects take the living resources from animals , increase the possibility of getting cancer , and so on .
Only if the government develop more technical property , pay , pay more attention to environmental protection , such as planting more trees and grass in the cities , and bringing in a special law for those missed animals will we help decrease the harm that building projects do to us .
For me , my family members are not my best friends although I wish they were .
If they are your best fiends , they will guide you and help you to be the best of you , they wo n't hurt you or turn their backs on you .
But on the other hand , you may be punished or they may yell at you when you do something wrong .
So it is not always a good thing , unless they are open - minded or have their own methods to punish you in a gentle way that wo n't make you regret telling them your faults or mistakes .

Listen , I will tell you about getting to my apartment .
There are several types of transport in my town .
But if you land early in the morning , the most convenient and fast transport is taxi , which does n't cost much to my house .
There is the possibility of rain .
I 'd better stop now and get ready for your visit .
Please write to me soon .
Thank you very much for writing me this letter .
Now , to answer your question , I have many favourite places near my town because I live in a lovely little town , but there is one place that is special to me : ' A Fervenza do Pedregal ' . '
It is a very quiet place . Because of its location , in the middle of the forest , only a few people know how to get there .
You can only get to ' A Fervenza ' by walking or riding a bike , but it is impossible to get there by any other ways .
It is an incredible forest , the ground is covered in low grass and there is a little river where you can swim . It is the perfect place to have a quiet day .
That is all I can tell you about this place . I hope that my answer will help you with your project .
What is your last name ?
A pretty girl like you is still single ?
Stop it . I have been single for a while .
I 've been playing this sport since I was six years old .
I say to people that want to try this sport that it ' s easy if you love it .
You are at an advantage if you start when you are young .
This sport can help your health and anyone can learn to play volleyball .
In Italy , volleyball is very common , especially in my region .
If you try this sport in the wrong way you could have health problems . For example , you could have problems with your hands , in your neck and in your legs .
My name is Jose .. I 'm 25 years old and I 'm from Madrid , Spain .
My hobbies are going out and travelling around the world .
I love music like you and my favorite group is U2 .
I 'm an only child and I study Marketing in the morning and work in the evening in a mall .
Do you like studying Law ?
I look forward to hearing your news soon .
Hello , my name is Sophie Nielsen . I was born in 2002 in Sweden and I still live here .
I have got one sister named Ingrid and she is 8 years old .
In my spare time , I like to hang out with friends and play soccer .
I also do homework but it 's not something I do because I like it .
The accomplishment I am the most proud of was when I scored four goals in a soccer game .
The best place I have visited is my house in Spain .
I would like to change the fact that I do n't read so much , because it 's easier to learn things if you read .
Three words that I can describe myself with are :
I think people will be surprised to know that I was born in 2002 and not 2001 , but I was born the on first of October , so there 's not so much difference .
My favorite song is " All about that Bass " by Meghan Trainor , because the song makes me feel good and happy .
My favorite movie is " The fault in our Stars " , because it 's very good and I really like the characters and the story .
Emily knew she would have to come to a decision soon .
It was a cold night when her boyfriend asked her to marry him .
They were spending the weekend in the countryside . He had rented a cabin but he had n't checked the weather , and a strong blizzard arrived leaving them without communication by phone or by car .
The problem for Emily was that her boyfriend was as cold as the weather .
She thought he was so boring , but she did n't want to be alone . she did n't know how to live on her own and Emily was utterly terrified of being alone .
The purpose of this report is to make people more aware of the importance of taking care of the environment in order to eradicate this problem which has serious consequences nowadays .
Acid rain and global warming are issues which have been brought about by careless people .
on the one hand , if we avoided causing pollution in ours cities , we could have a more healthy lifestyle than in the past .
MEASURES IN FAVOUR OF TAKING CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT
The council is carrying out a project in order to eradicate rubbish from my town .
This project is focused on separating the rubbish at green points of the city and they also have to keep the neighbourhood as as as is possible .
To sum up , taking care of the environment should be an obligatory task for us .
The main reason for this is , provided that we bear in mind that we must collaborate with all arounds , we will keep the world on our hands .
I am writing in response to your advertisement for work with children this summer in summer camps . I have looked after children aged 5 - 10 and it was a fantastic experience . I have worked at a school in North Africa as a volunteer and learnt a lot about children . I think that I 'm a suitable person for the job because I am an energetic and cheerful person and very hardworking , I love working with children and I like organising different types of activities . I 'm not very good at cooking , but I can learn very fast .
I think that I could do a fantastic job .
Combating the destruction of the environment , this is a serious problem throughout the world .
Nowadays , many trees and grassland areas are damaged in many countries , lots of building are constructed .
And people should pay attention to this problem and try to solve it .
There is no denying that the environment is changed by the behavior of people and animals .
For instance , people need too many places to build the modern society , so they cut down lots of trees , burning many grassland areas .
Another factor is that the animals do not control themselves and eat the plants leading to the destruction of the ecosystem .
Nowadays , the transportation has become more perfect , and the people 's lives have become more convenient .
Although this change makes the life of people efficient , the problem should not be ignored .
It would really be helpful if the government made tighter restrictions . In today 's world , there are lots of construction companies and factories are not admission , they are destroying the forest , farmland and wetland , discharging waste water and emitting greenhouse gas . It leads to a serious environmental problem .
So the government should oversee these companies , and if companies do not obey the rules or laws , they should be fined and closed down .
Taking the train is more cost effective than taking a car to work , as petrol is costly and the new transportation office has reduced the cost of tickets to assist with the daily living expenses we encounter .
The other benefit of taking public transport is fewer people are taking cars , reducing the amount of toxic gases released into the environment .
Abortion is an immoral act that people perform as everyone has the chance to survive and nobody has the right to decide about anyone 's life .
Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral actions , as these fetuses are being deprived of their rights , since they already have a life .
People have to be made aware about abortion in order to decrease the number of women having abort .
Furthermore , abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women have died because of this .
Children have to be protected before and after life . That is why abortion has to be stopped .
I believe public transport will have a big role in the future for several reasons :
1- Inflation in the population ; the roads will not be able to bear or endure huge numbers of cars .
2- I think in the future transport and roads will be more organized , more than these days .
3- In the future , people will be more concerned about energy , so transport will be more used .
4- Transport will be more economical than private cars .
5- Many people ca n't drive , like children and old people .
6- Not everyone has the possibility to buy a car .
Because of all these reasons , I believe transport will have a bright future .
Next , from 3rd Qtr to 4th Qtr the sales remained steady at $ 850 .
The last sales of the last year were $ 850 .
Karate is one of the best sports I have ever enjoyed in my life . One of the reasons behind my passion for karate is that it 's a means of taming the mind and the body .
I have learned to get control of myself when someone teases me , and to be alert as well . Also , it helps me to always look slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well . People who want to start doing karate have to be patient .
They should immerse themselves in daily exercise as well as eat healthy meals to keep them active . for instance , it 's advised to eat large amounts of fruits and fresh vegetables because they contain a lot of vitamins that the body needs to work properly .
My favorite sports are football , basketball , Formula One and Tennis .
I started to play football when I was four years old .
He came to Real Madrid 5 years ago and he is the best player in the team .
I watch two matches at the weekend in the Spanish league or NBA .
I started to watch Formula One because of my father . This is his favourite sport .
Tennis is my brother 's favourite sport .
That is one of my favorite sports .
How is it going ?
What a big surprise : you are married .
I 'm very pleased to accept your invite .
Now I 'm thinking about the present . What do you like ?
I look forward to hearing from you .
Sports are very beneficial for our health .
I like to play football because it 's a very exciting game . It takes only 90 minutes . Whenever I get the opportunity , I play football .
Driving a car while listening to music is much more fun for most people , so maybe that 's why most people love to drive rather than take public transport .
In contrast , some people hate getting caught in a traffic jam , so they prefer public transport . Some other reasons might be rising gas prices , car crashes or hating driving !
As a result , I think both driving and public transport have their roles and we need to use each one in the right situation .
I have two reasons why I do .
First , there are many kinds of train .
For example , in our country , " Shinkansen " which means bullet train , is famous and very fast .
" Blue train " , which has many beds on the train and we can sleep comfortably on the train .
Thus , not only to ride but also to watch trains is very interesting for me .
Second , travelling by train is safe and reasonable compared to planes .
Recently , although there are many LCC careers we can choose , it is still expensive to travel by plane .
Travelling by train is cheep and getting a ticket is easy for us in our country .
And terrorism is scarce also .
A plane which was travelling from Egypt to Russia was exploded by terrorists last month .
Compared to the plane , the train is relatively safe because it can only move on the land .
These reasons are why I think traveling by train is best .
What did you do yesterday ?
I prefer other kinds of films than comedy , but yesterday there were n't any good films at the cinema .
What kind of films do you like ?
I like thrillers and the action films because they are never boring .
Do you prefer watching films at home or going to the cinema ?
I prefer to watch films at the cinema because there are n't any distractions or noises and the quality of films is better .
There are several efforts that we can make in order to save the environment .
We should start , little by little , to help it .
First of all , I want to emphasize reducing the use of plastics .
It 's a basic thing and a habit that we can start easily on our own .
Plastics are non - biodegradable materials which decompose after 1000 years .
Non - biodegradable plastics could actually pile up in the landfill and cause the land on our earth to be occupied .
Besides , it destroys the marine ecosystem in such a way that the seabirds or fish are feeding on plastic .
This causes their reproductive systems to be destroyed .
Hence , we should bring our own recycling bag or basket every time we go shopping and resist the temptation to get plastic from the shops .
In addition , we should use public transport or carpool in order to reduce the CO2 emissions into the environment .
If the distance to the destination is short , we could replace driving with walking or cycling .
That 's the decent way to reduce the adverse environmental impact and we will be able to protect our Earth .
Since GM crop technology started to be implemented it has implied in favourable socioeconomic changes .
This technique makes weed control easier , resulting in cost savings and yield gains , leading to increased global production of crops such as corn , cotton , canola and soybeans .
He said kindly,"I bought you a present . Open it , Tom " .
Tom opened the big bag . Oh ! This is a big surprise . There was a football in it which he had always wanted to buy .
There were some words : goal ! keep going ! Keep looking ! said his mom . Look !
There was also a cup in it . It said " do n't give up on your dream , keep going!go!we stand by you ! come on "
Tom loved it . " Thanks mom , thanks dad ! " Today is the best day of my life . Thank you ! "
" You deserve them , Tom ! You worked hard all the time this year "
My name is Anna . I am one of many new students at Ton Duv Thang university .
I 'm nineteen years old and from this city but living in a dormitory at Ton Duc Thang university .
I love Ton Duc Thang university so much .
I like the friendly students and helpful teachers .
I enjoy reading books , cooking , playing with my dog and singing .
Also , I love music . I often listen to pop music , R and B , and a little Rap .
Hence , the new luxury cars are getting cheaper and more powerful .
The pace of life has been speeded up , people do n't have time to wait for a taxi or at the bus stop to get their work done , they want their work done in the blink of an eye .
So the need for buses has become unnecessary and our own cars are simply time - consuming .
Even kids start to learn to drive at fifteen and most parents gift cars on their sixteenth birthday .
We can see the future of transportation by comparing the numbers of cars and buses .
Students have started to use their own cars rather than the bus .
So I think the future of public transportation is gloomy .
Cricket has been a part of me since when I was a kid .
Cricket brings a passion in me . Whenever and wherever it 's possible , I find a way to start the game .
The best part of this game is batting . Whether someone knows how or not , he first prefers to bat .
So , so I also prefer to bat and hitting hard rather than bowl .
It 's a very simple and wonderful sport .
If you play cricket you are surely going to burn many bad calories in your body .
In India , cricket is worshipped and players are lord .
The best part of this game is you can play with every age group at the same time .
I was very interested in making my career through this , but due to my studies , I ca n't make an effort toward this goal .
So , if are going to play this sport , do note that there are some rules and be sure that you have all the safety equipment with you . Please do n't forget to take pleasure in batting first .
My friend went there . She talked to me about it so much .
Indian people make amazing food , but it 's so spicy . Indian people dance in an amazing way .
It was my dream to go there one day .
I 'm writing to you to tell you that I am coming to your home next month . I hope that you are at home because I need your help . I want to buy a present for Mary and I do not know what her favourite colour is .
When I stay with you I would like to go to a Spanish restaurant .
You have been my best friend since 1984 , when I was born near to your house .
Now I have lived in Badajoz for ten years . We moved here to go to the beach every day . I like the beach and the sun , especially in summer when the sun is in the sky .
I like dancing and singing too . I 'm very happy singing on the beach , especially if you are with me .
Yes , I think it can also educate .
As time goes by , technology is rapidly improving .
More and more gadgets are invented , such as televisions , smartphones and so on .
Using will not only get entertainment but also acquire knowledge .
For instance , there are numerous programs that we can choose .
It is a good time to turn to the entertaining programs , when we feel bored and gaze at the wall all day .
Television provides a variety of educational channels as well .
We . We can learn how the different animals feed themselves .
Above The above statements can ensure a rich and abundant life .
I think in 50 years many things will change . We will learn in our homes .
We wo n't have schools .
We will do homework at home and send it to the teachers .
They will correct our tasks and send them to us again .
There wo n't be supermarkets .
There wo n't be a post office because we will be able to send anything via the Internet . All jobs will be on the Internet .
They will serve us instead of human servants .
There will not be any poor people in the streets .
We will live happily .
I hope that in the future we will live peacefully and happily .
Hi , I am Amy . I would like to spend two months studying in England , two months doing volunteering in a children 's charity and the last two months travelling in the UK . What do you think of my plan ? I will not only improve my English skills but also devote myself to getting along with children .
Most important of all , I will have an adventure in an unknown place in the UK . I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
I would like to invite you to join the road trip with me . it will be an amazing experience if we are together for this trip .
If you can go with me , just let me know .
Your friend Amy
I usually run in the morning , when my roommates are still sleeping . I get up and run in the playground .
When I am running , all the pressure I felt is gone .
I am filled with hope .
I started running because I suffered from neck pain and my left leg was not comfortable when I sat all day .
Furthermore , I wanted to reduce my weight as well .
I bought shoes , clothes and a GPS watch . I told myself : now it is a challenge , I must defeat myself . The first day was so painful . I was tired to die when I only ran nearly 3 km , but things became better and better , and now I can run 10 km .
If you want to start running , first , you need comfortable shoes and clothes , and secondly , to make a plan , like how long should I run today . Remember , appropriate rest is necessary .
Do n't set a goal that you ca n't achieve , or you will lose your confidence soon .
The most important thing is your willpower .
First I will ask a question of you . If this was your own house , which you bought for a lot of money would you break it for no reason ?
Of course the answer is no ! Everyone knows that " Earth is our home . " It is bigger than a house .
We have Earth first , then people , than our house .
Earth is our home , we all have to protect it .
But now people are destroying it .
Just for money for more houses , but if we destroy it , we will all die . Our money will be gone , our house will be gone , we will have nothing .
Besides , some people destroy farmland to build houses , but if one day there is no farmland , then what should we eat ? Nothing at that time . We could n't eat anything!So what should we do ?
The forest brings us fresh air , but if there are no trees , what will happen ?
If we ca n't breathe , we will die , too !
So my idea is that all the countries and all the people stop using farmland , forests and wetland to build houses , grow more trees , protect our world , our home star !
The lecturer disagrees with the paragraph suggesting that the mentioned test developed by Alan Turing does not answer the main question : Can a computer think ?
First , the lecturer talks about " Saran " , who proposed a challenge to prove that Turing 's test was not conclusive , and that he created a paradox .
He selected people to go into a Chinese room . There was a computer in the Chinese language with different symbols . The Americans showed different behavior . They did not understand what was on the computer screen .
This was different to the original test mentioned in the text , where all the participants were American and native speakers of that language . It was really easy to understand what was on the computer screen .
Second , the text support that the computers were evaluated by the same people that submitted the test .
For example , for young people in college , their studies are more important , as well as books , seminars , travelling , etc .
Nowadays , public transport has become a very important way to go to work , to travel to other cities , or to simply go to visit a friend on the other side of the city .
I agree , for many people , travelling by car is much more convenient . However , in my opinion , there is still a long future for public transport .
I am happy to hear from you .
Your plan sounds great and I will be pleased to spend a few days with you and your family .
My grandmother is going to visit me in July , so I would prefer to see you in August .
My younger sister wants to go to the beach , so if she is not a problem , she could come with us .
Or she can stay at home .
I think it is more fun to stay together in your apartment . We could tell horror stories to each other at night , before sleeping .
I really like spending time on the beach , but there is a lot of time , so we could go to the swimming pool if your parents say yes .
Also , we could go to the bar to drink some juice or go to eat an ice - cream .
Do n't forget to write soon .
Science , I just remember I have always liked motor racing , but one of my favourites is Formula 1 .
I like cars , and I like high speed , that is why I love Formula 1 races .
The Formula 1 season starts in early spring and ends in late autumn .
I try to watch every race every fortnight and the training the day before the race .
I like Ricki Rikonen so much . He is a Ferrari team driver .
Ricki is not the fastest driver on the track , but he drives very safely .
Ferrari make one of the fastest cars in the world , but this season they are not so fast on the Formula 1 track as they were in the past .
If someone likes cars , then they should go to Formula 1 races to hear the bolid engine sound . I think that is the best sound I have ever heard in my life .
Formula 1 is also a dangerous sport . The drivers are exposed to the risk of accidents at high speed .
I wish good luck to all Formula 1 drivers !
Michael is one of the most important economists in the world . He has written a lot of books about the economy and finance in the USA and Europe .
He decided to write a short essay about capital market abuse , so he considered travelling to Italy and picking up some financial data from the Italian central bank .
The key idea of this essay was the following : Italy in the time of Berlusconi almost went bankrupt , but Michael is trying to prevent the Italian economy condition simply because he likes Berlusconi too much .
He received a lot of criticism simply because many economists and econometricians in the world do not trust the source that he used in his essay . Moreover , they thought that he received money from the Italian government .
Two years after his essay was released , he would understand that his essay was wrong . Moreover , Michael would want to apologise to many people who read his essay , so , Michael now goes home , takes a cup of tea , and goes to bed . Thus , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
One day , a man and his wife were trying to find a place that was shallow and without pollution to cultivate . They were poor ; they did n't have the necessary resources , but the husband worked so hard because his wife had had an accident . It happened one day that his wife was working on a campaign for the conservation of endangered animals . She went to a place in search of animals . She heard a sound in a dark place in the jungle , so she went to investigate what that was . A creature that had never been seen attacked her . Her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy , the wife of the man , on the floor . They asked her if she was OK , but she did n't answer , so her partner took her to the doctor . There , the doctor said that she was OK but she would never hear again unless she paid 1 , 000 dollars for an operation .
The man has already saved 500 dollars , but it is not enough .
One day , the son of Lucy and her husband went to carve holes in the dirt to make a game , he made five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewel that had belonged to generations of gods . So he started throwing that for fun . One time that he took the jewel , it consumed the mind of the little guy and that made the jewel emit some sounds that only giants could hear , so a mountain stood up that was the face of a giant and he perceived negative vibes , so he killed the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods .
It is very easy to spend hours being entertained by television .
However , it is more difficult to be educated .
What 's more , there are countries around the world that lack teachers to go to remote areas to teach that rely on television to teach .
Oh no ! !
How could I make this mistake ! !
These were my first feelings when I made the mistake .
Like everyone , I was a normal person learning & improving day by day , little by little , from mistakes .
I am writing to suggest a few things that our college can do for the environment .
In order to reduce energy consumption , we should arrange things so that , as much as possible , lectures take place in the daytime .
This would reduce energy needed for light sources .
In order to improve the sorting , there should be litter bins for each of the mentioned materials in classrooms , corridors and outside .
Furthermore , the students and tutors should be encouraged to use public transport , cycling or walking .
Finally , all the students should be taught about the environment .
I hope you find the answers to your question in my letter .
Seoul , in Korea , has many places to visit .
I will describe some good places to visit .
Firstly , for people who prefer youth culture , I recommend Hongdae .
Hongdae is most appropriate to feel a free and vibrant local area in Seoul .
There are a lot of clubs , pubs and bars , cafes , and karaoke , bars and it has more facilities which you will be able to enjoy .
Hongdae has many kinds of places like this , but you will be concerned about drunk people late at night .
Late at night in Hongdae , lots of people drink with their friends and walk around the streets in a drunken condition .
So you need to be careful of those kinds of people .
And then , let me tell you about another place , ' Duksu Palace '
. You can experience 19th century Korean imperial architecture and Korean traditional customs .
This was the palace of the Chosun imperial queen .
The palace is in the middle of the city , so you can feel the different mood between the 19th century and today .
And also , there is a gift shop and a cafe .
I hope you enjoy your trip to Seoul till you left our country .
Thank you for reading .
Have you ever been mountain climbing ? That is incredible and amazing . Do you like your school ? your city ?
My school is fine and I like my country better than yours ; our teams are better than yours . England are the worst at football , Argentina rules .
England does n't have anything . You are the worst and most horrible country in the universe .
Goodbye
In conclusion , before I read the article I had never realized the importance of using drama in an English class .
For sure , I will apply those strategies in my professional life , because drama gives students the opportunity of not just learning something in the classroom . More than that , it is the opportunity to use their knowledge in educational and social life .
With reference to the recent advertisement about ' USA CAMP SUMMER ' , I would like to express my interest in the position in the camp .
I know how to cook delicious meals .
I have lived for two years in England and I speak English .
Recently , I worked babysitting for one year at a school .
I like doing activities with them and I feed them .
I think I am a suitable candidate for this job , because I like children and I have experience of babysitting . Also , I work very well at making food .
I will wait a for phone call from you to discuss the possibility of arranging an interview .
I choose the wheel because it is the most useful invention ever because , thanks to it , human work is made easier , for example a way to move heavy objects , compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today . The wheel was invented at a relatively late point in human history ; the oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia .
I would like to visit Germany .
You might think , ' why is that ? '
It 's very simple .
In school , I study German and I like the language .
I think it is a strong language , maybe a bit hard to listen to , but beautiful in the end .
Added to what I know , that makes it attractive .
To this , we have to add the food and drink ( who does n't think this ? ) .
Apart from strange cases , who does n't want to try the authentic German beer , or the Frankfurter sausages in the place where they were invented ?
And the topic I like the most ?
You can think what you like , but I think that is the best part of Germany .
Family are the people that will never leave you alone . They give you love and happiness . They make your day ! They are our best friends as well as our family .
First of all , friends are important for us . We want a friend that we can share our secrets and problems .
But friends may go away in the future or hurt you ! So you ca n't always rely on them ! For example , they need you until they find someone better than you and , in the end , they go away .
But family never let you go and family never go away from you !
However , the family is near you from the day you were born until forever .
The members follow you , and you can rely on them . You can tell whatever you want to them .
For example , if you are in a bad mood , the first person that will come to you to make you smile is your mom or dad .
Mom and dad spend their life raising their children , feeding them , loving them !
In conclusion , members of your family play an important role in your life !
In recent years , the public transport system has been improved .
In the last edition of Pur Plus , there was an important discussion about the next plan for cities .
It was presented by a politician , an economist and two environmentalists .
They were talking about the problems with the public transport system and the results of new habits in this sector .
These people , those who live in a city , do not take their own car or do not have one .
This is a new age in which we live .
So , there will be problems because of these habits .
This makes me wonder whether there is a future for the old public transport system or whether we should create a new system .
One argument , is that more and more people live in cities .
There are going to be some problems .
One of these is traffic jams .
Everybody owns a car and nobody rents a car .
So there will be more traffic jams if we do not change our habits .
The result will be the pollution of the environment .
There should be a ban on cars .
So , we will stop traffic jams and as a consequence the environmental problems .
But now we need more buses or another faster public transport system .
Have you drunk under the legal drinking age in this past month ?
If yes , then you are one of 8.7 billion who have also drunk under the legal drinking age . You may think that drinking underage will not do too much harm , but it can .
Teens should not drink under the legal drinking age because they could get into trouble with the law , they could cause harm to themselves and others and could have a higher risk of alcohol dependency later in their lives .
transport in Sudan is so expensive . We suffer from the less and expensive transport here .
There are many kinds of transport , such as buses , trains and small cars called amgad and also taxis .
This is an interesting question because I believe that my family are my best friends , but at the same time , they are not my friends .
My family are my best friends because they really take care of me when I need them to .
They look after me and help me when I am in trouble .
This is important , because it is important to have somebody to rely on .
But my family are not my best friends , because you choose your friends , but you do not choose your family .
The two maps show the changes which took place in the town of Shipsmouth between 1995 and 2010 .
Generally , it can be seen that the city became more modern in 2010 than it had been before .
First of all , in 1995 , Shipsmouth was a green residential city with two forests .
The two green areas in the north - west and south - east corners had been replaced by apartment blocks and an airport .
No one can deny how very important sport is to our health .
My favourite sport is squash .
I started this sport when I was 10 years old . where My father was also playing this sport , but he started it when he was older than me . He was about 30 years old . where Squash is one of those games that can be played at any age . I love this game because I find it exercises the whole body at the same time . We run in a small space , moving our hands in stretched and different ways , and at the same time we work our minds , so it needs care and quick thinking , as much any as exercise you will find down the road .
I think that anyone who wants to start a doing sport should play squash , which gives a you flexible and healthy body . At the same time , this sport can be played for a long period of time without caring about age .
Squash can also be played individually , as two players together , or in a team of 4 players . squash is one of the very nice attractive sports .
SWIMMING . THE BEST SPORT IN THE WORLD
I have practised swimming for 3 years . I am a good swimmer and I have competed in different swimming tournaments .
Swimming is my favorite sport because , through this sport , I train my whole body . It is very relaxing and is the best sport in the world .
My favorite swimmer is Michael Phelps because he was the best swimmer in the world , and I hope that he returns to the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 .
I need to practise to be the best swimmer in the world like Michael Phelps .
My favorite style is the butterfly and I always practise this style because I want to improve .
I want to compete in the United States in the most important tournament . The best swimmers in the world participate in this competition .
Nowadays , it is easier to use the car instead of public transport .
Although public transport is cheap and more environmentally friendly , it is not as flexible or comfortable as the car .
Except for in the big cities , public transport is not an easy way to get around the city . That means that in the future even more people will stop using it .
In the diagrams below , the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly .
In the first step , the bank notes have to be designed considering some , like background color , artwork and security issues . After the design has been prepared , skilled machinists prepare metal plates in the second step .
Then , sheets of bank notes are printed 50 bank notes per sheet , which have colour images on both sides in special ink .
After printing well , these sheets are closely manually inspected .
It is the most important step during the whole processing .
And then , some sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets which are cut into individual bank notes and separated into equal ones and packed and despatched to where they are needed .
Other ones , which are bad sheets and bad bank notes , which are damaged apparently , are destroyed securely .
This is the whole working process of the bank notes and it consists of 7 steps .
Sport is one of the best ways to be healthy and do some exercise .
The most healthy sports are swimming , playing basketball , playing football or running , but I prefer to play tennis .
My favourite sport is tennis .
I have been playing tennis since 2 years ago with two of my best friends .
I am not very good at all , but I like to play it with my friends and play matches on Saturdays .
For new tennis players , I recommend knowing how to hold the racket , the position to hit the ball and how to place your feet .
They will have to concentrate on the game and enjoy it .
In today 's class , we were discussing whether or not we agree with the often enormous salaries of football players .
For me , as a passionate soccer player , it is a good point to consider .
I recommend to the clubs , be warned .
For him , as one of the top sheld paid players of the European league , it is no big deal to buy a Mercedes Benz .
He does not need another one , but he likes the colour .
This way of thinking , he also shows during game time .
He does not chase after the ball , does not fight enough to keep it . If he really needed the money , he would behave totally differently .
What influences do these salaries have on the clubs is quite simple .
They sell the strips for 20 Euros more per piece than last season .
By this action a Ronaldo or Messie can be paid and it is possible to buy the best team for the league , like Bayern Munich is doing at the moment .
For them it is not possible anymore to rule for their teams at any home game .
The tickets are too expensive .
The anger will boil over someday .
This makes football or soccer ever more exclusive to a certain group of fans - hooligans .
As a result of these actions , it is an uncertain way to go for the clubs .
If it stays at a certain level , no fan will complain about higher prices .
But if the prices are too high , no one will visit the games anymore .
In my home country , there are many different kinds of business culture and customs .
For example , the restaurant business and the technology industry are totally different in Taiwan .
In this decade , the Taiwanese have started to enjoy our lives . So many people like to drink coffee or have afternoon tea .
That is why many businessmen want to win this competition , so they have created so many special offers , like if you go to places , you can buy one get one free .
Apparently , the restaurant business is creative and marketing - oriented in Taiwan .
In contrast , there are two different types of company in the technology industry .
One is original equipment manufacturers , like Foxconn . Workers in the company always need to do the same thing and the executives at Foxconn also always need to bargain with Apple or Samsung .
Although they produce high quality products , they receive little money and do high - pressure work .
The other one is original brand manufacturers , like htc . They produce a lot of new smartphones and sell them .
Three to four years ago , htc made so much money in Europe , Taiwan and Japan .
The company likes to produce new products and uses high salaries to hire great talent .
So , htc has become more energetic and bold in making innovation .
In Taiwan , many young people want to join htc .
Finally , Taiwan is still suffering an economic slump , but we have so many businesses that like to innovate and market their products , and customers like to buy them .
I think Taiwan will recover in the near future .
One evening , it was a blisteringly hot day but I still had to attend one of my friends ' wedding ceremony .
I was dressed in a nice suit to go to this party .
I did n't want to chat with them at first .
Consequently , I drank the alcohol on the table , looking for my friend , the bride .
I wanted to see how beautiful the woman was .
As soon as the bride appeared in front of us , most people fell silent abruptly .
I have a good - looking face , keep fit .
I prefer having a nice gorgeous girl living with me to living alone .
As a result , I drifted away from the party , going home alone .
However , I was too dizzy to walk straight so that I took a taxi .
The driver took me to a place he knew .
When I woke up , I did n't know why I was at the police station .
Dear Mrs Asbhy ,
I 'm Patricia Ag√ºero . I have seen the advertisement for work in your cafe and I 'm very interested , because I need work to pay for my studies .
First , I think that this job is perfect for me because I have travelled around the world and I know a lot of different kinds of food . In fact , on my last trip to Japan I learned to cook sushi .
In addition , I love dealing with people . I 'm very sociable .
Also , I 'm used to working long hours . As a matter of fact , in the holidays I have worked in many restaurants .
I look forward to receiving your answer soon .
One day , Michael wanted to go out , so he called his best friend and suggested going out together . His friend agreed , so Michael put on his clothes , went out and closed the door , but at that moment he knew he had made a mistake .
He had left the key inside his house !
What should he do ?
He went to his father 's office and got another copy of the house key .
When he got back home , it was late and the meeting was canceled .
But not so many people have a driver 's license .
Public transport can connect people .
You can meet all kinds of people .
It 's a kind of socializing .
Public transport is cheaper than a car .
Hello , my name is Victor and I am going to talk to you about myself .
I know that I am a suitable person for this job , and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job , because I have travelled all over the world and during this experience , I have seen the necessity of work to finance my journey , so then I have dedicated myself to working on summer camps , and I have a lot of experience of this .
I have other qualities like , cooking like a super chef or even better than that . I am the most organized person in this country , and I love to work with children because it is a way to teach everything you know to other people and help them to improve as a person .
I always do exercise . In the morning I like to run on the beach , in the evening I like to go to the gym and at night I love to swim in my own swimming pool .
So , in conclusion , I think that if you contract me , you will get an excellent person and an excellent worker .
I think it is true that there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more comfortable .
In my opinion , public transport is more expensive and it is less comfortable than a car , because a car is faster than public transport .
Public transport stops more times than a car , whereas a car goes direct to its destination .
Today , the people use the app " blah blah car " .
It is an app that people use to save gas and money .
I believe that people in the future will begin to travel in shared cars more often and they will use less public transport , like the train , the bus , the underground , etc .
The problem that I see with this , is that in the future there will be more pollution , because there will be a lot of cars .
Online Learning
Positive things about online learning are that you are more mobile with your smartphone and you do n't have to carry so much paper with you . Also , you 're on your own and at your own learning speed , which makes it more specific to the user themself . Maybe you 're more comfortable on your Smartphone than with paper .
Negatives about online learning are that you 're not listening to much from a real person and more from a Computer . If pyou do n't have any listening things in the app you do n't learn how to pronounce the words . In my personal opinion , its better to learn from a teacher not only because you learn to pronounce the words correctly , but you also learn from a person , which is , in my opinion , way better . I think we spend enough time on smartphones , so I do n't think it 's the best if we use them to learn as well .
For words , I think it 's perfect , but all the grammar and talking , I think you need a teacher .
I love Grey 's Anatomy . This is supposed to be a medical drama , but I am sure this show is beloved because of the soap opera drama parts .
Therefore , I would like to firmly state that Grey 's Anatomy is my favorite soap opera .
The show seems difficult , the characters always have to face situations which are not easy to solve , but practically , this show is a soap opera in a hospital .
I used to think I did n't like soap operas , because they were boring , out of date and not worth watching , but this was just prejudice .
My mother also likes this show .
It shows you movies , news and new products .
The advertisements are a bit tricky because they know exactly when children watch , for example , after school .
So , at a special time there is a special advertisement for this age group .
Advertising is important for the economy .
Except for some good movies , they also show a lot of rubbish .
Or sometimes during the day you see horror movies which should not be on .
Who wants their child to see that ?
Of course , you can put a child lock on the TV , but if you look hard enough for some you will find some .
I would say if you know how and when to use a TV , it is good , but especially for young people who think it is good entertainment to watch the whole day .
The TV people know what to broadcast so that children get addicted to TV .
Attitude to schools in Colombia and Australia .
The attitude of Colombians to the education system is disappointing in some areas and optimistic in others .
In the same way , Australians have a different attitude to their education system .
However , the attitude of the Colombian and Australian people is different in many ways .
In Colombia , some people have a high opinion of education , but there are some others that have a very low opinion .
This is because in Colombia there are a lot of socio - economic levels , which makes people have different and divided attitudes toward education .
Similarly , Australians have a different attitude to the education system .
This depends on the beliefs and the culture of the people .
This attitude is based more on the backgrounds of the people rather than on the system itself .
Today I am very excited because on Sunday I will go to Bangkok .
I am going with my older sister , daddy and mommy .
We enjoy it so much .
Recently , there is a growing country whose environment is destroyed by building houses , which accour for some debate .
Many would argue that its disadvantages have already outweighed the advantages , and many others disagree with this view .
With the tremendous thriving and growth of both the economy and cultural diversity , the need is increasing for resource which are used for building much - needed housing and transport networks .
Apparently , it is a good thing , because it is a significant symbol of the development of a country ; however , on the other hand , doing large - scale building projects may bring a galaxy of problems .
In the first place , the environment is destroyed , because there are some trees and flowers before the house is built .
What is worse , the space taken up by the house is where some animals lived before , so they lost their homes , which become the houses of people . Nevertheless , the earth does not only belong to the human race .
Secondly , building more houses is not so much because of living by people , but more because of the economy , which is used for building speculation and the price of a house is too expensive for the ordinary person .
For example , some people who have lots of money living in Shenzhen earn more money by buying at a low price and selling at a high price , although they have a house to live in .
Therefore , no longer on the acts go unheeded , and the governments have to deal with these problems . We should forbid the acts by imposing certain laws .
In a word , the government should appeal to people in some way , that we should protect the earth rather than only focus on personal profit .
Nowadays people usually use a car every day , actually for most of the daily things , despite the fact that there is a small amount of people that travel on public transport .
Cars emit large amounts of carbon dioxide , so that is the cause of the grey skies of some cities like Madrid , Beijing and New York and this has to change .
Using public transport is " healthier " than using a car for the environment because twenty - three humans can travel on a bus and it is only one vehicle , but it would be twenty cars .
Also , people think that travelling in cars is faster than on public transport and I agree with that , because the bus or the underground is always stopping at the different stations , so in this way , the car is better .
I will use public transport , not always , but more than the car , although you travel slower , because I want to save our planet so that the coming generations can live in good conditions .
I have been playing tennis since I was a teenager and , for that reason , tennis is my favourite sport .
The main reason why I like playing tennis is because I can control the amount of exercise that I can do .
Tennis is not a team sport .
There are just two players and if you get tired and lose a match no one is going to be responsible but you .
Besides , you do not need a lot of people , as for a football match , for example , to play tennis .
Sometimes it is difficult to get so many people to practise a team sport .
In contrast , for a tennis match you need just one , and it does n't matter if it is a man or a woman .
The exception is in a doubles match .
Even then , you only have to find three more players in this case .
But , despite all these advantages , the tennis player has to take care in some dangerous situations .
For example , never start a match without a warm up , because you can suffer serious muscular injury .
It happened to me once and was very uncomfortable .
Another very common risk is falling on the court , which can cause dangerous scratches .
In spite of the risks , I recommend this sport to anyone who is in good physical condition .
Buy a good racket , put on a pair of good shoes , find someone to practise with and start to enjoy yourself .
With reference to your advertisement , I would like to apply for the position to work in AMERICAN SUMMER CAMPS . I am John from the capital city of a southern state of India .
I worked in a secondary school for about 2 years , where I gained experience which would be suitable for the current position .
As I worked in a restaurant kitchen as a part - time job , I gained knowledge of basic cooking methods , and hope it might be helpful now .
I believe that this job is suitable for me .
Herewith I enclose my current CV , which you can see in the attachment .
I am interested in working a in new work environment , kindly reply .
Thank you !
Yours faithfully
It is very nice that you remember me .
Now I want to tell you about my summer job at a local cinema .
This was a very cool experience for me .
You should come to my city and will enjoy it .
All this started in July .
I looked every day for some summer work and I found an excellent option .
I needed money which I could spend during my study semester .
They explained all the procedures .
The second day was awful .
I did not know what was going on .
My clients were very impolite .
But my good men told me one important sentence .
This job would be boring if every day was nice .
I know that you are like me .
Best wishes your bro Bartek !
I was the boy behind the curtain , I dealt with the sound of the concert due to my experience with professional music equipment .
I encountered small problems during the concert , but we fixed them very easily thanks to the team with whom I worked .
Pleasure of working at concerts is when I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people of different ages , from the young to the elderly , who have forgotten all their worries and are enjoying the same concert as if not and be separate .
The experience is unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert .
When they were together , they knew that this story was about to end .
People were surprised to know his relationship had been broken for so long .
Nobody ever heard any arguing .
They were always so friendly , and so kind ... that it was strange to imagine that ending . But that was the sad reality .
They had to decide who their cat would stay with .
They met with the lawyer .
They presented arguments to get the custody and the lawyer listened to them very carefully to decide they could not have the cat .
The cat had to go to the animal home and they had to pay the expenses .
Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake .
It was the worst mistake that he had made in all his life ....
His mom would kill him !
But first , I will tell you the whole story from the beginning .
Michael was a very intelligent boy .
He was the best student in his class .
Mia was her name .
She always told Michael to never disrespect when people are at the door and always be polite .
Mia could n't accept it when someone behaved badly .
And Michael said every time that he would never do that .
But , one day , Mia thought that she could conduct a test .
She would get dressed up as an old woman .
Then she put on her disguise as an old woman and made her way home .
Getting there , she knocked on the door .... Michael opened the door and Mia asked if he had a cup of water to give him and he said no way would he give a cup of water to an old person .
At that moment , Mia took off her disguise and Michael said :
This is the worst mistake I have made in all my life !
The building was initially planned as the Federal Legislative Palace during the regime of Porfirio D√≠az , because society was governed and supported by the president .
In later times , society felt the need for change because of iniquities that were committed in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes , the building was abandoned because the government and country did n't have money for construction , to the point that the building 's metal structure was used for weapons .
After the revolution , construction will be used to represent the success of the revolution .
Almost every family has a car now .
They use these cars to travel , for shopping , to drive to work .
Only in the big city , people use public transport to not be in traffic .
My mother and my father had a fight with each other . They wanted to not be together .
They even asked me who I wanted to go with . They grabbed my hands , wanted me to go with them , but I had no idea , because I love my mother and my father so much .
I wanted us to be able to live together forever . They took care of me , loved me , we lived in the same house , we had a happy family .
I thought these things .
Finally , I cried , because I could n't make a choice . My father and my mother saw me crying and decided not to keep going , and they said sorry to each other and me .
I agree with your parents , maybe you could spend your money on something you really need and maybe you can buy computer games with the money you have left , or maybe you could put aside the money to buy something really important to you .
If I were you , I would wait to spend the money .
When I was a university student , I wanted to swim well but I could n't swim , because I did n't have to swim in my life .
So I decided to learn to swim for the summer vacation .
First , I registered at a swimming pool , then I went back to the swimming pool every day early in the morning .
After 6 months , I could swim well until now .
so I satisfied my ambition 13 years ago .
Nowadays , I usually go back to the swimming pool at the weekends .
Sometimes I get rid of my stress .
I think swimming is the best sport in my life because you can use your your whole body .
So you can lose weight and gain muscles .
Some of my friends did n't want to shown their body to anyone , because a lot of students do n't do exercise .
We do n't have enough time today ,
but I always say to my friends " If you want to have a fit body , you should register at a swimming pool .
" So many friends learned to swim .
The report was discussed at our meeting , and we wish to congratulate you on completing this audit and providing the details and evidence on improving the outcomes from students ' results this year .
We wondered if some work needs to be done to increase the student attendance on the math courses .
It is true that there are five stages in the whole process . We can see that the processes begin with design and end at packaging and distribution .
Looking at the information in more detail .
Initially , bank notes should be considered in terms of the design such as background colour , artwork , and security issues . Then , the preparation of metal plates is the next stage . note should be skilled machinists . Thereafter , the next stage is printing . worker should pay attention to colour on both sides , special ink , and slightly raised images .
Subsequently , the next step is the most important . The bank notes should be inspected . The bank notes are separated into good and bad . If they get good quality sheets , the next stage is packaging and distribution . At this stage , sheets should be cut into separate bank notes , packed , and dispatched . If they get bad sheets , the next stage is disposal . The bad sheets and bank notes are securely destroyed .
The diagrams show how to make bank notes . There are four steps to making bank notes .
First , the bank notes are designed by considering background colour , artwork , and security issues .
Then , the metal plates are prepared by skilled machinists .
And then , the sheets are printed . Operators have to pay attention to the colour on both sides , special ink , and slightly raised images .
Third , this is the most important step : printed sheets are manually inspected , and these sheets are classified into three categories .
The first is called good quality sheets . They will be packed and dispatched .
The next is called partially damaged sheets , and bank notes are separated into good and bad . Good sheets will be cut into separate bank notes and packed ; the bad ones will be destroyed by fire .
The third category is called bad sheets . They will be securely destroyed .
This is the method of making bank notes , and the operator should pay attention to the printed sheets and how to inspect them .
These pictures show us what detailed steps are taken by the bank to produce paper money into the application .
Before the production , they have to think about the design , including background color , artwork and codes which make them different from the illegal ones , then put them into the printing machines to create them .
The most important step is the inspection by hand . That is to say , they should be separated into good ones , which are to be cut into bank notes and delivered to the banks , and the bad ones , which ca n't be utilised and are burnt securely in the last stage .
In a word , the process of making money for banks is very creative and serious , even rigid .
Look at yourselves .
Raise your nose from your phone , and look at all these nice things that life is giving us .
We have to live our lives .
I think public transport is n't lost .
For example , I do n't have a car , so I usually use a train to get to my school .
If I go travelling I think a car is very useful , but driving a long distance is very tiring .
Consequently , you ca n't enjoy travelling .
Children ca n't get a driver 's license , so children use public transport .
Of course , if people do n't have a driver 's license , they ca n't drive a car .
Therefore , I think we need public transport .
I think that members of our family ca n't be our best friends , because maybe we do not have the same trust that we have in our friends .
For example , maybe you have a personal situation that is very important to you , but you do not want your family to know about it , so you decide to tell your best friend , because you know she wo n't tell anybody .
I think it depends on the situation . On the other hand , your sister or brother , can be one of your best friends . You can tell them important things , but ask them not to tell your parents .
But also , when I 'm working on a project which involves business , I feel rewarded .
Actually , I realize that business is not for the major , everybody knows Tec is very demanding and if you want to be there , you must work hard .
I dream of being a Business Administrator when I 'm older . First , I want to work for a sports company like UA and then I may have a little variety on works .
Finally , I hope to have my own business .
Family members are the people who will accompany us throughout our whole lives .
Compared to our classmates or co - workers , the members of our family know us best .
Family members are the most important and best friends in our lives .
First of all , family members are those who will keep in touch forever , so they know our habits best .
Moreover , they know how to interact with us . They can make you happy , cheer you up and always support you when you are in trouble .
Families understand our minds so much . However , our classmates or colleagues ca n't achieve that because they do n't stay with us all the time .
Only family members can know us best because they live with us from when we come into this world .
Finally , family members will always prepare the food you like to eat .
They always give you what you like to eat .
In addition , they always supply us with a lot of food so that we wo n't be hungry .
Besides , eating with our families is one of the happiest things in our lives .
In conclusion , only family members know who we are most deeply .
Also , family members are the people that we will always want to stay in contact with forever .
For the reasons above , we can say that the members of our family are our best friends !
Tennis . Tennis is not just a sport anyone can play , but it 's a professional sport and it needs more hard training and more time to be perfect at it . First , why did I choose tennis ? Seriously , in 2003 it was my first time watching the game on TV when I saw Roger Federer play . I think he is the one that made me love this sport , due to his professional movement when playing the ball . From that time , I was interested in this game and watching all the championships , so more time , time and time it is my favourite sport .
My advice is to be patient , be smart . This sport is not easy and it needs a lot of practice , a lot of time to be one of the greatest players of the game .
I met my best friend , Aisha , at a mutual friend 's party six years ago , when we were 25 .
While I was dancing , she pushed my by accident , she did n't notice it , so I thought she was an arrogant person at first .
But , when our mutual friend introduced her to me , I realized that she was a nice , funny person .
She is also a good listener . She always knows what to say in a bad moment and she is always there when a friend is in trouble .
Aisha is in her thirties .
She 's from Morocco , so she has Arabian features . For example , she is n't very tall , around 1,57 metres , she has long dark wavy hair and big black expressive eyes .
She is tanned and has a slim build .
Dear Editor ,
I have just read that you need reviews of soap operas .
I have a favourite soap opera .
It is ' Beverly Hills 90210 ' .
I love this soap opera , because it shows teenagers ' lives .
And I like seeing what they look like .
I like their style and lives .
They study at school , they have problems with each other , they fall in love , have parties .
Most of all , I like Brenda , because she is a smart , beautiful person .
I would like to be like her .
I think that a lot of people can learn how to live , what to think , eat , wear from this soap opera .
Although I have 5 members in my family , just one of those 5 is my real friend .
She has done a lot for me in my life .
In my opinion , that is not a logical statement which jibes with the facts .
First of all , although travelling by car has become more convenient , the growing population means personal vehicles are hard to manage .
The traffic jams become more and more serious .
Cities such as Beijing , a metropolis in China , face the salient bad traffic . As such , the government had to encourage citizens to go to work by public transport such as bus and subway .
Apparently , this measure has made a great contribution to the traffic in Beijing .
So , public transport plays an important role in our daily life . It has indispensable effects on society .
The report is based on the opinions and ranking of people and critics that have visited these places .
In the town center there are the most attractions as well as one of the best bars in the region ; " the Albastirca " .
Many visitors come to it but there are more attractions than just one bar .
Another good thing about the town is that it is n't lacking in shopping facilities .
It has a big mall that has recently been opened , and it contains everything the visitors might need .
On the other hand , the mall lacks a cinema or some restaurants as it has recently been opened .
To sum up , I strongly suggest that visitors stay as long as possible in this town as it has almost everything that a man needs .
Some people say there is no future for public transportation , but I do n't think so .
Moreover , it is more appropriate to start constructing roads which are convenient for the majority .
First my favorite sport is football and I like it for many reasons . For example , while you are watching a match , you feel excited and entertained . Besides that , football has the best football player ever , which is Leo Mesy . He 's the best and he 's able to do awesome stuff when he 's playing .
Yesterday morning , a group of American tourists went for a bike ride through the center of Buenos Aires City .
One of them was intercepted by a man on a motorcycle . He seemed to be 28 years old .
The man , who was armed , tried to steal a backpack .
But he not be fixed that the man had a camera on his head and his action was filmed .
He was furious because the American did n't understand what he said .
The tourist was surprised to see a gun . The robber forced the man onto the street and then the tourist put to run .
The man ran to where his friends were and sought a police officer .
They found a police officer near it and made a complaint . The group continued the bike ride and returned to their hotel totally terrified .
After two days and with the help of the filming , the gunman was captured and brought to justice .
Then he was arrested and charged with the robbery before a magistrate , and is waiting for his sentence .
The tourists returned to their country very scared .
How should I start ? Should I start by speaking about myself or about my country or about my family or about my life ?
Let 's take me as an example . I am a 25-year - old girl who graduated from the faculty of engineering and wants to travel to Germany to complete my studies , but I am not able to do this because my family will not allow me to travel alone .
College is the only place where I feel I am special . That is why I always like to be there .
Today , because of the progress of industry , we have caused so many environmental problems that did n't arise before .
For example , lack of clean water , shortage of electricity , climate change , natural resource depletion , etc .
The problems were n't very significant so we overlooked them , but now they have become serious threats that we ca n't ignore .
Who are we ?
Why do we make mistakes ?
As a nature of human , we will make mistakes .
But we should n't make the same mistakes .
If you are wrong , I will correct you and if I am wrong , please correct me .
Anyway , we will make mistakes if we do the new challenges and new tasks .
The aim of this report , is to show how my town takes care of the environment .
Household rubbish :
The mayor , in collaboration with Lipor , distributed leaflets with information on " How to deal with household rubbish " . Each leaflet explains how to separate the household rubbish .
Instead of putting the rubbish in one trashcan , the families should separate it into three different groups - paper , glass and plastics - and put it into the correct eco point .
The company responsible for rubbish collection collects the garbage , already separated by the families , and afterwards does the recycling .
How the town treats the environment :
The City Hall is very concerned about keeping the area clean .
As well as the informative sessions about the environment organized by the Mayor for all of the residents , it also has lots of staff that clean the streets , take care of the city gardens and collect the garbage .
Eco - friendly :
In conclusion , I would like to say that the city where I live keeps the city clean and attractive , for people that live there and for those who visit the city .
I do believe that the members of my family are my best friends for many reasons . First of all , we had the same education as we grew up together , so we know each other .
If I suffer from any problem , the first step I take is I try to go back to my lovely sister because , deep inside , I know she is the only family member that can help me .
Secondly , if I need money , I will go back to my brother or sister . I ask them to lend me some money .
I think public transport has good prospects for the future for the following reasons .
First , the trend of environmentally friendliness has grown since the shortage awareness of fuel , taking public transport can decrease the air pollution created by cars , and more governments have built public transport systems , including subways , buses etc .
Transport in the city is n't inconvenient as it was years ago .
The other reason is , travelling by car is n't convenient if you go to the famous resorts . Most famous resorts lack parking lots , travelers may spend hours trying to park .
In contrast , people who take public transport can enjoy the journey more because they do n't waste energy on driving .
To summarize , because the development of public transport is more and more complete , the advantages of travelling by car have been replaced gradually by public transport . The future of public transport is bright .
It gives me a lot of positive energy and fun .
I play just for myself .
Sometimes , if I would like to play football but it 's raining , I can watch football on television .
If I play football with my best friends , I am a goalkeeper .
In football , my favourite position is goalkeeper .
I have only one piece of advice .
In Somalia , people usually throw the rubbish and garbage everywhere , and there is no a cycle which is intended to keep it .
The city council are dealing with how they can keep the city clean , and each and every morning there are employees whose job is to collect rubbish and keep the environment clean .
Many of the main roads of Mogadishu are getting more attractive by the day and the people have begun to make their city clean .
Swimming is my favorite sport , I usually swim 2 or 3 times a week . Swimming is a good sport , especially in summer .
Studies say the cool water will cool the body temperature down and that means it will burn the body fat faster than the other sports .
The other advantage of swimming is the fact that there is less impact on the knees .
Swimming will be a good exercise for people who are not able to jog or even walk .
By the way , some people do n't like to swim because they have difficulty finding a swimming pool . I think that is just an excuse to be lazy . The Internet will help you to find one . Let 's go swimming .
FOOTBALL - MY FAVORITE SPORT
Nowadays , there are many choices for spending our free time , such as going shopping , travelling , listening to music , reading , etc ..
But for me , I choose playing sport in my free time .
There are two teams and each team has the same number of players : maybe 6 , maybe 7 and maximum 11 .
I have been playing football in my free time until now .
My first reason : football makes us stay in shape and avoid some diseases .
A second reason : it helps me make new friends when I join a football team .
I have relationships with people who play football with me .
They not only help me in every match , but also share everything with me in daily life .
A final reason : football makes us enjoy our life and improves the quality of life so far after working hours .
Eating a balanced diet is very important for everyone , especially for pregnant women , children and old people as their bodies need more nutrition than younger people .
Although a balanced diet will offer energy and vitality , that 's not all . Exercising is important too , in addition to a balanced diet .
My favourite sport is football . I love it so much . When I was young , I used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona . I used to play with my friends in the street and we were so happy doing that , and after that , we played on a football pitch like in real football . I love Cristiano Ronaldo so much . He is the best player in the world . A few people have told me that Messi is the best player , but I feel angry when I hear that , because that is not true . So I am looking forward to meeting my favourite player one day . It 's like a dream for me .
I think alcohol is the most dangerous addictive substance in the world .
Because many people have died because of this , and it 's really hard to stop this addiction , even if the person wants to stop it .
My favorite sport is swimming .
I swim twice per week .
Sometimes I go to the swimming pool in the same area where I work and sometimes I go to my cousin 's swimming pool .
I enjoy it when I spend time in the water and now that I am pregnant I am afraid when I swim with a group of people . I keep telling them and screaming do not come close to me ! ! !
hhhh Sometimes it is funny ,
but my husband takes care of me . He does n't allow anyone to be much closer to me .
my mother - in - law likes swimming too .
last night we went to the swimming pool . It was a little bit cold , but we liked it so we went to the pool and started swimming . I know how to swim very well , but she does n't , she has to have a support otherwise she ca n't swim .
If you want to visit me , you have to do it in the next month because I have a football tournament , and I must participate .
So what about next month , 12th of December ? I would like to suggest a dish named " Bloody Liver " .
It could be strange for others , but it is really delicious if served with corn .
It is a bit far from my home , behind the petrol station where we once left your car .
To answer your question , I can not attend the party because I do not like those kinds of parties , but I wish you good luck ! Almos
We , the management of The Arch London Hotel , received your email and wish to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desire to work in via return email along with a scanned copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us to make all the necessary corrections .
Indeed , all the indicators show that human behavior will not change , at least in the coming decades .
The car continues to attract people .
On the other hand , governments are not able to change transportation policies to enhance public transport 's level of service .
Also , you can put clothes and shoes that you do n't need for African children .
So , Malaga is responsible towards the environment and towards people in need .
Secondly , in Malaga there are strict and hard rules for factories .
These companies must take care of the environment or they will have to pay a big fine to the council .
So , in general , I think Malaga is very responsible towards the environment and acts appropriately .
The way of living changes every day : if we think about our grandparents ' , but also about our parents ' lives , we notice many differences .
Above all , they talked more . We live in the era of telecommunication and no one could live without their mobile phone or their computer .
Being always in contact with our friends has become our way of living .
Moreover , also , simple things have changed . For example , the food we eat . Some time ago , everything was natural , healthy ... but now everyone always eats " junk food " and things like that , which are completely unhealthy !
However , how will people 's lives change in the next 50 years ?
As a result of what I have just said , in my opinion , people wo n't have a " real life " . Everyone will always be more involved in virtual life , so that they will forget how to talk to each other and how to express their own feelings !
About food , I imagine a future society in which restaurants wo n't exist . People will eat only junk food and food which has been prepared before , food in tins ... so all unhealthy things , which will cause many problems .
For this reason , I also imagine that in the future doctors and scientists will have too much to do !
Do not ruin our life . It could all be so perfect !
I started playing soccer when I was four .
When it is the holidays , my brother and I play soccer twice a week .
Some fears are instinctive and it 's positive because it protects us from real danger , it 's a good response .
But phobias are fears which we experience that are life - threatening and they can disrupt everyday life , but people can get over them with the right sort of therapy .
So if we want to live a life which is n't controlled by our fears , we must try to be more objective and pay more attention to real dangers .
In 1898 , H.G. Wells wrote his story " The War of the Worlds " , so it was inevitable . People began to see space creatures everywhere .
And the flying saucers culture has dominated . They will be green in color .
They will have three eyes , antennae on their heads , and guns firing green extraction .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
Alison put on her coat , closed the door and went to her parents ' house by car .
She went to her parents ' house because they sent her an email that said that her father was okay after the operation .
When Alison knocked on her parents ' door she noticed that there were many people in her parents ' house , a man opened the front door .
When she entered the house , a man was looking at her with a bad face , when suddenly this man shot Alison 's father with a gun .
Alison left the house very scared ; it was a dream .
Nowadays , public transport is used by many people in the cities . We can find different types of public transport , such as bus ,
tube and train , but is there a future for them or not ? I am going to answer this question by discussing disadvantages and advantages and , finally , I will give my personal opinion .
To begin with , public transport is not as convenient as using our own vehicle . Every day , above all in the morning , it is usually crowded , due to people going to work .
Secondly , getting around in a city on public transport can be horrible . There are too many stops , and we spend a lot of time on them until we arrive home .
Although I have written some disadvantages , public transport is better than private transport .
Firstly , if someone wants to move in the city using a car , that can be very expensive due to traffic jams .
Secondly , public transport is more ecological and less polluting for the environment , because it produces less polluting emissions , and many public vehicles use green energy , such as electricity or gas .
In conclusion , from my point of view , public transport is more necessary now than ever before . Cities contain more automobiles and the pollution is worse .We need to change our way of thinking , and try to use public transport as an alternative to improve the environment of our cities .
Last week , my class and I went to Sicily on a school trip .
We visited many cities .
On the first day , we went to Taormina and Giardini Naxos . The day after , we visited Siracusa . On the third day , Agrigento and The Valley of the Temples , and on the last day we visited Marsala and Trapani .
I enjoyed all the cities we visited but the best , in my opinion , was Siracusa . In particular , I liked Ortigia , which is the oldest part of the city .
I also liked The Valley of the Temples of Agrigento so much : it was amazing !
I think that the worst thing about the trip was that on the last night in our room there were a lot of insects and some spiders and we had to change rooms .
Public transport nowadays has become a bit uncomfortable because we can not think of availability of seat .
A large number of people use it , which results in over - loaded buses and trains .
It takes more time to travel by public transport than by personal vehicle . There is a scarcity of buses and the timings too are not fixed .
Traveling by car or any other personal vehicle is much more convenient because it takes much less time and it takes us directly to the place where we want to go .
These days , private transport is more convenient than public transportation . Although public transport like buses , trains , ferries and intercity rail take less time and energy , sometimes it creates problems .
On public transport , people are obliged to share transport with strangers and we also have to follow company policy or regulations , but with our own transport , we do n't have to bother about these things . We travel when we want and when we have time .
We do n't have to book tickets for private transport .
So we can say that travelling in our own transportation is more convenient .
People drive cars to go to work .
The city has a lot of traffic .
They prefer to go to work by car rather than by bus .
Public transport is much cheaper than cars and reduces traffic in the city .
It 's true driving a car is so much more convenient , because people do n't need to wait for a bus .
They can drive at any time , they can come and go at any time .
They can travel to another place irrespective of the time .
Buses , boats and trains are the public transport that are most used by people .
In some cities there are n't boats , because they do n't have a river or the sea .
Buses are common in the city .
Some buses have special and preferential seats for old people .
This is interesting because people practise solidarity .
I think we should have a lot of buses in the city .
Many cars pollute the planet and people are allergic to the pollution .
The train does n't cause pollution .
This mode of transport is better for the population and means that we do n't have traffic in the city .
Another idea is riding a bicycle and walking .
This can help heauthy the people and the city will be cleaner .
So we must reduce cars on the roads .
We will be very happy and we
will be more healthy .
My favourite sport is walking . I really like this sport for several reasons :
1- It 's very common . I can do it anywhere and anytime I want .
2- It 's very cheap . I do not need to buy anything to do it .
3- It 's not a hard sport . In all cases I will not be tired after walking .
4- It makes me relax because I stop doing my activity from work and studying .
5- It gives me a lot of time to think about all my life without any disturbance from anybody .
For all these reasons , walking is my favourite sport .
We fly by plane or something else .
Travelling by car is more convenient in my opinion .
First , you save money if you use a car .
When you travel by bus , you pay more .
Moreover , you travel with other people .
You stand in a queue to buy a ticket .
Secondly , you might feel uncomfortable .
On some means of transport it is too crowded and you haven ' t got a place to stand .
Sometimes you lean against a window .
Finally , if you drive a car , you do n't have to worry about a timetable . You can go at any time .
When you go by bus , for example , you must wait at a cold bus stop .
I hate that .
To sum up , in my opinion , travelling by car is better .
You do n't have to worry that you wo n't arrive on time .
Unfortunately , it is very sad to say that people in my town do not care about the environment .
We need to start doing something to avoid pollution .
So many storms and all the things happening around the world are the result of not taking care of the only planet we have to live on .
I suppose their lifestyle is intolerable , resteless and I really sympathise with them . The majority of outstanding and appreciated people are frustrated .
They turn into arrogant and furious idols because of a lack of private life and perpetual attention .
That is a pitiless trial for celebrities but , through thick and thin , they go on .They achieve the goals made exceptionally for the sake of money and vanity .
Thank you for your attention .
There is one thing that confuses me , and that is the old extension number .
I am always answering wrong calls , and these calls distract me .
I receive a lot of calls looking for the previous employee and I have to spend my time explaining what happened to him .
Also , there are many places to see , mountains and lakes where you can relax and have fun .
I also work in the summer as a waitress in a terrace .
I 'm writing you a letter because I have made a short film with my friends , and I want to tell you what the film is about and what the experience was like .
The idea of making a film came up on a Saturday night at a meeting of friends .
At first we thought that the idea was just a joke , but Jake , one of my friends , said that he had brought a video camera .
When Jake said that , we started to roar with laughter , but then , another friend suggested the idea of making a home movie .
The experience with the film was amazing , because we laughed all night and we enjoyed that very cool idea .
In itself , the film did n't have an special topic , but I can describe it as a friends film , as there is a lot of laughs , jokes , and it shows that friendship is the greatest thing that exists .
By the way , I 'm sending the film r with this letter .
I started running to lose weight and it ended up being a life - changing experience .
Some may say that running is very similar to religion , but to me it is more than that .
Running is cheap and everyone can take up running , no experience required . After all , it is just one step after the other .
In my country , buses are an essential mode of public transport .
So I have had a lot of problems :
1 . Everyone spends a lot of time travelling .
2 . Bus drivers do n't care about the people around them .
That means they are careless people , who always drive too fast .
But public transport has advantages : If we use it is an essential mode of transport for travelling .
Therefore , the environment will be improved .
Maybe traffic accidents will be decreased .
I am writing to report on the local transport in Toluca .
The public transport most used in Toluca is the bus because it is the cheapest , but it is very bad and unsafe . The quality of it is very bad ; the buses are old and obsolete , they have broken windows and old broken seats .
The service is very bad . The drivers are very angry and stressed out so they do not drive with caution . In Toluca there are reports of high numbers of accidents involving buses .
The public transport is unsafe because of an increase in thefts and the kidnapping of users .
I suggest changing the old buses for new buses and putting security cameras on the buses .
Also , that the cameras transmit immediately the images of robbers to other buses to ensure that they are alert , and that the drivers receive training and sanctions for driving badly .
I think we live very fast , always running . We do n't enjoy our lives .
Because we want a lot of money , a lot of things , we are always working to earn more money , we do n't meet our neighbours , for example .
Maybe in the future it will be worse .
There is no future for public transport because the car has made life so easy .
It 's economically and practically more expensive .
prefer to use cars instead of public transport .
In olden times luxuries were not considered as compared to health , but now everyone prefers to save time and maintain privacy , which one can only afford by using her / his own private transport , so gradually , public transport is losing its charm .
I think it 's very important as it reduces the problems of both pollution and crowding . We use fewer vehicles as it is big and carries a lot of people .
The underground , trains and buses . These means of transport are cheap , so it helps the poor to save some money .
Governments should take care of public transport . They should save means of entertainment . People should keep them clean and safe . If they use them carelessly they will be useless . Now there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Cars are faster than public transport , so cars are more convenient than public transport . They are easier , faster and more comfortable , especially for long distances . So , governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars .
Nowadays , travelling has made it easier for humans to move all over the world .
Many people have got used to using their own vehicle as their means of transport , where they can reach their destination on time .
In the following paragraphs , I present my view on this controversial issue .
Firstly , we have different modes of transport , among these is road transport .
As the automotive industry is huge , most householders prefer to buy a car rather than use any other motor vehicle . They can move easily from departure point to destination in no time .
And they do n't need to be dependent on public transport on their journey .
As private transport is increasing day by day , it 's that there may not be any public transport in the future .
Secondly , if private transportation is increasing faster , traffic is also going to create a major problem , which causes global warming .
And the income that is gained through this transport service will automatically decrease , which will create a problem for the economy of the country .
Most illiterate people choose their proficiency as public transportation , like bus service , cab service , auto service .... etc , in order to fulfil their basic needs .
More unemployed people may also lead to a higher crime rate .
I hope giving equal priority to both public and private transportation makes us healthy .
And we can see that controlling the traffic is not going out of the hands .
Here , in this country , there are typical dishes , desserts , drinks .
Some of them are roast , mate and some others , but those are the best known .
On the one hand , I like to have things that are typical in each country , apart from the fact that they are delicious , because when you 've got the opportunity to travel , you can go and experience the food too .
On the other hand , the bad thing about when there is such delicious food , is that you always want to eat some typical food from your country and in the end it 's very bad for the body because we eat it to excess .
In ten years , they did n't change those things , because they are delicious and no one would like to eat anything other than roast !
I think if the government do the best work about the transport , they can save it .
Public transport is the best way to save the planet and have a better atmosphere . Also , we save money and can meet people .
It is true a car is more comfortable , but it uses a lot of mineral resources like petrol which can pollute the atmosphere .
I do n't think public transport does not have a future . There are a lot of people who can not buy a car and they have to use community transport .
Public transport is very complicated nowadays .
Places like Mumbai are full of people and there is no place to park vehicles .
Day by day , the number of people is increasing in Mumbai .
There are more crowds and all the people want to travel by public transport , so it is difficult to travel . The best way to travel is in their
This will save them time .
Public transport is a good way to travel from one place to another place .
I had a word with a boy and he will reply to me by tomorrow .
The Internet is a useful tool for everyone , so we are communicating with distant friends , and we look for important information when we are studying or entertaining ourselves .
First of all , I am going to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of this topic .
The first advantage is that the Internet is very fast . For example , when you want information about something .
The second advantage is that the Internet by websites , such as Twitter , Facebook ... You can speak with your quick friend , or you can meet with them on the website . Therefore , you do not call them on the telephone , because the internet is very cheap .
As for disadvantages , at present , children are always playing with their computer games and mobile phones .
Both computer games and mobile phones have got the internet . As a result , they have not got time for other traditional games .
Another disadvantage is that people do not meet with friends , since they speak on Internet websites , so every time there is unless relationship , the people are not sociable .
To sum up , the Internet is the most important advance in the world , but there are a lot disadvantages and advantages .
From my point of view , the Internet is useful for everyone , but we should not abuse it , and should carry out other activities .
' Good Thriller ' was not my favorite type of genre until I saw ' No Escape ' .
This movie is about what is happening in real life right now , on the other side of the world .
They persecute an American family that went there because of the dad 's job , which was something about a company that the natives of that place hated most .
Without expecting it at all , this family went somewhere in Asia to start a new way of living .
In other words , they had to get used to a different kind of world .
They had to escape with the doors of the country closed , while making sure both girls did n't get their minds full of terrible things ( people killing ) .
And in some of the scenes , the little girls escaped or the dad had to make them jump from one building to another one !
We had a good time .
Hey , I 'm Hoa .
I 'm a student at the Academy of Finance .
There are 5 people in my family : my father , my mother , my older sister and my younger brother .
I want to be an accountant .
I 'm so sorry , but I ca n't come to class next week because I have to work .
Here is a description of my phone - model iphone 6 , gray color and there were scratches on the back .
I am interested in your advertisement you posted in an English language magazine .
Recently I have had a job offer from a company located in London and it requires me to have an IELTS score of 6.5 for the visa .
I haven't studied for this exam at all and I have got very limited time , around 3 months , before the next test , so I would like to begin as soon as possible .
I am working in the daytime , so nighttime , 6 pm to 9 pm , or anytime on weekends would be good for me , except on Mondays and Wednesdays when I play basketball as a hobby .
Also , I am thinking of studying with you for 2 months but we can talk more about this later .
I am good at speaking and listening but not confident at writing , especially essay writing . I 've never studied writing in my life , so I want to focus on this writing part more than others .
Travelling by car is much more convenient but we all know really there is no future for public transport .
When we talk about public transport , there are many people and everyone travels but I think we do not feel relaxed there and if we talk about travelling by car .
Because we can travel anywhere , but on public transport we can not travel to any other places
I think there is a big future for public transport , because a lot of people want to use it and , more than anything else , it is convenient .
In particular , some people do n't have a car and some elderly people find it difficult to drive a car by themselves , so public transport helps them a lot .
Already , public transport has been improved and that makes it comfortable to go on a trip , but I think it will be able to be better and better quality , because so many people expectation .
I like the car as well , but when I have to drive a car , I have to think about parking a lot and I ca n't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am travelling , so public transport is making connections between human beings .
That is why I think public transport is really important for the public and there are a lot of important things that will be possible in the future .
Every human has points of strength and weakness .
So , humans , both women and men , should behave according to these points .
The question which arises now is should the employer hire women for some posts and exclude them from others , and the same for men ?
There are two answers to this question . The first one is from those who say that it is right to exclude women from some jobs .
For example , a builder needs physical strength to carry cement and bricks .
A mechanic should have the ability to deal with the drawbacks of the job .
The second answer is that it is not correct to exclude men or women from any posts .
The explanation of those who support the second answer is that everyone is born equal in terms of duties and rights .
So no one can hire someone or give anyone a job according to gender .
Is it convenient to take a year off between leaving school and starting the university ?
I think it is not necessary and not recommendable because you have the possibility to earn money and it is difficult once you get used to earning money , you want to study again .
Also , if you want to travel , you have to make money for that and then travel .
Furthermore , you do n't study during this period and when you want to start university , you wo n't be able to remember some important things
People use public transport to save money .
Therefore , it is likely that public transport will no longer exist in the future .
I think public transport has a future where all people use public transport . Then I think that maybe it will continue to have a future but it has bad and good things . For example , it is good that it is easier to move in the city and you save time , and the bad thing is that bad people attack you and steal things . But I think that it has a future , because a lot people even if they use public transport to .
People use public transport . Also , people need to move for all the city .
What I ' m saying is that if you have future public transport that people use so much , you will have a future .
Convenience is not the only consideration when we are travelling .
A lot of people choose public transport for travelling because it 's cheaper , easier , more relaxed and sometimes faster than driving a car .
In recent years , governments have encouraged people to take public transport because of the fuel crisis .
Some governments invest a lot of money in constructing public transport networks to make travelling by public transport more convenient .
When driving a car , we will face parking space problems in a city .
Besides , traffic jams are another problem .
My mother is my best friend in my family . She always listens to me . Sometimes I call her by her real name !
She always tells me some jokes , but sometimes I laugh !
, i love her so much . I do n't know what my world would be like without her and I do n't want to know .
I pray every day to save my mother and all my family .
My name is Tom . I 'm 12 years old .
I have . black skin , black hair .
I am wearing a shirt and a pair of trousers .
I will wait for you at the train station .
Well , there are a lot of sports that people do every day , but I have one which is my favourite .
This sport has a lot of types of match which you can play .
You can play with your friends or in a team , or even alone , but this option is the most boring .
Basketball is a perfect sport because you can develop your reflections and your relationships with people .
I enjoy playing basketball because I relax when I play it and I can meet new people and travel around my city or my country . That is the best , because you can visit cities .
And you enjoy yourself with your mates and experience all those special moments with them .
I can give you some advice to start doing this sport .
This is a sport that improves your friendships and it 's so good for your health .
And maybe you will become a famous player or an ordinary player , but you will feel like a famous one .
A river passes by the city and , occasionally , there were floods in the place .
Tired of having their houses destroyed , the landlords decided to build a new house on the hill , so they would n't be bothered by floods anymore .
There is a tale that mentions a treasure hidden in the house .
After the war , the gold was left in the house .
There are 7 billion people in the world , and the number is increasing rapidly .
How many cars for all of the people in the world ?
Have you ever driven in a crowded city and moved at 1 km/h .
When more people use public transport , there are fewer cars on the road , you can walk and enjoy the city .
Besides , it 's also an environmental problem ; exhaust fumes engulf the earth . The more the car is used , the more exhaust gases are released . We are killing our mother earth .
In addition , those who live on below average incomes do not have money to buy a car .
An automobile is a luxury in some countries , like mine .
It 's the way to prove you are wealthy . When you get a car to your home , or go to school or work by car , people will change their minds about you .
Public transport is becoming a must - have means for many people who have a low income .
In conclusion , public transport is our future means of transport . I mean for most citizens .
Not car , though it 's convenient .
My favourite sport is swimming . It makes me feel comfortable and leaves me in a good mood . I go swimming twice a week , and my advice to anyone wanting to start swimming is to enjoy every moment of it .
I have read an article on IFLS that talks about a sheep that has a human face .
It shows in the video that the sheep actually has a big nose and lips just like a human .
Which is one of the weirdest things I have seen .
They say the reason why he has a human face is the farmer gave his mom an extra dose of Vitamin A. As a result , that causes the deformity in his face .
I think it is just a coincidence that the sheep looks like a human .
On the other hand , the farmer who owns the sheep refused to sell the sheep for a higher price than normal to the circus .
I think the sheep should be transferred to a place where there is specialisation in animals with the same condition .
Life is a long journey . Every day , we gain more and more experience .
We become not only older , but also wiser . We learn , but the most useful thing to learn is to get a lot of experiences and , for sure , to make mistakes . But we have to be honest with ourselves and admit our mistakes to avoid them in the future .
I am in Kyoto eating Yatsuhashi .
Becsuse it is turning red !
I have never seen this sight .
I played badminton with my family last night .
As you know , my grandmother currently lives in France with my cousin John . Unfortunately , he has to do a three - month course outside of the country . John needs to leave France next weekend , but it is not possible . I have to go and look after her because none of my family can spend three months over there .
I am so sorry to delay your visit , which was planned months ago , but as I told you , it is not in my hand , but I feel like it was .
Why do n't you come to visit France instead of Spain ?
Send my love to your family , and a big kiss to you !
Dear Sir ,
Nowadays , technology is more modern than in the past and people are always developing their inventions to make them more useful .
We as humans living in these days , rely on technology . Every aspect of our lives is supported by technology .
And because of technology , our lives become easier .
One example is television . In the past , we used it only for watching the news and movies , but as time goes by and the technology develops , now television has other functions .
Television can be used tor many things . Usually we watch television for entertainment , but we can also use it for education too .
First , television has many programs which can be used for education .
Many programs consist of lessons for kids to learn . For kids who still want to learn to speak and know the words , it is very useful , because many programs are very suitable for them to help them learn faster by watching television .
Besides that , we can also use television to make us become knowledgeable , by watching news programs .
Second , these days , television has become modern and that means television can be connected with the internet .
By that advantage , now we can easily search and get information from the internet by using a television .
We can search for it by browsing or we can also access YouTube to help us .
So we can watch a program that we wanted , so we can choose what is good and not .
In conclusion , television can entertain and also educate , because television programs do it in an interesting way .
My favourite sport is football . I enjoy playing football with my friends . We play at night . It is very exciting to play when it 's raining .
When anyone fails to pass the ball or misses a goal we shout in his face " are you crazy ? How did you miss that goal ? "
But we are too interested .
We enjoy watching football matches .
My favourite sport is football .
I 'm not good at playing it , and I prefer to play volleyball , but I like to watch the games .
Football is usually a sport that appeals primarily to males , but I 'm a girl and sometimes I realize that I know more than some males .
I started following football in 2007 , at just 10 years old . I started because I fell in love with a team , and that then led me to love football in general .
I like to watch the games at home with my father , but always go to the stadium with my dad . You feel indescribable emotions . And my father was to convey this passion .
The future of public transport should be taken seriously . In my opinion , public transport is the best option for solving the problems with traffic congestion because , when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people are travelling from one place to other in just one vehicle .
For many years , public transport has allowed people to travel a long distance for work that otherwise would not be possible .
Better still , the future of public transport is essential for a better life without traffic .
When we use a car , in general , one person is the only person who is accustomed to using their own car , so this is not exploiting the potential of the car .
At the same time , we need more cars for more people . That 's the cause of more traffic .
It 's for this reason that I think public transport is a great benefit to society , and a good way for us to move from one place to another . I suggest that the government should invest more money for the purpose of improving public transport .
Hi Freddy ,
I have received your letter .
The men usually wear their best suits and the women have long dresses on
George 's restaurant is a very pleasant place with many tasty recipes from all around the world to enjoy your dinner alone or with company .
The head chef is an experienced and skillful man at his work .
The food his team of chefs prepare is always magnificent and the decoration a work of art . Not to mention that the decoration is fully engaged in the head chef . Not only is the food , but also the restaurant itself is a very beautiful destination .
Designed by famous decorators and their partners
, with the latest technological systems for lighting and beautiful painted walls with great masterpieces by well - known artists and upcoming talents .
Last but not least , the service is remarkable .
The waiters are happy to help in any way they can and work hard enough to reach their full potential so they can relish you .
So fairly George 's restaurant is one of the most universally renowned restaurants .
I 'm afraid I 'm not quite with you , even approve public transport will get more popular in the future .
You ca n't disagree that our world become urbanization in the future , can you ?
That will make our life more and more crowded .
The big deal is entertainment , and quality is part of it .
Keep in mind what you should do before buying your own TV .
However , people nowadays look for a good design and not for quality . The big problem is that price is against quality , even though a good designing of TV series in well - known stores is the big option that we can choose to check .
Consider a good price and good quality by checking and visiting stores . You should not spend too much money by buying the biggest TV , you can save money by only watching a few minutes in stores , take your seat , enjoy and list if you are convinced .
In conclusion , enjoy watching movies on your own TV considering price and quality . Some TV brings you the experience of enjoying your favourite movies in other scenery . Will you try ?
Whether people who reach 18 should do military service is an issue . The supporters suggest that it is helpful for 18-year - olds to train their physical fitness and psychological qualities , whilst opponents point out that it is harmful to human rights and affects the development of a country .
Considering both views , it can be concluded that the government should respect human rights and set up a new department which can be used by people who want to apply to do military service .
In my opinion , our lives will undergo a dramatic change in the next 50 years .
You just have to think that 50 years ago we did n't know what a smartphone or a laptop was , in schools we used books of paper and not tablets or iPads , and now technology is part of our lives .
I think and hope that maybe in 50 years scientists will find a cure for many diseases and that will change our lives , because we could live for longer .
Dear John ,
I want thank you for the invitation but I ca n't come to the party because it is my sister 's s burradas .
I apologise .
I am currently a doing Master 's but I can devote myself to the Fellowship , especially since I have finished the Pre - Masters and now I need only follow up from time to time with my supervisor . So I have the time for the Fellowship .
I agree with the statement that Mark Twain is the greatest American writer .
His works are known all over the world .
When I read his poem " The Adventures of Tom Sawyer " I was excited .
The last thriller I watched was " True Detective " by HBO .
That is an eight - episode film .
First of all , I would like to tell you about the atmosphere of the film .
It is like you are going downstairs to a dark room and feeling curiosity and fear at the same time .
I was impressed because I ' d never seen such films before .
That slow - motion action is so impressive that I have watched it all day .
In particular , I would like to point out Mathew McConnahy 's role .
The philosophy of this hero is so different to what we used to think every day that I have taken a look at my life from another point of view .
Last time I was so impressed watching " Fight Club " by David Fincher .
I usually go to the seaside on Sunday morning .
I work in advertising . I 'm an account .
I hope to see you soon .
This report aims to give a clear idea about preserving the environment in my town .
First of all , the local council organised a competition promoting ecological awareness and encouraging the local community to preserve the environment .
Second , new rules were legislated condemning any person intending to harm the environment in any way .
Third , supporting recycling by inventing three types of rubbish bins for hard waste , for liquids , and the third for clothes .
I am a big fan of Arsenal ,
so it will come as no surprise that my favourite sport is football .
Football is considered to be the most watched and followed sport worldwide .
I would like to look at this sport from different perspectives .
Firstly , football plays a vital role in unifying people locally and internationally . For example , it helps the US and China to normalize their relations .
Secondly , football generates money .
Thirdly , an from aesthetic point of view , it was called the beautiful game by Pele .
Although I have been playing football for years , I am still not a professional player . This may be because I am not talented .
We will learn today some information about Islam . Islam is a great religion that comes from the Arabian Peninsula and it was founded 1436 years ago .
Mohammed was a kindly prophet born in a small city called Mekka and he travelled to another city close to Mekka called Almadina because the people of Mekka were very aggressive and they did not accept the new invitation to the new religion .
Mohammed came back to his town , Mekka , after that and forgave the people of Mekka who abused him .
We will talk about how people 's lives will change in the future .
I think the principal things in our talk are the internet , computers , technology and communications .
Education will not be in schools and universities , but it will be on the internet by many methods like : Self Education , E - learning education , on many websites like : EDX and Coursera and distance education .
Shopping will also be on the internet ; everything will be !
I 'm writing to you because I 'm interested in applying for the job in summer camps .
I saw the advertisement last week in the newspaper and I think that I 'm the right person for the job .
I 'm forty years old and I have experience of looking after children in my town because I have been working in a primary school as a teacher for four years .
On the other hand , I like swimming a lot and I used to play tennis in a local team three years ago .
Moreover , I am a kind - hearted person who enjoys meeting people a lot .
In your advertisement you mention working in kitchens ; I live in a small town and my grandfather was a farmer .
He lived near our town and I used to spend my holidays with him , and , of course , I used to help him with his cows and rabbits , so I could do this work again for your company .
Finally , I think I 'm a friendly woman who likes children and wants to work and learn this summer in the U.S.A. , so ,
I look forward to receiving your answer soon .
Yours faithfully
Firstly , they design the bank notes ' background colour , its artwork and security issues .
Second is the preparation of the metal plates .
It 's done by skilled machinists .
Then the sheets of bank notes are printed . Printing colour on both sides and use special ink and the images are slightly raised .
When printing is finished , they have to be inspected .
It is the most important step .
Printed sheets are manually inspected .
Finally , they find good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheets or bad sheets .
They will package and distribute the sheets which are good .
At this point , they first cut the sheets into separate bank notes . Second , they pack the sheets and dispatch them .
At the same time , bad sheets and bank notes are securely destroyed .
Why not ? Firstly , what 's education for you ? It 's very clear to me that education is creating the conditions to make your thinking grow .
If the way to do that is easy and nice , I think in the end it is better than explaining theoretical concepts .
The other reason for my opinion is that almost all people prefer using the eyes and ears to other people , rather than write and listen to understand new things .
While we are having a good time watching TV , our brain is not in calm , just in another position different to the ones during the rest of the day .
That 's why I think that it 's a good moment to see things in a new way and that can be a very good opportunity .
Definitely , it does not always depend on the kind of programme , but I think that nowadays , a lot of television offers help for people to develop more effectively .
Hunting is the most enjoyable thing I know . I like to hunt because it is so peaceful to be out in the forest .
I started to hunt when I was seven years old .
I hunt with my dad and my stepdad . We hunt all different animals .
The animals I like to hunt most are birds , rabbits , moose and roe deer .
I hunt most with my dad , and we always have great fun when we hunt , but sometimes we can be a bit angry with each other .
Their names are Pluto , Krocken and Zelda .
When I 'm with my stepdad and hunt we have great fun because we stay in a cabin and he 's a really funny man too . I laugh every evening and have great fun .
They 've got many moose , so they shoot a lot of them , and they shoot at least every time I am there .
My stepdad shot a very big moose when I was there with him and I got the trophy of the moose .
I am communicating with you with the purpose of letting you know that we are going to set up a meeting at my office with the purpose of discussing how we could use social media to improve the communication with our suppliers . I think a great time for the meeting would be next Monday at 4:00 p.m
I am going to communicate to you something about military service .
The purpose of this letter is to notify you about some complaints that some citizens have . This is related to why only boys have to be in the draft for military service , and girls do not have to .
I think we want to have equal rights for both .
How are you ? I am fine .
When I go to the restaurant , I always eat Mexican food such as tacos or fajitas .
I would n't mind eating there every day !
However , I just go to the restaurant on special occasions , such as my birthday or when I pass an exam .
I would like to go next Friday . Do you want to go with me ?
This diagram is used to illustrate the process of making bank notes , covering seven main stages .
First of all , we should think of a design and decide the background colour and artwork , or even security issues .
And then , for the preparation of metal plates , skilled machinists are used .
Next , printing . Sheets of bank notes are printed ( 50 bank notes per sheet ) with colour on both sides , and specWell , the . Well , the most important step is inspection , printed sheets should be manually inspected .
Have you ever spent the holidays combining fun and knowledge ?
When I used to spend my vacation in Mecca after doing my Omrah , I visited several places . Among them was a house for teaching the holy book of Quran .
This house can be characterized as containing large numbers of students who have memorized the holy book of Quran .
It is located between neighborhoods with aesthetic characters in the Alhijaz design area .
And conservation mechanism followed in this house encouraged students to become a part of it .
Finally , if you want to rest and have good companionship , go to this house .
The pyramids were not made by machines or computers and that is from the secrets of the ancient Egyptians of how they could build a great building like that about 7,000 years ago and it is still strong now . People from all over the world come to Egypt to see it s great civilization . Around 2 million people come to the pyramids yearly . You can be one of them .
Come visit the land of peace and civilization .

My favourite sport is fitness . I love going to the gym , because there we meet new people , make friends and we can relax .
I always go to the gym . I look all the time separate 1 hour and half for that .
When I am there I can relax and I try to not think about my problems and my work .
I enjoy myself all the time when I am there .
On Wednesday after that I go to my belly dance lessons . I love it , because I can express all my feelings .
Sometimes we have a presentation and competition .
I feel very proud about that .
I think everyone should do one sport . We can feel better after that and that is very good for our health .
Effective teachers have clear and consistent communication and management skills .
The teacher uses lesson time effectively .
Studies and monitors students ' progress , helps them to deal with their problems .
I was in a park when I saw a man standing just behind me .
So I started to walk away from there , but the guy started to follow me .
So I had to walk quickly until I could enter an old and abandoned house behind the park .
I started to walk through the house until I heard a noise .
Then a ghost appeared in front of me and the guy appeared behind me .
This city is located in the north of Extremadura .
In C√°ceres , we take care of the environment .
The people in this city are aware that there are care of nature .
Therefore , in this city there are not many factories .
The people recycle the rubbish and they throw away the rubbish in different containers .
The yellow container is for plastic , like water bottles ; the blue container is for cardboard , like milk cartons ; the green container is for glass , like glass bottles .
Every day , sweepers clean the Caceres streets and people teach their children that rubbish must n't be thrown away in the street .
Sagrada Familia , also called Gaudi 's Cathedral , is a very touristic Roman Catholic church located in Barcelona which is still under construction .
Antoni Gaudi was the Catalan architect who designed it in 1798 and in 1882 its construction got started .
Nowadays , due to the current economic crisis , its construction has been stopped until an undetermined date .
When I was ten years old , I really liked to play football very much . I joined a football team which is near to my home . I prefer this team because my family is not rich , they can not provide for my transportation fees to go to do exercise at a stadium .
The team is not very famous , but I know in the future it will be .
I try to be a football player there .
The team name comes from the local area , which is AKSARAY . I like to play and watch football as well .
I want to advise all students to start this sport for their health and to get rid of stress . Sports mean is not like to spell time and to loss calorie .
After doing sport , you will feel your body becoming strong and your brain will be without stress .
Therefore , everyone must do sport according to their ability .
Finally , I like to play football for my health .
In my life , many dreams have existed in my mind which are sweet , incredible , magical or horrible .
However , one of my dreams stays in my heart so that I ca n't ever forget it .
One night , as usual , I was sleeping .
In a flash , I rolled down a mountain and I did n't know where I was .
It was just a very long tunnel that was dark and strange . After , I felt my body ache .
I began to yell and hoped someone could help me to leave there .
Fifty minutes passed , and my body was no longer sore .
While I struggled to walk .
Finally , I saw a light appear and I woke up .
It makes me feel that it was a strange dream .
Nowadays we see an enormous improvement in infrastructure .
Nevertheless , travel by car is easier for commuters , for example , because they can choose a personal timetable without the terrible discomfort of buses . In addition , there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport , especially if the government invested their money in green energy and we could discover a new green car , which in turn , would revolutionise our lives .
Well , the way that we use television depends on each one of us .
We will have people that use the television as fun , most of the time ; but we also have other people that use television for research .
For example , the channel '' Animal Planet '' has a lot of information about animals and how they live .
In my opinion , people use television for distraction .
When we come home after work , or school , we need a way to relax .
Maybe studies we do in another way ; in research on computers , in books , etc ...
The television is being more and more utilized by people , so we are getting more problems with vision .
The capitalist world makes us increasingly become us updated .
So we have to watch the national news to keep us connected .
Nowadays , everybody has the ability to buy a television , so the numbers of TV viewers is going up ; even if you are poor or rich ; most can watch a movie , or a documentary .
There are no excuses not to be an informed person .
Going shopping is one of those things that you can love or , like me , you can hate .
Normally , I do n't spend a lot of time on going shopping , even when I really need something .
In general , I find it very boring and stressful .
If I must do it , my favourite way of shopping is on the high street of my town , or in another town or country .
The shopping centres , full of people and noise , are crazy !
Shopping online is also not , from my experience , a good way of shopping .
In my case , I 'm always wrong with the sizes and returning the products , takes me a long time and a great effort , so it is n't worth it .
It is much better to take a walk along the high street and do something for pleasure during this time .
Socializing online helps us to contact our friends in an easy way in different places and this way does n't cost us money .
Socializing does not cost us money , but we need one place to contact each other .
Finally , we enjoy both ways in our life .
For the last few years , public transport has been forgotten .
People who do n't use public transport , think that travelling by car is much better .
But they do n't know about the big problem with pollution .
If everybody used public transport , the world would be much better , and people will be less stressed , because they will be not worried about parking spaces or being in the traffic .
Maybe it will be a really good opportunity for people to be more healthy too .
Compared with local bookstores , publishers or media such as newspapers considering the Internet market , public transportation has a much better future .
You have to take very great care when you carry humans .
Even though people try to develop drones to reduce logistical costs , it is difficult to apply technology to carrying humans .
The second reason is that automatic driving technology needs some more time for development .
Also , automatic driving technology is already applied to trains .
We are going on a vacation next week .
We prefer to take a flight to Hawaii .
We love to travel here and there , but this is the place I have wanted to go a since long time ago .
I hope it will be fun there , and thinking about the beautiful scenery makes me feel that I must go while I can . I ca n't wait till the day comes .
Dear Hadeel ,
Following your letter , I want to tell you about the apartment . It is very beautiful , not big or small , but medium - sized with two rooms inside , a bathroom and a dining room and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view . I am sure he will like it . to come and Tri condo b soon , n the end , I would say that I miss you so much and I hope to see you soon .
That 's because swimming is really fun .
Also , I think swimming can keep your body fit and it can make the swimmer cool down when it is a sunny day .
The advice that I would give to someone who wants to start swimming .
It is not to be afraid of the water , otherwise they ca n't learn to swim , and also , when they get older , it will be more difficult to learn than when they are young .
So , this is the advice that I would give them .
English - I find it great !
I ca n't pronounce well .
I do n't know where the stress of words is .
It 's so difficult .
So annoying when I ca n't continue learning English .
Michael was a little boy . He was 10 years old . He went with his parents to his grandfather 's home .
The home was on the shore . There was a tunnel and it 's hole was in the deep . At first he used to be polite and obey the other orders .
Once a day , he met a girl called Sarah . She was 9 years old . Although Michael was bigger , Sarah could control him . Every day they went to the sea to play and swim until the sun set . Once a day Sarah made a challenge to Michael about who could enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out of the other hole on the shore , but Michael was afraid . He was asking himself which animals could be there or if there was air there , but he had no choice , so he accepted the challenge . Sarah told him she would go first . She took a breath ... a deep one , and started to dive .
Micheal was afraid . He waited for Sara to get out . He went to the shore to see if she came from the other side , but he found no footprints . His mother called him and he went home still thinking about Sarah . It was night and he was afraid to go there again . He went to sleep . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
A clean and healthy environment is always acceptable to all kinds people .
Our city is quite clean and habitable ; people are more careful than before .
They are sincerely managing waste and avoiding carbon - generated products .
Also , they obey the rules and regulations of the city authorities .
First , the waste management system of our area is more effective than before .
Our authorities now follow the scientific method for rubbish control ; recycle , reuse , galvanization .
As a result , the city - dwellers are now enjoying a more healthy environment .
It is a more expected criteria , why the authority step up many organizations working for waste management .
Due to our help , people 's work has become easier .
In most cases , not only my family members but also our neighbors like to avoid carbon - level - increasing products that are responsible for temperature increases .
Many organizations work to raise the environmental awareness of pupils , so people are more concerned about environmental pollution .
Now , the government is working to decrease smoke emissions from the mills and industry .
Scientists and researchers jointly work to reduce carbon emissions .
Some progress has been made already ; it s implementation also runs at full speed .
Last but not least , the strict rules and regulations have a more effective impact on making a good town .
Our authorities are more careful about the rules and regulations ; hence no - one can disobey the rules .
The job announcement on your webpage immediately grabbed my attention , as it has always been my dream to work for the German - Norwegian Youth Forum and the requirements are just the skills that I can provide you with .
The first time I took part in the youth forum was in 2012 , and since then , it has been a big part of my life .
Influenced by it , I started to look for universities in Scandinavia .
Since 2013 , I have been studying English and Marketing Communication at University College Syddanmark .
It is well accepted that shopping is not always enjoyable , and the following are my reasons .
Firstly , shopping can waste so much of your time .
You may not realize it when you shopping happily .
But you may find that when you notice you have many things you still need to finish .
You may come across something , such as a luxury bag , but you can not buy it because of the tight budget .
Furthermore , even if you just buy something you can afford , you may also waste much more money .
So , based on what I have written , I think shopping is not always very happy . We can easily find something much happier than shopping .
My favourite sport is cricket . I have loved cricket very much since from my school days .
Cricket is a game of bat and ball in which there are two teams which have eleven players on each side .
Generally , we use a cricket ground which has an oval shape .
Travelling by car is certainly much more convenient than travelling by trams or trolleybuses , which only follow the lines of their routes .
But thinking about the environment , traffic jams and sometimes the absence of parking spaces makes me change the statement .
On the one hand , you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to . On the other hand , if you feel not well enough to drive , you have no money to buy a car , or the downtown of your city is closed to all means of transport except for public ones , the tram , bus or trolleybus is your way out .
HOW CAN YOU BEST LOOK AFTER YOUR ENVIRONMENT ?
Good question about item , how can answer , if you want to win ¬£ 100 .
Firstly , I will describe how I can help my local environment and what I do that is useful for it .
I have been a very strict and keen ecologist for 10 years .
I am interested in natural ways we can help in the local area .
I am a serious fan of the environment .
I describe how it looking my everyday life .
I tend to ride my bicycle from home to work , I have n't used my car or buses for a long time , because it is not healthy and costs a lot .
A bicycle is for me the best way we can be fit and in a good condition and also create less pollution without cars .
Secondly , I save water and electricity , because the costs are quite expensive .
So , my bills for water are inexpensive , because I have swapped having a bath to taking a shower .
Next point is an issue , that if I am not at home , I switch off the heating .
I switch on the home heating for a temporary period . When I am working from home , I use more energy to warm my home .
The next point is the fact that recycling glass and paper is very important .
I tend to collect three different boxes of waste , for paper , second for glass and plastic and third for the rest of my rubbish .
It 's a very domestic and a huge issue for our lives .
We learn to really segregate waste and , in the future , how we could , for example , use the same glass a second time .
Finally , we are obligated to care about the environment , because it 's our duty .
I think it is true , because a lot of people like travelling by car .
But there are some problems , like these - how will a lot of people drive who do n't like to drive or ca n't drive because they have some problems with their health .
Anyway , a lot of people will need some transport in some cases , not private , but public , and we ca n't say that this kind of transport will not be useful .
Maybe , in small part
Some years ago when the weather was colder here people ate more meat with wine . In fact , growing vegetables was not possible because of the weather .
In fact , today people are interested in drinking wine when attending parties or meeting with friends .
There are various opinions about how foods play an essential role in our lifestyle .
Potatoes and meat are popular foods among our people .
Although a healthy diet is quite expensive , young people follow special diets in order to have a better body shape or a healthy life .
Actually , modern life has caused our palate to change . Instance some people who work the majority of their waking hours prefer to eat fast food more .
Our commitments cause us to forget ourselves and our health .
It may cause increasing weight or reducing the number of necessary vitamins which our body needs .
In my view , the reason for having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us .
In conclusion , if we make a decision to live longer , following a suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable .
The members of my family are nowhere near my best friends .
You see , I do not see members of one 's family as one 's best friends because , personally , I did n't and still do n't have a great relationship with anyone in my biological family .
And this may have affected my way of thinking and acting in different situations .
So no , the members of my biological family are n't my best friends .
Thank you for giving me the chance to pass on this information as per your request .
In my town , there are many regulations that are enforced by the municipality and the environment ministry , such as preventing animals like sheep , horses , cows .. etc , from being in the town and in the populated areas .
Besides , due to the critical situation we are experiencing and facing in Iraq .
As we are fully dependant on individual generators , these are causing multiple problems with the weather due to their smoke , oil and gas left behind , in addition to noise , of course , because they are the main source of the 18 continuous hours of noise .
People , especially generator owners , have started using Canaopies , using very long pipes to get rid of as much as they can of the pollution .
Other residential areas , using their potential to maintain the environment by planting trees , roses , have numerous green spaces .
Also , recycling the trushes is a very intelligent way to keep the town clean and get multiple uses out of the products in industry lines .
on the other hand , the eldest people in our city have many social responsibilities and are encouraging the youngest people to participate in the annual gardening festival for the indoor and outdoor gardens .
Although each household can make a real difference by taking good care of the area in front of their houses and keeping it clean .
Hope that this information is useful
Michael and Marcuangolo were friends , but in school they were enemies . They had amazing battles in the playground .
One day , at the end of classes , Marcuangolo wanted to hit Michael , and Michael ran away .
A car crashed into him and Marcuangolo started bleeding .
There was a doctor in the emergency room and Michael explained the problem to him .
They took Marcuangolo to a room and put the boy in a bed .
The doctor asked for his phone number and he phoned his parents .
As soon as I came to university , my life changed .
Before I started university , I had n't a lot of friends and I was so lonely , but after I started to study at Ton Duc Thang university , I became more happy , comfortable and sociable .
In my class , I have a group of close friends , and they treat me very well .
The first day I studied at the university , I made a lot of friends .
We sit around together and talk about where they live .
At the weekend , I like going for a walk and getting some fresh air with my friend .
We laugh and eat together .
I expect we 'll be best friends forever .
It was a wonderful experience for me .
I was walking to a football training session with my friend Michal last week .
We were talking about the last match . We were discussing our faults , when suddenly we heard a loud noise .
I ran to help them and we also called an ambulance .
I live in Deria which is located in Dubai .
It is a small and quite city .
I like the Indian restaurants in the city . In addition , the infrastructure and roads are well organised .
obeying to the statement above , it 's necessary to say that this is a very interesting topic , because it 's closely related to actual problems , such as problems with the environment .
That is to say , that most cars are not green , namely ; current cars are not designed to have a good impact on the environment .
Regarding the reason for the described situation , it is due to the strong economic interests of oil companies , which are aimed at getting as much money as possible , regardless of the damage that they are causing to species of plants and animals .
For multinationals maybe ?
Or for some consumers that can afford a toxic and expensive car
, even though , when the public transport gets so crowded , it is indeed less harmful , in terms of the impact on the environment , because it means more individuals in the same place , whereas each new car means increasing pollution .
Travelling by public transport would be more convenient with a good conscience of protect the planet .
The idea of banning cars from the centre of all major cities has advantages and disadvantages .
The good things about not allowing cars in city centres are that the traffic will be reduced , trips will be faster and the pollution will be reduced .
On the other hand , the bad things are that you have to park outside of the city centre and these areas will be crowded , you ca n't visit places with your car and people with physical problems could have difficulties with public transport .
In my opinion , it is a good idea , but perhaps the restriction could have exceptions for certain people and certain days and times , or if you need to visit a particular place with your car , you could ask for special permission .
In the village where I live , there is a lot of vegetation . For that reason , we try to protect the environment . One of the things we do is to do maintenance every week to the vegetation zone , checking if there is any garbage . To avoid this , we teach the younger generation environmentalist actions so they do n't throw cans , paper , or candies on the floor . They can also help the older people . There are cases where a person throws garbage on the street or on the vegetation . To avoid that happening again , we have a punishment that is to pay some money . If they do n't , they wo n't be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again , unless they are visitors . In that case , we tell him or her the way we live in the village and , we give him or her advice to keep a beautiful place without garbage .
Another environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by taking care of them . For that we have a care centre and , other additional institutions . We also make environmental protection centers where people can visit and learn about this . To sum up , our village is very focussed on taking care of the natural world that surrounds us .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am one of the students at Telemark University College .
I am studying on the Literature and Language bachelor programme .
I am so interested in this major .
But it is not relevant to my future life .
It is from the bachelor programme to the 1 year programme .
how are you ? I have just received your letter .
In my country there are many interesting places to visit and it is a country to improve with your job , also , also , it is easy to find a job . There are many jobs and many different types of jobs .
This country has many interesting places to visit . If you want to have an adventure , you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza .
If you want to have fun , you can go to Parque de la Costa . There are many interesting rollercoasters .
And if you want to go to the best museum of art in Argentina , you should go to Malba .
See you soon ,
In my opinion , public transportation is the most convenient way to travel . The air pollution is one reason that I prefer public transportation .
In addition , it is more economical than owning a car .
You can save time and go anywhere more quickly by public transport .
Nowadays , in school , we learn a lot of subjects which we use more or less in our lives . Some of them are really important , but some of them are just a waste of time .
I was born in Danderyd 's hospital in 2001 .
When I was born , I weighed 3650 grams and I was 52 centimeters tall .
I have one big brother , he is 14 years old and goes to M√∂rby Skolan .
I have only lived in one place in my life .
I like parkour because it 's really fun . I also like guitar and playing video games .
The best place I 've visited is probably Orlando because I like all the amusement parks and roller coasters .
My favorite is the Hulk roller coaster at universal studios .
My favorite foods are pizza , tacos and kebab .
The given topic to write about is a common issue nowadays in my country .
Public transport is not convenient for most the people because every person wants to arrive at his destination on time , but when using public transport it is very difficult to arrive on time .
It all began in 1981 when Freddy Fazbear 's Pizza opened . The establishment is a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant had robots . In 1981 there were four animatronics and their names were Chica , Foxy , Bonnie and Freddy .
Three robots at a specific hour perform a show with instruments like a band .
Foxy the pirate performs a show on her own in her pirate cove . The children love Foxy because he plays with the kids , answering questions about the pirates and telling a pirate story .
When Freddy began to sing , the kids screamed and they sang with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear 's Song . Bonny played the drums and Chica served the pizza to the children , This year the establishment closed because they found the body of a dead child .
In 1983 , the pizza restaurant reopened with more security and robots with a more friendly appearance .
The establishment sought a security guard who had to guard the pizza restaurant at night . I am the security man .
When I saw the advertisement for the job , in that time , I thought that it would be very easy . I called the number , they give me the information , and I accepted .
The rules are simple : just look at the laptop , watch the animatronics , wait until 6:00am and close the doors if you need to . I said OK .
My first night was easy because I only watched the screen and passed from camera to camera and nothing strange happened . I could only hear footsteps and noises .
My second and third nights were very strange because on the cameras the animatronics moved as if they wanted to get to my room and do something to me .
The fourth and fifth nights were the worst because the animatronics were very active , they closed and opened the doors because they were trying to get into my room .
But I managed to survive the night .
After tonight , I left the place and never went back to Freddy 's Pizza .
My name is Lorenza .
My hair is brown and my eyes are dark . I will arrive at the Central Station at eleven o'clock and I will wear a read coat and a yellow scarf .
This holiday I am in Barcelona with my girlfriend .
It is an amazing city , it is really fun .
It is the most European city in Spain .
After a long flight , it reaches an orbit that is a very long way out of the solar system .
NASA replied that it was a really amazing achievement that Rosetta left the solar system .
This may be the greatest leap since Armstrong landed on the Moon .
NASA replied that Rosetta will keep on its journey travelling across the Universe .
Travelling by car is becoming a comfortable factor nowadays because we can stop and go whenever we want , we can start at our desired time .
This will gradually kill public transport .
One more reason is that banks provide loans at a lower interest rate , which makes people buy one to improve their comfort level .
People 's lives will not change if they do n't change themselves . Everyone wants to improve his life to make it better but how can we do that without doing anything ? We must start with education and health , which are the most important things to be better .
Everyone needs to focus not only on his education but also on others .
To learn , to read , to be knowledgeable .
We need to focus on our inner skills and improve them .
No progress will happen without a plan . Each person has a dream he wants to achieve , but first of all he needs to put a plan in place and also a cognitive one .
Our great example of change is Germany .
After the Second World War , they improved themselves in 50 years and became one of the most developed countries .
In my city is very usual to find a lot of dog shit in the road .
It is a big problem and it is almost a miracle not to step in one .
The solution , I think , would be to fine owners .
I think that is not a problem of awareness .
I think people know that their dogs litter the city , but they prefer not to do anything .
It is easier and more convenient .
If they had to pay , then they would do it .
In general , the city looks clean .
In the town hall , they care about the city center .
These also can be a problem , because recently they are falling down because they are old .
The town hall has created a group that works studying the tree s ' age to prevent further falls
We should properly plan for our city to properly look after it .
Actually , there are many huge problems in our city just as there is no proper drainage system for it , nor any specific canal system through which we can properly clean our city .
There is another issue that is due to heavy traffic but few roads that are wide enough so that most people are distributed due to these issues .

Istanbul is located in Turkey .
It is the capital city of turkey and it has a large area . There are a lot of people living in Istanbul .
Istanbul buildings are so simple and have a different design than other cities .
I think it will be changed to become a bubile city and contain more high buildings .
What erer Whether it changes or not , I will always like it more than any place in the world .
My name is Alejandro Mart√≠n . I 'm 30 years old . I have heard about your organization and I would like to work for you .
I used to go to a Christian school here in Granada . In that school there were good values , like sharing or helping other people .
Moreover , my parents , who are teachers , taught me how I should educate , for several years .
I ask myself If I had the possibility to change the world , would I try to do all that in your hands .
I always think this , because teenagers are the future of our planet .
I 'm looking forward to your reply .
Best wishes .
I was born in 2001 on August the 10th in Danderyd .
My favorite sports/ hobbies are windsurfing and sailing .
The best place I have ever been is on an island in the east archipelago in Sweden .
There are not many trees there and a lot of high mountains .
There is a lot that I 'm proud of in my life , but actually I do n't know what I 'm most proud of .
A very big weakness I have is that I can forget nearly everything , especially homework and other school stuff .
Three words that describe me really well are :
happy , funny and sometimes bothersome .
A thing that I would like people to know is that it 's not a good idea to wake me when I 'm sleeping .
Someday I want to go to Bali , because it seems like a really nice place .
Three things that I could do with is a bike , to be sick and bad computers .
My favorite movie is The Wolf of Wall Street .
I do n't have a favorite book .
My favorite song is Prayer in C .
My favorite singer is AVICII .
Simpsons or Family Guy .
My favorite food is fillet of beef with bea and pommes .
My favorite restaurant is TGI Fridays .
When I learned to windsurf .
If you have a car , you probably think that travelling by car is better than by bus , but there are a lot of people who do n't have a car , so they are used to going by bus and , for them , this way of travelling has become more convenient , because they have done it since they were children .
Therefore , whatever opinion you have is the result of the social situation in which you live .
Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars , and they say that it 's cheaper and better for the environment . As for me , I think that cars are easier and an affordable way to travel between places , because cars are here anytime and so near to your home , unlike public transportation , which you have to walk to to reach in most countries . And also , cars are available all the time . You can go at 4 am and no one will say anything , because it 's yours , but most public transportation is available only for the daylight hours and a few hours at night , in an emergency situation for example , what will you do if you do not have your own car ? Your kid is sick , or your wife or your elderly parents . And , in general , the more we rely on ourselves , the more our government is able to help the poor and homeless people out there , who really need more help and aid from the public community . We merely ask the government to improve the streets and the traffic light systems , and more petrol stations and parking in the streets , to be able to drive and move around easily and safely and in a short amount of time .
Everyone uses public transport every day .
It is difficult to imagine how we could live without it .
But in spite of this , a lot of people have a dream about owning a car .
Most people say that using a car is more convenient than using public transport .
Of course , private transport has a lot of advantages , like , you do n't need to wait for a bus at the stops or you can go everywhere you want at a time convenient for you .
How are you ? You know , it has been a long time since we have seen each other . Why do n't we go to the cinema ?
We are going to look for a romantic movie or a science fiction movie .
So , what time will you finish school ?
I will wait for you at the cinema entrance .
27-dresses is a romantic comic and funny film . It is recommended for all ages .
I saw it with my family ; my children and my husband . We had a good afternoon .
The film is about a girl . She is invited to many weddings and she is a maid of honor at all of them .
She has twenty - seven maid of honor dresses . Meanwhile , she falls in love with a boy who is very handsome , but he works for a magazine and he has written about weddings in the city . He is a good writer , and she unknowns that .
The plot is well constructed , it becomes quite gripping from the beginning .
The main characters are very young and enjoyable .
This story develops a mixture of themes such as courage , family values , friendship and love .
In conclusion , if you want to have a good time , you should go to the cinema to see this film with your family , because it is an interesting and emotional film .
Nowadays , we have a lot of environmental problems .
Transport pollution is one of the most dangerous .
Almost every family has more than one car .
As a result , roads are overloaded and long traffic jams damage the air .
On the one hand , that quantity of cars ca n't be forbidden , because it 's a personal right to have one or not .
On the other hand , the government should think about some measures for protecting the environment .
For example , introducing several special dates in a year for using only public transport .
Also , another improving measure might be increasing green areas in cities and towns .
Unfortunately , many tourists do n't care about keeping personal spaces ( on the river bank or on the beach ) clean .
Factories damage nearby areas and water extremely badly .
In my opinion , firstly , new buildings on the banks must be forbidden at all .
Secondly , rules for tourists about caring for the environment must be very strict .
I think nature will get the most important benefits if everybody takes care of his own space in the best way .
Sport is a unique way by which a person can maintain his or her health , including both aspects that are physical and mental .
The different formats of cricket allow me to maintain my health based on the time available after earning my daily bread and , needless to say , after sharing precious moments with my lovely family .
I often participate in friendly matches to keep my physical abilities up to the mark .
While putting a lot of stress on physical abilities , it goes without saying that the day can be tiring if one decides to play the longer version of the game , but it is equally challenging as to how you will keep up your mental status .
It does require you to explore your brain while developing strategies against the opponents .
Above all , one has to learn to maintain sportsmanship , irrespective of the result or heated moments on the field .
In today 's world , television is very important .
But sometimes it can also affect us in a negative way . Most people around the world can see any news live . Media is more helpful for people . Television is also used as a study resource , for example for smart classes ,
online courses etc . Television is a very important medium . We can improve our language with the help of the television . Now we can see
that so many films with the help of television and we can see other programs also . to the present world without television
no one can live as a human being so that we can say that television is more important .
Michael was a serious boy , he had the ability to behave in a good way , help his parents with daily activities .
Michael 's parents were absolutely poor , they hardly paid school fees for him , although they did their best to see him be educated .
One day , Michael was going to school for his final examination .
Suddenly , an old carrying a heavy load hit him and fell down .
When he got up he insulted him and tried to beat him . When he returned home , he closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
My name is Natalia Refana .
I have worked as a teacher for ten years .
I am also a volunteer for a youth church club .
All my free time , I work with children and teach them .
On holiday we do different sports , cook on the fire and have fun .
Hello!I am a 32-year - old girl from Italy .
I really love taking care of myself , and so , last year I decided to go walking every day in the evening .
It takes 1 hour and at the end I am very happy and in a good mood .
I love walking near the harbour of my city , so I can have a look at the beautiful sea ! when I walk I feel the clean wind , and so , I take deep breaths .
If you walk at the seaside in the evening you can also have the possibility to see the sunset over the sea .... that 's great emotion ! I feel good in that way and even my soul can have a breath .
I suggest everybody should have the same evening walk . You just need a pair of comfortable shoes !
Commuters prefer to travel by car compared to public transport .
The main reason for people not liking to travel by public transport is overcrowding .
Travelling by train is very expensive nowadays .
As you know , I worked in a youth camp last year , so if you want to take this job I would like to say some things that will help you .
On the positive side , the size of the groups is really small .
This kind of job is very useful if you want to improve your English skills .
On the negative side are the labor conditions . The money is not enough to pay for the cost of living in London and in addition the money for " travel expenses " , in my case , did n't arrive until November !
Anyway , I recommend that you take the job for August , because I have heard that in that month the organization is better than in July .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately that he had planned two weeks ago .
This event was his sister 's birthday . " Now is the suitable moment to announce her surprise " , Peter said .
Then peter started , " happy birthday my lovely sister " , peter said , and gave her a car key .
Sara was so amazed and hugged her brother and thanked him .
After that , the celebrations began and a lot of their friends came , each one presented a gift to Sara . She was really delighted and , suddenly , the doorbell been rang
It was her old friend Tia .
Sara stood and stared at her for a few minuets and hugged her and bowed her for coming and thanked her . They had n't seen each other for several years since they had finished their studies . Really it was a great moment and they stay speaking together about many things and call the best moment that collect them together , stay speaking until the evening , and agreed to visit their college at the weekend to recall the best memories . It was Peter who arranged this celebration and contacted Tia and prepared for all this to happen . Sara never forgot that day .
It 's much faster and much more convenient than using public transportation .
The only drawback that comes along with using cars is limited fuel resources .
However , it seems that each day a new way of extracting fuels is being explored .
Beijing is the capital of China , it is the political , economic and cultural center , but also a city with a long history .
It was the capital of the Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty , so it has a lot of ancient architecture , like Ming Tombs , the Summer Palace , The Temple of Heaven , the Forbidden City .
The Forbidden City , especially , is the largest architectural complex which is the best - kept in the current .
It . It represents the highest architectural achievement in ancient China .
The Great Wall is located to the north of Beijing .
It is more than thousands of miles long .
Building started in the Qin dynasty . Its purpose was to resist the Huns , but now it is a great place to visit .
If we 're planning for what we have , then we are behind the curve " , Anthony Fox .
When we talk about convenience , comfort and safety , then private transport is more likely to be considered .
In certain emergency cases , running for a bus seems harder than jumping into your own car .
Private transport travel is totally on your own , so there remains no tension about reaching a certain stop at a specific time .
Travelling privately makes one free of issues like harassment .
Although many transport providers are trying to eradicate this problem , it still remains .
Public transport can cause problems for passengers due to increasing fares .
People often tend to go on their own , as private vehicles , such as cars can be bought easily with loans provided by banks .
Looking on a wider span , cars are available these days according to public demand .
The above discussion suggests that people find private transport a safer , more convenient and comfortable way of travelling .
Suddenly , we heard the sound of running footsteps .
Perhaps someone had been killed , or kidnapped in the street .
There was an old granny who had been beaten up .
We tried to give her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that . Then we tried to find help ,
but nobody was opening their doors .
On Luckily , I had a mobile phone , but Michael said that we needed to run away because we did not know whether those bullies were around the corner .
My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I did that .
After we came to the ambulance , police , the police came and one patrol caught those men who did that to that granny and the other patrol talked to us .
I found out that the granny 's name was Rose and she had had an operation after the incident .
To our relief , she was saved and when we went to the granny 's room , we saw a smile on her face .
We were also happy , but in Michael 's head there were a lot of things .
He knew that if we had run away at that moment when the granny was on the ground , she would most probably die .
My name is Kamaldeen . I 'm 31 years old . I 'm married and I do n't have children .
I grew up in Al Qassim region and I had the best time of my life in Al Qassim .
I have a big family contains from my father and mother and I have seven brothers and three sisters .
I studied at Al Qassim University and my major was Microbiology .
I graduated from my college in 2001 . After that , I got a job at the Ministry of Health and I have been working there since 2010 .
I like a lot of activities , such as travelling , reading , playing soccer and watching movies .
I still believe that public transport will be more popular in the future due to the benefits it provides for us . Travelling by car is more convenient but expensive .
Travelling on public transport is cheaper .
On the other hand , not everybody can own a car .
Public transport is suitable for those who have no car of their own .
Besides , public transport will reduce traffic jams .
Today , governments focus on how to improve public transport and they also increase their support .
This sport causes fresh and jolly me and I think exercise will cause me to be healthy . If you start volleyball , you need a ball and a piece of ground that is separated by a net .
Shopping takes place the biggest part especially for women , but sometimes it is not so enjoyable and I agree with this statement .
First of all , shopping is not satisfying when you are tired , or you are hungry , or maybe it is just your personality that does n't like crowds of people walking around .
Secondly , if you can not find what you are looking for , you will not beam with joy .
What is more , you will not be satisfied with the shopping if you lack money and can not afford to buy the thing that you really want .
To sum up , I would like to say that , if you are in bad mood or lack money , then you will not be able to take pleasure in it .
Human life has changed a lot in recent years , and it seems that this will happen faster every day . Technology advances and the changes in our way of thinking are adapting to a different kind of people with each human generation .
Technology advances way too fast and it is really difficult to guess what kind of stuff or artefacts there will be fifty years from now , but we can guess some ideas , like flying cars , smartphones the size of a small piece of paper , really thin laptops like a quarter of an inch , clothes that clean themselves or change color and shape , healthier food , smarter domestic appliances .
All this will help people to live easily , but only to have more time to work , because the type of mind that reigns in that time will focus on companies and making money and spending it . This is the reason why a lot of jobs are changing to home offices and the firms are giving more and more facilities for their employees to be more efficient .
Finally , the kind of life that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help people to have a more comfortable , easier and faster way of life , but this will be only to make more money and consume more and more . Also , things will be faster of waste to make people change their possessions more often and stimulate consumerism .
Nowadays , an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon of farmland , forest and wetland disappearing because of some long - term human activities , for instance housing and transport networks are built , destroying the balance of the environment .
Firstly , it is clear that more houses and transport networks are convenient for our people . What is known to us is that the population growth is a big problem which creates a need for more space for living in .
And building more transport networks is also a benefit for us , for example , the high - speed rail can shorten the time spent on traveling , while the animals may not welcome it .
In order to command the psychology of the user , it was necessary for me to know the new trends in UI
Therefore , with a good UI design , many people will have a good user experience .
A good user experience will be good for collecting data and be good for making decisions in commerce .
Once upon a time there was a little girl living in a small town .
She was very shy , sensitive and embarrassed .
She dreamt about living in a big city where no one would know her .
She just wanted to hide from this world .
Lora grew up and became a very pretty adult .
She moved to Kyiv , graduated from university , and started to work .
Although she tried to hide , she became a great and famous model .
She had even got a boyfriend , Michael .
He was everything to her .
He loved her for her fame .
From time to time , it seemed to him that he loved her .
But it was a very brief emotion .
Once , Lora came to him and told him that she was sick .
Football is my favorite sport , so I pay more attention to it than to any other thing you might think of .
I have been following series of football events in the world at large .
I took this time to command people who sacrifice their entire lives for the betterment of sportsmanship .
With all that , I do have my favorite club , team and country as well .
My favorite club is Barcelona and my favorite country is Cameroon although I am from Liberia .
What really makes me love Barcelona is that they play football , instead of running around .
They always buy talented players that will make the club improve tactically . People always say this ; " Barcelona does n't buy players " , it 's not like they lack money .
As normal human beings , you have to know how to spend money , where , when to spend it . It 's not because you have more money then you lavish it .
The facts should not be hidden . Barcelona is the best club team in the world , whether you like it or not .
I am writing about the international sports monthly magazine I have seen .
I enjoy this sport because it is comfortable and elegant and you never hurt yourself badly .
The advice I would give to someone who is starting this sport , is ,
first of all , you should eat healthy food to have a good physique , do more exercise and sleep less .
Most people who play tennis are always ready and proud of themselves .
I reach home at 13:00 , then I have my lunch and relax for an hour .
We all know that doing sport is very important to keep our lives healthy and happy .
My favourite sport at the moment is walking , and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown .
I also like walking in public streets , gardens , clubs and on the shore . When I want to go anywhere , I do my best to go on foot .
I have liked this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about the good times when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future .
The Walking can also fitness and make the knees stronger .
It would be interesting to accompany your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time .
I advise any people who suffer from laziness and obesity to try to walk for at least one hour and after that they will like this sport .
I want to begin with one thing : I do n't have a favorite sport or anything like that , but I really like to do exercises for my body .
I think it 's important to maintain our tone and , of course , our health .
Because when we do a sport or some simple exercises we feel how the body receives energy . That is happening with me .
But we have concrete examples , which we should follow and which already demonstrate that nothing is impossible
, like Nadia Comaneci or Gica Hagi . They are two people who succeeded in their sport but with perseverance and ambition .
They are passionate about what they do . More specifically , those people are in love with their job .
It is an important thing to love or like a lot what we do , because that is the key .
The pleasure and your willpower will help you to succeed and to get the best scores .
In my opinion , this subject , sport , one 's favorite sport is one of the most pleasant for me .
I love to go jogging in the morning and then to do a lot of exercises for my legs and arms .
If I do that , now the day is one of my best days . It 's a managed day for me .
In conclusion , I do n't have a favorite sport . I like to do a little of everything and I do n't refuse anything .
This crime happened about six years ago .
It was in Italy , in Bergamo to be precise .
Yara finished one of her training sessions .
Her parents , within half an hour of the training 's end , became worried .
Then , when she did n't return home , her parents reported the disappearance of their daughter .
The investigations were concentrated above all on the construction site of Mapello .
In December 2010 , Fikri was arrested by the police .
Three month after her disappearance , she was found dead in the stream .
Definitely , public transportation does n't have any future .
A good proportion of the population prefer to buy a car to go to school , the workplace , church in a faster and more comfortable way .
Every year , thousands of cars are sold and the demand is growing .
Probably the only opportunity to change this will be to mention to people the opportunity to save energy and reduce the environmental pollution if we use public transportation .
It not only entertains , but also educates .
There are many educational programmes which we can get benefits from .
Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe . In fact , there are some important tournaments in which all important European teams participate . They are called the " Champions League " and the " Europa League " . Football is a team sport . In fact , everybody participates in this sport without excluding anybody .
People start to play football on a regular pitch . After some time , they will be tired , but it is normal because their muscles are not strong enough for running around the pitch many times .
If you train often , your muscles will become very strong .
Another thing you do not have is ball control .
. Ball control is the control you have when you run with the ball .
You can improve it by running with the ball and , gradually , you will improve your ball control .
How to make a real mistake ?
I 'll tell you a story that happened at school .
Any normal rainy day when you are a teenager in school never ever ends , but one day was a better day than any other normal rainy day because I learnt how to live as a powerful smart girl who used to let others use her because she wanted to feel needed by her friends but did not have many friends in school except " Michael " .
All my class called me creep ugly geek , but still little good only when a teacher wanted fresearch from them or the exams
were in the next couple of days , but Michael tried to stop me doing that because they never became my friends and I was better at doing those things .
That day , I had just finished helping a younger student to understand his math lesson . My friend Michael asked me to do the same and to give her an answer sheet for all the final exams . I was shocked that she wanted that from me . Anyway , I gathered up my courage and told her that was wrong and become to do that in college Better to start studying now and I 'd help her to study the hard lessons ( I was very sad to say no & that she asked me that ) . She became very angry and told me I should help her because we she was my best friend . Then I told her why I had told her NO and she said " I hate you . "
Years ago , pollution was not a big problem to deal with .
Our ancestors used to live an unselfish life .
Nowadays , pollution is a problem that we have to solve before it gets worse .
A new mode of transport must be found .
We are used to driving a car and we do not notice how much damage we cause . We should start using new ways of getting around , such as cycling or walking .
Not only will this solve pollution , it will also help us to get rid of obesity .
We should find new alternatives for getting around in our routines .
We have no idea of how much damage factories cause to the rivers and seas .
In fact , factories ' waste goes into the rivers .
The government should introduce a new law to correct this damage .
As we can see , modernization is causing damage to rivers and seas .
In my opinion , pollution is a problem in the entire world , not only in modern countries , so we should try to recycle more . Any kind of help is necessary .
Dear Grandmother ,
They are white with black and blue lines .
I love them .
My mother gave me them for my birthday .
I 'm going to celebrate my birthday next week at my house .
I am very happy because the time went very fast .
I did n't have any news about you .
You could come here when you have time because my house is your house .
While you are with me , you will do curriculum vitae and then we will travel around my country and we will become good workers .
This idea is fantastic , although it will be very complicated .
However , the best option is that you come here and then I will introduce to you my friends and their fathers , because they can help you with finding a job .
On the other hand , I do n't recommend travelling , because it is very expensive .
If you come here , you will see a lot of the country and you could travel around the world .
But it is your decision . These options are my advice .
I will look forward to your news about your decision , but I am very excited , because if you are with me , I will have the best summer of my life and I will be very happy because we will have parties with a lot of friends .
You must remember that money is very important to your decision .
And I went to open the door .
I was really comfortable in my bed and I could n't believe that someone had interrupted my calm .
But , whatever . I went .
To the door and opened it . It turned out that it was my brother .
After we said hi and I went inside with him , he told me that our mom was going on a trip for a week and we had to take care of our little sister .
I was a little worried because I love my sister but she was young and I had a lot of work .
However , I decided to say yes and prepared myself to take care of her .
My brother left and he promised to return later with my sister .
I closed the door hoping never to have to open it again , then I went to the bathroom and took a relaxing shower .
I practise the Pilates Method every Sunday morning .
I like this sport because it is a simple healthy sport that respects my body .
I practised dance a long time ago , but with age , I 've preferred to practise an easier sport .
I discovered Pilates 2 years ago and began with an old Bejar dancer .
He took time to explain each movement and made me understand the concept .
After 10 times , I obtained results in my body : stretchy , sinewy and flexible .
If I could give advice to new practitioners of Pilates , it would be to read a book about this method and to take time choosing a good teacher .
A few years ago I took part in a programme called Christmas Drama .
In my school days , I did not participate in any programme , even sports .
Because school teachers never encouraged me to participate .
If they had told me to attend compulsorily I would have done so without any hesitation .
While I am in ANDRAPRADESH every year , we have a Christmas function in December . Although we are not interested in attending Drama , they would not let us not play even a simple character .
They gave me the part of THE GOD . At first I was n't aware of how to act and play this particular character .
And from October to December we practised every day after our study hour until eleven " O"CLOCK . DAY BY DAY I learnt and finally I played my role well .
Then I asked myself why I wasted all my school days .
Personally , I believe that those who do not participate in any activities should be encouraged to do so by teachers .Only then will they also know how talented they are .
After some ages we can not attend any of this type of activity because we are all old . So let go and enjoy your youth and be happier .
The future of public transport in developed countries is very different , because most people have a car . In poor countries , most people take public transport , because people do n't have a car and it is cheaper to take public transport . The pollution caused by public transport is huge and is growing . Third world countries should have eco - friendly transport .
I did n't use to believe that people would do anything for advantage , even betray family and friends .
I thought that was only seen in films .
The real world was not like that .
I strongly believed people would rather have love in their heart than anything .
I was n't rich , not having many good things , only a simple person , but I lived happily .
At least I had a stable job , a lover , family and friends .
However , these things have changed , All the things I owned , built , remaining are broken .
It is hard to believe my eyes that I can see the greed in their eyes , as if they ca n't wait to see me dead . They ca n't become brilliant so long as I am alive .
I have always tried to convince them that I am not as bad as some people say .
My family live in the city center of Madrid but I do n't like living there because it is noisy and there is pollution , so I decided to move to the countryside two years ago .
I love this place because it is relaxing , but the only problem for me is I live alone and I 'm lonely .
My mother knew how I felt and she wanted to help me .
She came to my house with a present last week and when I opened it ... I could n't believed it . It was a beautiful little monkey !
I was so excited and very happy .
For me it was like having a new member of the family and he lived with me .
Since that moment , my life changed and now I go everywhere with " Yango " . That 's the monkey 's name .
I am writing this letter in order to apply for the job in the " USA summer camps " .
To start with , I would like to tell you that I have studied gastronomy at the Instituto Crandon , one of the most recognised institutes in Uruguay . Also , I have just finished a sports and health course at the Universidad de la Republica , on which I learned to work with people of all ages in the sports area .
I think all people love sport .
In the world , a very famous sports festival is the Olympics .
These include many kinds of sports , such as wrestling , basketball , tennis , running , etc .
My favourite sports are basketball and martial arts .
First , basketball is a team sport , which means I need to understand the expressions of members of the team and keep in contact them . For example , my role is cutter but I need to do assister , blocker and guard when I play .
Secondly , every country has its own martial arts history and culture , for example , kung fu from China , taekwondo from Japan and Karate form Korea .
It is not just fighting . These sports give people endurance , speed and power .
In particular , I like karate and Kung - fu .
Men and women are possible to interest it .
There is no special criteria , such as tall and strong muscles or gender .
These 2 sports improve basic human ability to reach the highest capability possible .
I suggest to other people to first understand yourself , such as what you like , what is possible , and then practice after every success .
My favourite sport is badminton .
It 's a game for 2 or 4 people .
They use a bat and a shuttlecock , which is like a bird 's feather .
The aim of the game is to score the most points .
I think I am a good player .
I first played badminton when I was 7 years old .
The positives of playing badminton : you can lose weight , and your vision will be good etc .
The negatives of playing badminton : your right arm is stronger than your left arm , and sometimes , you can sprain your arm .
I 'm sure it is very healthy for your body .
According to this form , we know learning knowledge takes a lot of time in one day .
Unlike Taiwan 's senior high school students , their sleeping time averages eight hours or even more .
As for me , my daily schedule does n't have much variety , just study , sleep and others .
Others includes rest and exercise , but they do n't take up lots of time .
In my awareness , I know the United States advocates free - style study and self - learning , so aside from study , they have diverse selections .
When it comes to my sleeping , I only have four to five hours a day .
The lack of sleep often makes me unable to concentrate in class .
The more I remind myself to get up early , the more things I need to do .
The only common option is rest time , I also spend three to four hours resting .
Because I think family and friends are my spirit medicine , they can give me lots of energy .
First , I want to say that people 's lives will change in the future , because the new technologies will change the lives of people .
I think this because the new technologies are created by people to improve our habits .
For example , the Internet in the next 50 years will be very different . I guess that people will have a chip in their heads and they may do many things with their minds , like if we need to call other people , we will think about it and we will be able to speak with them .
On the other hand , people make other inventions to improve the world and reduce pollution . For example , at this time we have created electric cars and organic food . These things will be very useful in the future , because we will need to reduce pollution .
Also , people will need to improve medicine to cure diseases and , for this , people need to create more inventions to resolve these problems .
Finally , I think that the best change will be in our lifestyle . We will change our clothes , thinking and other things . We will be more dependent and we will need more things for our day to day life .
Although I have had terrible jet lag since I came back to my country , it 's great to see my family and my friends .
Anyway , I have to find a bird to develop myself and take a rest .
I never said goodbye to everyone because I will come back to England .
Michael is a teenage boy who lives with his parents .
One summer tomorrow , his sister woke up very early .
He was worried because his sister always woke up very late , about midday .
Someone rang the doorbell and he opened but there was nobody at the door , so he closed the door again .
He heard a bit of noise at the top of the stairs but he did n't go to investigate that noise .
The doorbell rang again and he opened the door again . His sister was with him and she was very scared , but there was nobody at the door again .... and this time , the noise at the top of the stairs was loader and he understood everything .
Someone was ringing the doorbell while someone else was robbing their house ...
It was by that that her sister was scared and woken up ...
Twenty years ago , I started playing football .
I had played a lot of sports before , but when I started playing football , I felt that was my sport , that was freedom .
I have played for a lot of teams .
And just as I was becoming a professional football player , my right knee was injured .
Then I had to be operated on twice .
Because of injuries , I am now thinking about leaving football to dedicate myself to my other passion ; the guitar .
I prefer doing sport with a friend or my sister , it is more fun .
When you go owling you do n't need words , or worms or anything but hope .
This book was written by Jane Yolen .
I like that phrase because the boy was happy because he got to
go owling and he ' d been wanting to go owling for a long time and he finally got to go .
When other kids are happy , that makes me happy . I like it because it makes me feel good because you do n't haf't
( have to have words to go owling but you have to have hope to see an owl .
I am 24 years old and I live in Rena .
I am blonde ,
I like going to the cinema , going out with my friends ,
to playing Counter Strike , walking in the park , going shopping , and I ca n't stand the sight of blood .
I am now studying Software Engineering .
In September I am going to Madrid to study a master 's in
Web Programming with my boyfriend .
I like living with my boyfriend .
I am more romantic than my boyfriend .
What I dislike is that I will be away from my family .
They are very happy with me , because my marks are good .
Hi Jenny
Well , as you asked me Jenny , the most brilliant actor that I 've ever seen is Vin Deasel . He is an excellent professional and he starred in a great number of movies , like the saga of Fast and Furious , Ridic , Nannies , Bulletproof and other excellent films .
This is one of my favourite actors , because , when he is recording a film , he assumes his role passionately and that is really important for a good actor .
Another of my favourites is Will Smith . He appeared in the well - known film , Men in Black and other excellent films like I am Legend .
He is , for me and many people , an excellent actor because his personality is extroverted .
So Jenny , these are my two favourites film stars .
This topic is controversial these days . Should everyone take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university ?
I am going to study the topic from both sides and give my opinion on the matter .
A good percentage of people think that everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college .
They think the student can spend that year in a job to earn money so they can afford their expenses during college .
This helps them also to explore the job market ; some jobs are in great demand compared to others .
Or the student can simply spend this time travelling .
This helps them to get rid of study stress , and to give time to their social life .
Others think that if students take a year off studying it is unwise .
As returning to studying may be difficult .
It is better to finish studying first , then go to work or have relaxation with travel .
Both opinions have their merits .
In my opinion , it greatly depends on an individual 's financial situation .
If you have money that can cover your expenses on travel , it is totally different than if you have to work to cover your expenses ,
Transport is very important in our lives , because we travel from place to place .
The technology and industry are developing very fast , so public transport has no future .
It must be Interesting that the development of transport even fits the times .
Congratulations on your wedding . I hope you will be as happy as you are now your whole life .
You and Jenny are a great couple .
Thank you very much , Joe , for thinking of me to be your witness . I feel very proud that you thought of me to be your witness and , of course , I accept and I will be in Toronto for your wedding .
Joe we live far away because I work for the Red Cross , but I am still the same person as I was at school and I like the same things .
Joe , I have the same memory as I had when I was a child , and I do n't remember Sophie .
Was she at school with us ?
Could you describe her to me ?
Anyway , I have never been a witness . What do I have to do ?
Tell me what kind of suit the witness has to wear , whether I have to bay any colour of tie , a flower .... I 'm really very excited about your wedding .
I will be at home for my mother 's birthday in November , and if you can , we could have a drink .
Anyway , congratulations to you and Jenny again .
Hello , good morning .
I enjoy my favorite sport because I like running , playing and going to the forest .
This sport is healthy and good for the body . You should start this sport because you will feel good .
Your muscles will be hard .
For this sport , it is necessary to drink water , and eat fruit , vegetables and pasta .
We should n't eat sweets and sugar .
If you want to start this sport , you should start running for thirty minutes .
Thank you for showing interest in my village 's concern about the environment .
The town , Lahori , is known for its practices to preserve nature . In our town , we conduct monthly meetings concerning waste management , as well as pesticides .
We are very appreciative of Dr. Manjot Baqri , who has taken it upon himself to lead these meetings and educate our village on health problems associated with improper disposal of waste . The village has dug pits to dispose of waste .
The fact of using a car to travel , is essential in life , and that depends on the car you want to buy and save gas .
When you drive you must take precautions at all times because if you do n't you can cause an accident .
Remember that a car is to make your life easier to get around and be safe and as a way also to have security because you go in your car and you are less likely to get mugged or something .
Some disadvantages are that you may not have the money to maintain a car , and always remember that the car should give you a service and not you to it , which is why you always keep it in line with the engine , so you do not fail .
One day I visited my friend Jimmy in New York city . He was a young man who was an expert on trains and tourism . He talked about how citizens and commuters move from one place to another . He told me that Grand Central Station was the largest terminus in the city . He showed me where the landmarks of the Big Apple were so sightseers could go there . He showed me the city and we went to different parts . First he took me to Columbus Circle in the south west corner of Central Park where there were the most expensive apartments . Then we went to the lake where the jogging tracks that circle the lake are popular with early - morning visitors . Then we went to the Museum of Natural History that was located near the Metropolitan Museum of Art . Then I got focal on the subway trains , so we went to Grand Central Station . When we arrived , I was amazed to see a lot of people going to work , so he told me that it was convenient for people to use the train because it is very fast and for the government it was a great economic business . Then he told me that one of the characteristics of
In the era of technological advancement , everything goes beyond one 's expectations .
There are mobile phones which have face - to - face communication , and transportation driven by solar energy .
In addition , the transportation system which is developing day - by - day performs in the most convenient and the fastest way it can .
Even though the personal car is used more and more because of its convenience , in my opinion , unstoppable transportation development will cause public transport to be more popular than travelling by car .
The number of people in the world is continually increasing .
This makes the cities crowded .
Imagine if everyone had private cars . Would we walk on the top of the car to meet our neighbour next door ?
Therefore , public transportation is deemed important to reducing congestion on the road ; the traffic .
In the first paragraph , I wrote that transportation development will never lose place for public transport .
Firstly , there are a lot of ways to travel ; for example , buses , trolley buses , Metro , BTS , train , ship .
Secondly , public transport proves itself to be more functional and helps support people .
For example , comfortable seats , system support for the handicapped or physical disability , time capture that helps people to know the fixed time when the bus will come , as well as security support that helps people to be more confident to travel .
Lastly , public transportation makes you sure to arrive on time .
You do not worry about traffic jams , or trying to find the car park .
Taking into account all this , public transport is much more useful and convenient , both for individuals and for businesses .
Although the personal car is popular , public transport is still valuable to the country .
Hope you will be free at 6 a.m.
Let 's meet at John 's apartment .
A summer vacation is so desirable that those in school or work long for it .
To most students , the weekend is essential for them , because they are not allowed to play computer games until the weekends .
In my opinion , the weekend not only gives us enough time to take an adequate break , but allows us to enrich ourselves .
Similarly , summer vacation gives us more time to do meaningful things .
Such as visiting museums , seeing touching movies , doing exercise and so on .
Only by constantly following my daily routine can I learn more information and become stronger .
In important meetings like the UN General Assembly or G77 , many leaders of powerful countries raise environmental problems as the most concerning problem in their internal policies .
Disasters in the environment not only cause many problems for humans but also to all the diversity of life .
As a part of this diversity , people , therefore , seek ways to reduce the causes and effects of these coming disasters .
Firstly , I sometimes use my mom 's bicycle to go to university , taking part in reducing the carbon dioxide emissions from my car .
Riding a bicycle is also a kind of eco - friendly mode of transportation .
Next step , I reduce using some of the cosmetic products that contribute to or are made from materials that cause the greenhouse effect .
I am writing to tell you that I ca n't run the marathon with you , because the distance is too great for me . I 'm not fit enough for that .
I'm sorry . Maybe next year I can go .
Last week I saw a bike trip to the countryside and how about registering for that ?
I really think that we should speak English .
I do n't know how to study English and for this reason it is very difficult for me .
Next year , in October , I 'll go as an au pair to Oxford , where I hope to learn English .
Yes , I 'm talking with a family in Oxford .
I love this family because it is a single mother and I think it is easier .
Yes , I 'm talking with a family in Oxford .
I should go in October , for 7 months .
I love this family because it is a single mother and I think it is easier .
I believe that I could be a good helper for two reasons .
First , I am good at cooking .
I was working in ABC restaurant until last year .
Besides , I am also good at dealing with people .
For more information about my qualifications please see the attachment .
Best regards , and I look forward to hearing from you .
The video game Counter Strike is a good game for the computer . I think that playing it is a good way to enjoy yourself .
In this video game , you can kill , jump , dance , and eat all you want . It is a very good game . I think that it is the best " shooter " and that " Arctic Combat " is good too .
I am a very good player at this . I know to how play it very well .
Summer holiday
I went to Italy on holiday 3 years ago .
I did n't have a long holiday . It was just for 3 days , but those 3 days were the best in my life .
I must say that I went there because my sister is living there , so I did n't have to book a room at a hotel and spend too much money .
I went to the Vatican and Rome . I saw their massive buildings , which were impressive , and their old houses .
The weather was fantastic . I love sunbathing and resting on the hot sand on the beach .
I am Melody Martinez . I 'm 26 years old . I was born in Mexico .
One of my passions in this world is helping people , any kind of people ; old , disabled , poor people and kids .
I think I am a suitable person to care for children , because I like working with kids . It is not the first time I have worked with children .
I 'm good at improvising games for children , and I 'm a good cook too .
If you only give me the opportunity to work for the camp , I will not disappoint you .
He took his backpack and ran really fast to school .
Today is the big day , the day of his presentation about acid rain and its consequences on the environment .
Peter had studied and prepared himself for this day for a very long time , because finally , his mother would see him after four years apart .
Health is an important part of our lives , so our priority in our city is the environment , and people consider keeping our environment clean and work together for the preservation of the environment .
Therefore , the municipality put in place regulations and instructions to take care of our village .
Firstly , organizing collecting garbage . for example , red box for medical rubbish , because it is dangerous , it is toxic materials , yellow box for plastic , white box for glass , and pink box for other trash .
This facilitates classification of garbage and transfers each sort of rubbish to a specific place .
Secondly , recycling waste . After collecting it , they then transport it to factories to recycle it into useful materials we can use again in all aspects of our lives .
Lastly , workshops about conservation of the environment to increase environmental awareness among people , to encourage them to take care of their city , and teach them how they can recycle some rubbish to make useful objects to use at home .
In addition , many residents in our town have launched initiatives which target cleaning up our village , and planting a lot of trees on the streets to keep the environment clean and protect our generation from pollution . In addition , to attract tourists to visit us . As a consequence , increasing the number of visitors to our town , and reducing pollution which causes various diseases .
Furthermore , this saves on the cost of treatment because of the decreasing number of patients .
In conclusion , we look forward to our village being free from pollution and keeping our health and enjoying fresh air where our children will grow up .
Dan was a runner of the big leagues who wanted to get the world record of the best time for the 100 m .
To achieve his goal , he trained a lot with one of his colleagues and he gave no importance to the judgements that people had about him and his ambitious desire for victory .
Although he was always wondering if it was a blessing or a lesson I be competing .
Either way , he had an enemy who was trying to extinguish his love of running and get him out of the competition .
The enemy thinks that the passion to run of Dan will decrease , but she does n't take into account , that this love will be forever in his heart to fight with any adversity in his way .
At the end , he continues running . Thanks to this , he achieved his goals .

I have liked swimming since I was young , and when I grew up , I told my mum that I wanted to compete in competitions .
The first time , it 's difficult , like any other sport , because you do n't know and you have to improve by yourself , but if you like it , you will find it fascinating .
Also , I remember my first competitions . I did n't win . I came 4th , but I was n't sad because I thought that the next time I would do my best and probably I would win .
I went swimming 4 hours a week and it was amazing , because I improved a lot and , right now , I 'm one of the best .
Last year I won the national competition in my country and that makes me feel so good , because it 's all I want .
If you want to take up swimming , I would recommend you to do your best and if you like it you will enjoy it at the same time as you are doing exercise .
In the past , most people did not worry about their healthy .
These days , almost 80% of people have assured feel concerned about their bodies and their diet . Because of this , they promised me that they will try to improve their daily diet and they will do sport more frequently .
Like most people , we started to do sport because we were stressed and needed to get out of our house after a hard day of work or study .
One day , I went running and since that moment I have not stopped .
The perfect moment is whenever you want ; in the morning , in the afternoon , in the evening , or in the night .
It is true that in summer we have to be careful about with te hours are too hot and we should avoid running .
It is necessary to buy well - made sneakers , to make sure you do n't suffer a pain in your feet and the rest of your body .
In Tampico City the most important landmarks are the squares in Tampico . The best shopping centres are mall Altama ubicate in Tampico center and the beach Madero . The most important parks are Carpenter 's lagoon and my favorite restaurant is Child 's in mall Altama .

Here I come to express my thoughts about what has been happening during these past weeks in the reception of the building .
I am happy to say that I have only positive points to present due to how welcome I feel when I arrive at the reception .
Because of that , sometimes I feel free to ask them what I want and depending on the way they receive my comments I can just let them do the task I asked them without keeping on watching them .
In conclusion , I 'd like to offer my help if anything is necessary .
Myths and fables are always my favorite types of stories , because they can either be easy to understand or extend to deeper matters .
Sometimes it is interesting to know a story by discovering its background first , is n't it ?
For example , due to the wide spread of " The Epic of Gilgamesh " , we have all heard something relating to it , but do n't really know about any details .
Therefore , I am trying to find out more information about " The Epic of Gilgamesh " in order to understand it completely .
In conclusion , I hope that Riyadh city will be more interested in traffic jams .
If the government pays attention to improving the streets , decreases the use of cars , provides other transportation , and controls traffic jams by using police , Riyadh will become a great city so the people wo n't worry about going out .
My name is Andreia . I am 27 years old . I am a very friendly person and I have experience in this area .
Last summer , I worked with children aged 10 years old for a month and I organised some activities on the beach , such as football games and gym classes .
I like cooking very much and I think that there are some activities that we could do in the kitchen , like baking cookies or making fresh bread .
For another think I can speak English very well , because I studied English at university although I am Portuguese .
In the future , this tendency will continue and there will be more and more specific social networking sites between business and personal life .
In order for this to happen , looking out for new social networking sites designed for our particular goals .
Taking the place of general networks like you find on Facebook , you will find sites are specializing and aimed at individuals , businesses and society .
Using cars to fulfill our transportation needs within the city limits is a very good option for many of us . However , the necessity of travelling overseas or even outside of our suburban areas might require a different sort of transportation . Therefore , this is where public transportation should be focussed since long trips taking longer than a simple commute in the city would require it .
It has been a popular American tradition for many years now , since the mid-60s that we all use cars owned by private parties in order to meet our needs . Hence , it has been considered the " modus operandi " ever since .
A new thinking might help to address this issue : transportation itself , perhaps , is in need of evolution . That might be the use of public transportation , it has proven to be the best means to get to places the roads and geographical areas of which might happen to be unknown to the traveller .
Firstly , everyone can buy a lot of types of things in my city . For example , in the centre of the city , we can buy souvenirs , because this town has got old monuments , theatres and churches .
In the north of the city , people sell all types of food .
Normally , this food is made when people did in the past , although the best street market is in the west of the city .
On the other hand , you should visit a bookshop in a street market .
However , you can read a book while you eat and drink some things on the sofa of street .
You must remember that in the center of the city , you can visit the bakeries with the best sweets and bread in the world and these sweets are cheaper than in other towns .
Finally , people can visit the biggest shopping center in Spain . The location of this shopping center is on national street 445 in the west of the city .
You can see modern clothes while you eat in a restaurant and you can take photos of TV stars , because they shop in this shopping center and you feel like a star , because you see a famous person and you think that you are in a film .
The movie I have decided to review for you is a thriller called The Destiny .
The plot of the movie is set in a small town where everything has its own eyes and because of that you must be aware of your behaviour .
It all begins when a daughter comes to visit her mother and her step - father .
What I liked most was that you think you know what is going to happen , but to your surprise , it always turns out to be something unexpected .
Despite the fact that there is n't any Hollywood star , all the characters are played very believably and some scenes wo n't let you sleep .
Even the scenery is not based on a real story . It will make you think about accidents happening around you .
There is n't anything special that I disliked , except maybe for the music which was used .
Sometimes I felt that the background songs did n't match with what was happening , but after all you are in expectations of next step so you would n't mind it .
I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see unpredictable situations happening and likes the feeling of the unknown .
The town is called White City .
It is a quiet and beautiful city with many things to do and a lot of places to go .
My favourite place is the beach that is near , just about 20 miles away from my flat .
In toward to the modernization of life and technology , people believe in different perspectives of their way of life , but the majority of ones are totally utopian .
Everyone wants particular objects and individual life , as an egoistic human being . However , the real world hasn't got the capacity to support these ideas .
Actually , we have a lot of problems with traffic : lots of carriages on the railway and they are n't running ; the number of cars in the street causes pollution ; crowded railways cause a late arrival .
In the biggest cities around the world , the traffic is nonstop and increasing every day .
We discover , in this context , special diseases caused by traffic : stress , violence , pollution , lack of safety , and so on .
For this reason , I believe that in the future we will return to using green fuels and public transport .
If public transport were of higher quality , faster and with lower fares , the majority of citizens would prefer it : it is calmer to relax and read a newspaper or a magazine during the journey on mass transport than in individual transport ; moreover , the time spent to go and come back would be reduced , because it promotes fewer carriages on the railway .
Thus , in the future , public transport will be more attractive than private and individual transport .
In the morning , we went to Ocean Park , we saw dolphins , cats , horses and many other animals . In the afternoon , we went on the roller coaster . I screamed at the top of my voice and called for help . Actually , I hate riding on roller coasters . We played mind train , punch , and a lot of other games . At the end of the day I was running out of gas , because I was too tired to walk any further .
On the last day , I gave her a photo that was our first hang out and we hugged each other . She gave me a present and asked me to keep it for her .
Nowadays , students have a lot of different forms of education . They may not only learn in school but also through the Internet .
It has both advantages and disadvantages .
The main advantage of learning on the Internet is saving time .
When we attend a school we often waste time on buses which we could devote to studying .
In the case of Internet learning , we can set one 's own hours of learning .
Also , the possibility of learning at home is a big advantage , especially for people who prefer peace and silence .
Then it 's better to concentrate on learning and we do n't feel any pressure or stress connected with questions and tests .
On the other hand , learning on the internet in the long term we could feel bored or lonely . School gives opportunities for learning in groups when students can help each other and solve problems .
Another disadvantage of learning on the Internet can be problems with the Internet connection .
It does not always work correctly .
Malcolm Young is a guitarist who , with his brother , founded the rock band , AC / DC .
He has never been the most famous guitarist in the world . He was just one more guitar player .
He has lived in the shadow of his brother , the leader guitarist and one of the most important guitarists ever .
However , he has never thought of this as a problem .
He just does his job , plays guitar and sings as the second voice .
But if you research about what he has done for AC / DC , you realize that he was an important man .
A lot of AC / DC 's songs were written and composed by him .
He has been AC / DC 's mind .
But why did I write this article about someone who seems to be a simple guitarist . The reason is just one : the life of this man who one day just disappeared from the fans ' sight .
On April 2014 he was unable to give a performance .
On September 2014 , a note was released and published on AC / DC 's web page . The note said : " Malcolm is taking a break from the band due to ill health " .
Dementia is an illness that affects the brain ; people 's memories are lost . Malcolm does n't remember who the people around him are .
The video showed us dementia sufferers ' reaction to listening to AC / DC 's music .
At the end we read a sentence : " Although you might someday forget about the world , the world will never forget you , Malcolm , "
Live you only have one life , today . Perhaps tomorrow you will lose everything .
My name is Samy .
I'm a 22-year - old Egyptian .
I thought that it was the best sport ever .
It taught me the meaning of teamwork and leadership .
I kept playing basketball continuously for 4 years , till I went to secondary school .
My advice to anyone starting basketball is to never give up and always keep playing till the last minute .
We are not alone . We live with people who are family for us .
Relationships can be very different .
From the best to the worst .
But sometimes we start to call our sisters and brothers our enemies without any reason .
Who brings us up ?
Who cares about us ?
Who tries to make us happy ?
Of course not .
Our family are people who will love us , and who do n't look at situations and who we are .
We are always small and careless children to our parents , small and foolish to our elder brothers and sisters .
And I can clearly say that they are our friends . We are part of them and they are part of us .
Television and other things invented by technology are part of our lives .
I think every family has got a television in their own home and , for example , I have 4 televisions in mine .
For me , television has advantages and disadvantages .
It 's important if we want to know news about our country or world news .
There are a lot of interesting TV programs where we can learn something and there are also intriguing television programs .
These are advantages , but we can also have disadvantages from them .
For example , we can become addicted to our television .
It is not the best thing for our eyesight and our health .
In general , I think our technology is not the best thing for our health and TV and other similar things are responsible for our problems with health and eyesight .
So , television has positive and negative aspects and it 's up to us how to behave with it .
To keep our minds well and healthy , we need to spend some time on sport .
I like cricket . It is the best of all the sports . Cricket is a good mind - refreshing game .
After calling the ambulance , he waited outside his car for someone who could help him .
He picked up the phone and dialled the number of his girlfriend , Lisa .
They had a car accident , and fortunately he was n't injured , but his friend Sam was unconscious .
He tried to stop some cars that passed on the street , but it was useless .
Sam was visited but beside the shock , he only had some bruises .
He went with him to the hospital and in the end it was a success story .
I live in the beautiful city of Siena , which is famous for its landscapes .
If you come to Siena , there are a number of shops you should visit .
She is an only child , so she does n't have any brothers or sisters , but she has two lovely cousins called Daniel and Mariano .
Her two best friends are Laura Gorritz and me ( Maria Rodr√≠guez ) . She is great friends with Carlota Pedralba , and as well as best friends , she has some enemies .
Laura , Adriana and me ( Mar√≠a ) love being a little bit cheeky , in a good way .
Adriana does n't like sleeping , that is one of the things I have in common with her .
One of her favourite things to do is drawing . She has lots and lots of special pens , crayons , highlighters , paint .... As you see , she is good at drawing .
She says she is n't good at maths , even though she likes it .
Swimming is very exciting .
Even if you do n't know how to swim , you will love it .
There are a lot of swimming pools in Hong Kong . People love to swim with their families , friends or their children .
People in Hong Kong love to go cycling in the holidays , too .
Some people usually do cycling for relaxation .
People like cycling along the river .
I 'm going to visit your hotel from June 6 to June 24 .
So would you please reserve a room for me where no animals have lived before ?
I ca n't go to the barbecue next Sunday because I 'm going to Seville with my parents and I 'm coming back so late .
The last mistake that I made has to have been when I changed telephone companies , because , since I changed , I have had a lot of problems .
All companies are the same , any solve your problems .
I have had to make a claim because the company did n't resolve my problems .
After a month , I did n't know when I would receive my telephone .
All this began because the first telephone that I received was faulty .
The company had to send me another telephone . That telephone turned out to be faulty too .
Since that moment , I 've had nothing but problems .
Now , I have to wait for an answer from the company .
My favourite sport is handball . I have played it every day since class 4 .
I really like it because this is not a game in which you only play with a ball .
It is really exciting and amazing .
In this game you must play with a team .
You must n't play alone , but you must play with a team .
My first handball match was in class 5 .
I remember , because we won .
On starting , I was really bored and I wanted to stop playing .
But when I understood how much happiness this game gives me , I started more running and training .
The trainer said to me that I was really good .
These words made me start more
If you 'd like to try playing handball , you must know that the first time is always the worst .
But you must n't
not believe in yourself .
This is my advice for anyone who would like to play any game .
Before starting to talk about the members of my family and if they are my best friends or not , I just want to say that my family is the thing I love most in my life . I respect them , appreciate them also , and I think they are the best thing in my life .
The family member I love most and think is my best friend , is my sister . She is older than me by about 12 years . I can tell her anything about my life , myself , my feelings , I also think if I fell in love , she would be the first to know .
About the rest of my family , as I said before , they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends , I do love them so much . The first one is my aunt , the dead one , and the other one is still alive . But I do n't feel that feeling of love towards my uncle . I do love him , but he is just my uncle , no more .
Finally I want to talk about my cousins . I love most of them , especially the cousins of the same age . They are my friends . I love them so much , and also the rest of my family .
I would like to inform about correction of my family name in the result sheet .
I have already checked my family name with student services last Friday , 20 November .
My family name is WONGWATJANAKUL but the result sheet is WONGWATJANAKAKUL , which is incorrect .
Could you please correct my family name .
If you have further questions , please feel free to contact me . I would be grateful if you would let me know as soon as possible .
Sport is very important for our bodies . It has many benefits to improve ourselves and give us self - confidence , so we should practise any sport we love because it can change our minds for the better .
About me . I like playing volleyball and I enjoy this sport when I play it because of its being useful for my body .
Look for a sport to make you feel good and your brain will always be refreshed , so that you can begin your day with any sport to make fresh and after that you can do any job with a refreshed mind .
The benefits of any sport make your health good , so we should do it . Just do exercise every morning to make your blood flow in your whole body .
He is an athletic runner who has set a new global record . Nobody believes in him , not the media nor his own father .
When he was just about crossing the finishing line , he got hurt and his muscles were dying and started to peel off a black matter . At that point , the guys in suits thought that he would n't be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running . They froze the time and ran after him . He stopped for a moment , but then he started running again and when he crossed the line he woke up in a red somber fluid . He was wiped from the matrix . He opened his eyes and saw a flying robot , suddenly he was in a wooden wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again . Despite that , he stood up and tried to walk again .
My favourite sport is basketball .
I like this game very much . It is a very useful game . It helps me to keep fit . I started playing basketball many years ago . I want to be a very famous basketball player .
basketball needs a person to be tall enough to play it . I like basketball because it makes me happy , fit , gives me self - confidence and makes me active . If someone wants to play basketball , he should do a lot of exercises and try to be able to play it , because everything is difficult at first , but he should n't give up .
There was an island that each year in a particular month suffered a hurricane . This island is located on the equator . People go to this island these days but they ca n't go when there is a hurricane , because they could die in the hurricane .
The island was flooded but the island had a levee that prevented flooding . Then after many years , an engineer started constructing a building to have more money than in the city . He put many advertisements on all things : balls , balloons , movies , etc .
The engineers needed help to construct the building . They called a professional to see what was wrong .
Then the professional said that the island has expose with the ocean .
Then the engineers called another sector to ensure the doubt about Atlantis . Then the professional said that the other professional was correct .
Then the engineers made a forecast .
Then they drank a coffee that give them a lot of energy to construct the building faster . This coffee has an ingredient so that people can live all night .
Then he worked all night to finish the next month .
First , one elevator did n't function . Then they had a fight to find who was to blame for the elevator .
Then tourists went to this building to find jobs to earn money .
Then the hurricane came and all the people were scared because they did n't know what they were going to do .
The people did n't know that this was a cycle , because the engineers did n't tell them about this hurricane .
But the engineer ignored this situation . Then a helicopter came to save the residents .
This helicopter had humid .Then the helicopter started to rotate in the whole island . Then the helicopter sank in the water . Then the hurricane ended and the engineers started to distribute food and medicine .
Then the engineers discovered that the eye of the hurricane was widespread all over the island and that the island was a hemisphere . Then in the city , qualify to the people that work in this building .
When I started to study here in Australia , I found the difference in curriculum compared to my home country .
In my home country , when I was at university , it has quite easy for me to follow the educational policies .
The learning style is a traditional learning style that is usual in my country .
" In particular , many international students are too teacher dependent and uncritical of material that have been thought , prone to role memorization , they misunderstand the cardinal sin of plagiarism , and lack knowledge of the genres of academic writing " .
In contrast , in my present learning , it is absolutely crucial .
The academic style is more about critical thinking , and it is hard to cope , because I need to understand it using their language .
Clearly , multiple factors have had major influences on the nature of the student population attending universities and how this shift affects , and is affected by , university policy and practiced are important issues .
As an international learner , I embraced these changes in my learning strategies , primarily because these new learning strategies of academic style are important for my future course .
It has challenged me to adapt to a universal approach to the learning style back in my country .
Julia 's anecdote is not a fact , but fiction .
It 's a bookseller called " A droga da obedi√™ncia " whose author is Brazilian .
The story is about five friends that begin investigating drug trafficking happening inside a school .
However , one friend disappears , then the four friends decide to discover where he is .
It 's a mystery story with a moral , because to the reader 's surprise , the headmaster was the drug dealer that produced the drug in the classes .
The moral is about students not being na√Øve and being careful of unscrupulous men that sell drugs .
I heard you are going to come to my country .
In Poland we have a lot of interesting places to visit .
Places that you can visit : mountains , sea and lakes .
We have a lot of nice old towns .
Poland is an amazing and interesting country .
If you have working in Poland , the best way is job on holiday .
If you have experience of cooking , you will be the right person for this job .
I have a dream to continue my studies to PhD level .
However , I think that it is not an easy thing to achieve because of the limited information about scholarships .
In addition , I work as a civil servant who should follow the government rules .
Actually , I do n't give up and always look for opportunities .
In my opinion , education is a way to improve our quality of life .
In other words , it can change our paradigm and mindset to better perspectives .
In the broader capacity , it can help my nation 's position in the world .
Therefore , I do not try to suppress my ambition .
Everything is possible as long as we make an effort .
Travelling is an essential in everybody 's life .
Although the number of cars is increasing day by day , most people travel via public transport . Their limited income restricts their ability to buy cars .
Also , the main drawback of cars is environmental pollution .
Therefore , public transport has its own importance .
In order to avoid environmental pollution , people should use public transport . That will not only help to reduce the pollution , but also the extra expenditure on petrol .
The government should focus on the improvement of public transport and must discourage individual cars .
I 'm going to buy a DVD of ' Frozen ' .
In my country , weddings are celebrated from Spring to Autumn .
People wear special clothes .
If the wedding is in the morning , women wear short dresses whereas , if the wedding is in the afternoon , women wear long dresses .
You can have several dishes , such as fish , meat , seafood and a large cake .
My advice for travelling in Spain is that there are several types of transport but the most economical is public transport , the most expensive transport is a taxi , for example .
But , you can travel by plane . It is not very expensive .
My advice for finding work is a bit complicated because , nowadays , there are a lot of people without work .
But you could be lucky , because the summer is very near and the work increases .
You can find work , since you have learned English , in a bar , in a hotel , etc .
Well , I wish you all the best and that you find work .
Good luck !
From David .
I had been waiting for that day for a long time . It was my wedding day .
In the sprinter , he proposed to me in Cordoba , so I excitedly accepted .
I had met my boyfriend 5 years ago , so I was sure that it was the most important day of my life .
It was an exciting day , all my friends , family ‚Ä¶ were with me .
My boyfriend became my husband .
He was very handsome and he sang a magnificent song for me .
These days , he is a good husband , and I 'm sure that he loves me very much .
My work was reserving tickets for the customers .
I am looking forward to hearing from you about how you spent your summer .
Hi , My name is Gabriela Cordeiro Magalhaes ... I am thirteen years old .
I like playing games and reading .
My best friend is Jennifer Giordano . She 's pretty and smart .
I would recommend Huang Ji Huang to host our farewell dinner .
Huang Ji Huang is located in the popular district in North Jakarta which many people call PIK .
This a is China - based chain that has recently opened .
This restaurant had received many awards in China before it opened in Jakarta .
The building of Huang Ji Huang is pretty big if you compare it with the other restaurants in PIK .
The place has a private room and a karaoke room in one place .
Besides that , the public room is also clean and comfortable , but I recommend you to choose the private room to accommodate our farewell dinner .
The waiters who work here are kind and helpful , they serve the customers kindly and always explain the menu clearly , they are able to make their customers satisfied with the service .
Huang Ji Huang specialize in a stew pots menu , which will allow you to enjoy authentic Chinese food .
You can order a set menu that Huang Ji Huang offers or you can also choose the ingredients that you want for your stew pot , but you must choose 3 to 5 ingredients .
Huang Ji Huang has 5 kinds of sauce which can make your stew pot tasty , and one of them is Mala Sauce .
But if you do not like spicy , you can also try the Honey Sauce .
After all the food is very tempting to try and the size of a portion is big enough to share with 3 or 4 people .
The price is cheap if you take into account the service and the taste of the food .
Having a farewell dinner here is worth the money .
Every month , Huang Ji Huang always have a special offer for their customers , and for this month Huang Ji Huang will give a 20% discount to customers who spend 500 IDR or more , for complete information you can check on the website or call the restaurant .
And I highly recommend you to make a reservation first if you decide to hold our dinner here , because this place is always crowded and we also need a private room .
I'm thinking about what kind of things were more dangerous for me . It was very dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river .
When I remember that moment , I am excited .
I guess every child wants to investigate the world .
What kind of risks they can run if they do that .
Nuclear energy is one of most important sources to generate energy and heat for the people in the world .
The countries attempt to develop the nuclear industry to produce more power .
There are many views about using the nuclear power .
Some people think nuclear power has great value to produce power compared to fossil fuels , such as coal and oil , which are not renewable energy .
Moreover , they think that controlling pollution is possible .
The serious side of nuclear power is the dangerous weapons that countries try to own , which threaten the peace in the world .
These kinds of weapons do not kill one or ten , but destroy a large town completely .
In my opinion , using nuclear power is important for the great development in human life . Countries have to establish this energy and other sources to secure power for people .
I am writing to tell you about something that for sure you will love .
Yesterday , I was surfing the Internet and found an amazing site www.bargainstime.com .
I saw a colorful pop - up ad and I decided to check it out .
There were so many trendy clothes at attractive prices .
Immediately , I did some shopping there . I bought a pair of skinny blue jeans and a tight black dress .
The material is of good quality and the clothes look the same as on the page .
This is a big plus but the waiting time for delivery is quite long .
I know that you are looking for a wedding dress and I saw a lot of wonderful items on this page .
I think you will like it just like me .
I hope it will help you .
In 2009 , Michel lived in New York with his girlfriend , Ann , in their own apartment .
He worked a lot , arrived late from his work and never had time to be with Ann .
But they were in love and they decided that they would get married in 2010 .
Everything was organized .
Ann decided that she 'd try on her wedding dress
There is a tradition that the man must n't see
his bride before the wedding day .
Michel arrived home earlier that day , and when he opened his door , he saw
The fastest option for going on holidays
By plane , you rarely have problems with your luggage .
By train , you do n't always have room for your luggage .
By plane , you can hand your luggage in at the check - in or you can take the hand luggage with you . You can always be sure that you will find a place for your luggage .
Another reason why travel by plane is my favourite is because it is more comfortable to sleep unless you have a loud person close to you .
That can be annoying .
I think travel by boat is one of the worst ways to travel if you get seasick .
You can eat small pieces of different dishes and have dinner or lunch inexpensively .
For more than thirty years , in Nerja has been openend every day " Big Fish " , a traditional restaurant with the typical cuisine of the coast of M√°laga .
With your drink , the first portion is on the house .
If you pay between one and three euros , you can choose little dishes of fresh fish and different types of salads .
The portion of prawns is very famous , as is the octopus salad , which is known by everyone .
The service is very organised and fast . Although it might be high season , you will not have to wait a long time .
This restaurant only has one little problem .
You can eat " tapas " at the counter or at small tables near the bar .
The rest of the dining room is exclusively for eating meals .
Discussions about genetic manipulation become heavy when a specific area is mentioned : genetically modified food or GM food .
For several decades , the population has been discussing arguments for and against GM food .
Improving human nutrition and agriculatural conditions are arguments of those who are in favour of manipulation .
In the first quarter , we can see that sales rose . In the second quarter , sales went up , but in the third quarter , sales were unchanged .
In conclusion , we can see that sales went up every time except the third quarter when they were unchanged .
This is good , because sales never went down .
My favourite sport is football . I love it .
I enjoy playing it , particularly because it is a competitive sport and because you play with a team and not alone , and this , for me , is really important .
The thing I like best about football is playing it , but I also like watching it . In fact I am a fan of the team Lazio .
Some people think that football is a bad thing because the footballers are all stupid and the fans are all violent and disrespectful , but it is n't like that .
OK , there are some fans who are n't good people , but the major football associations are trying to stop them and to abolish all bad things in football .
For all the people , I advise you to start playing or watching football , because , for me , it is a very good sport . But you can only play football well if you really like it , because , first and foremost , football is fun .
Like every year , on the twenty - third of April , the day of the book , in my school all the students in the fifth and sixth years of primary school do a short story competition and the winner gets a prize .
The prizes are usually a book and a ticket to the theme park in Madrid , and the children who have participated win a book .
Always the director of my school , who is called Michael , is the one who organizes this event so that the children can have fun writing their short stories .
But this year , Michael organized it very badly because he did n't have enough books for all the children and a lot of them did n't get a prize , so Michel closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
I think my town really takes care of the environment , because there are a lot of parks in this town and they are very clean .
However , some people do not care about the environment . That means some people throw garbage away in the park .
I think almost everyone loves parks , because a lot of people go to the park and have lunch , picnic , do exercise , nap etc .
I think after eating something in the park cleaning up after themselves is good .
However , not everyone does that , so how much the public authorities care about the environment is important and this town cares about that a lot .
Every morning , some people come the to park and clean . up That makes us feel really grateful .
When I am walking around here I can see a lot of beautiful gardens and the roads are clean , so I think many people care about the town as well .
There are many sports grounds , for example , tennis courts , football pitches and play equipment for children , so I think my town takes care of the environment . That means everyone will be able to the in be best condition in both mind and body a for long time .
In particular , there are a lot of green areas . These makes good health .
However , someone has to take care of them .
The town has to do that and I think in England there are so many green areas all around , so a lot of people take care of these and that creates a good environment .
After I went to live in England with my family , I have goton the feel very much indeed .
Pain and Gain
This movie is based quote unquote on a " true story " , but obviously director Michael bay known for the transformers franchise puts a lot of Hollywood into this movie . It 's about a bodybuilder named Daniel Lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his property , which obviously is not a great plan that backfires on him , and eventually the police get him .
It 's a great funny movie , especially for someone like me who enjoys going to the gym and lifting some weights .
It is a very beautiful T - shirt because I like the colour and the pattern .
We saw a lot of sights , like Big Ben , which is the biggest clock in the world , and the London Eye .
To get to Big Ben , we took the underground , but to get to the London Eye , a red bus .
After 3 days we came home .
Sport is very important for everyone .
Old people and young people benefit from sports .
I like it very much . I play it at a club .
I play it with my friends .
If you score a lot of points , you will win the match .
Generally , sports are growing our minds continuously .
I play it with my friends .
My parents always support me playing what I like and
It makes me lose weight easily without making any effort .
I do n't find any difficulty doing it .
Usually I only play basketball at school .
We play in teams or each one alone .
Of course , we do n't have 2 million balls for each student . No , we share with each other .
Also , not all the school play at one time so every section has time to play .
At school I always play with friends and never play alone and my friends and I always win .
Last time I played we won 14 to 5 .
Do you know why I enjoy my sport ? I will tell you why . Because when you play you have fun and interested .
My advice for people who are starting this sport is to practise playing until they get it .
My favourite soap opera is " Friends " . I remember watching it at home at the age of twelve and laughing out loud with my brother .
My favourite character is Joey , who is a silly , innocent man .
He lives with Chandler , opposite Monica and Rachel 's flat .
It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our lives . Families definitely play an essential role in society . According to the experts , we ca n't create a successful society without creative families , and another specific part of our lives is good partners surrounding our daily activities .
One of the main advantages of family is the recognition you are given at a specific age . Children require special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family . For instance , homeless children are more likely to fail in their education or job and not adapt to society .
Consequently , they probably fail to experience from their lives .
Moreover , families play an essential part in protecting their members from bad atmosphere , and it probably reflects on their performance toward country , leading to effective , creative and useful civilians .
The last film I watched was " The Others " . It is a horror / suspense movie . I was really scared .
It is about a family ( a mother and her two children , Nicholas and Anne ) . The mother is crazy and thinks her children are allergic to the light in general .
So the does n't go outside in the day , and in a room there can not be more than one candle at a time ; it has to always be dark in the house .
Strange things happen in the house . There are " intruders " in the house ; Anne saw many times someone called Victor who " plays "
and the mother thinks she is lying . But after a while , she believes her and starts searching for the intruders .
At the end , the intruders turn out to be ghosts that


I think nowadays it is more common that people use their car for their normal activities , but the statement that there is no future for public transportation it is not completely true . I think that a lot of people use public transportation because it is cheaper and some people do n't have enough money to buy a car .
Another reason is that , here in Mexico , in some cities , you ca n't use your car on specific days , so if you do not have another car , you have to use public transportation .
Well , my college has an organization called Enactus .
I 'm a member of it and its goal is to improve the positivity of our society by setting up projects that serve many people who really need our help .
So , we have actually done 8 projects since I joined and I had a good feeling through helping other people .
We entered 2 national competitions in 2 years and won second place for one of our projects and gained 2 leagues for other ones .
We made our university proud , plus we helped people .
Now , there are over 180 members in this organization and the number is increasing .
We need more of this type of organization across the world and there are a lot of students ready to help and wishing for a chance to make our society a better place .
Nowadays , ways of life have been changing in many ways .
Does why , it is easy to believe that if things continue at this pace and transforming everything , in the near future , in 50 years , everything is going to be completely new and different .
In the past , people used to live in the moment without concern about the future .
The lives of everybody were the same and just some of them thought that what they were doing in that moment would have consequences in the future .
Because of that , everything was kind of similar and static for many years .
But then industrialization came and , with that , technology , so ways of life started to change and everything started to go faster .
As I said before , because of technology , many things have become possible in less time , and with the passage of the years , this has tended to increase .
For example , sharing knowledge and experiences means that everybody can do or apply things and develop faster .
It also means that research can be shared easily or , for example , you can get information about environmental problems that can affect you as well , so you can react faster and make some changes .
Another example of why lives are going to change completely in 50 years is because , also , that connection with other cultures makes people more concerned about their own health , their expectations of life and the way they want to live it , because every day it will be easier to see how much we are hurting the earth , so we will see faster the impacts that this has on our lives .
As a result , we will need to change fast , to try to fix what we have broken and start to rebuild in order to have that future or health that we dream of .
Last but not least , family perception , has been changed and for that time everything will be different because it will be the effect of the decisions that women are making right now about having kids .
They are tending to work as much as men , so it is hard to have time for building a family or even sometimes it is hard , too , thinking about getting married .
As a result , maybe there wo n't be a young workforce in 50 years and people will spend all their time and money on their hobbies , sports , self care and traveling .
I studied in Kuwaiti schools . After that I went to Damascus university , the faculty of human medicine . I graduated from it in 2008 with a very good grade , then I got the Master 's degree in laboratory medicine from the same university ( Ministry of Higher Education ) in 2013 with an Excellent grade .
Then I returned to Kuwait , to stay at home till I find work or get a chance to continue my higher education ( doctorate ) ....
Now I 'm working in voluntary positions , like translation , editing in Wikipedia & others .
Traveling on public transport can be cumbersome and quite eventful .
Talk of getting to meet strangers who may turn out to be thieves .
That is why I feel traveling in your own car is the best thing that can happen to a person .
On the one hand , society is becoming increasingly fat and some kinds of warnings could be useful to remind them to eat healthily .
On the other hand , it 's hard to implement this idea .
The companies who produce products with harmful ingredients are very powerful , so that this suggestion is very hard to enforce .
The example of cigarette packets shows that warnings like this could be useful .
The aim of this report is to provide an assessment to relocate the current campus canteen to a location that would be more accessible for all the students . Hence , it will hopefully prove both the profitability of the canteen and the important role it plays for all the students on the campus .
He was worried that the bird might charge him , so the man seeks refuge and goes in a cave .
Suddenly he understands that he has heard a noise so he decides to stay in the cave away from danger .
It 's the day after and Jonas has stayed all night in the cave and in the cold .
At dawn the man goes out of the cave and looks at the sky to see if there is a bird of prey .
Jonas does n't see the bird and thinks that the predator has gone away , during the night .
So he decides to go home .
He decided to take the penknife that he had in his bag , and he was successful in killing the bird of prey .
After two long days , Jonas gets home safe and sound and tells everything about his experience .
As all of us know , today 's generation prefers everything to be their own .
And in the process of owning , we have moved so far ahead that a day will come when we will strongly claim that public transport does not have any future .
As our country is developing , there will be a time when each and every individual will be self - reliant and will definitely prefer having their own vehicle to commuting from one place to the other .
In 1999 some college friends went to the desert on their holiday . They went camping to have fun .
But one day , two guys with quad bikes saw something wrong , and they sad " what 's that ? " . They saw a dead body . They were scared and ran to their camp .
The other friends called the police .
The police came with a big investigation .
the investigation accused them and investigate prison .
After two days , the police saw somebody at the crime scene . The policeman asked them what they were doing there . He was scared and puzzled .
They caught him and
after two days he confessed .
The policeman was sham feom the gues and he apologised .
television serves the dual purposes of entertaining and educating people . In order to cope with the competitive world and get recognized in the corporate world , one must strive hard , which in turn increases their stress levels .
Television has become one of the means to reduce stress levels . Besides providing entertainment , television has also become a source of information .
I have applied to your University and I am still waiting for an answer .
Also , I have not had an invitation to an interview yet .
The problem is that I am from Poland and I could be in Great Britain from 22 to 25 February .
I am sorry if I have not understood your previous e - mails .
Well , I 'm Sebastian Vega and I 'm studying engineering sustainable development .
One of the things that I feel stressed about are the final exams , because I have to study for all the classes and sometimes I am very confused by my notes .
To be honest , I take the finals exams as a challenge and it becomes exciting for me , and I think I learn a lot if I have pressure and most of the time , I get good grades .
Sometimes , I trust a lot and I have bad grades so I feel depressed .
Nowadays , public transport is hardly necessary to our life .
However , a lot of cities have a problem with traffic because of this . The problem is that citizens do n't use public transport , such as buses , taxis , or even the metro .
Consequently , gorvernment has started to support and take care of public transport .
Moreover , it 's not only a traffic problem , but the transport is also in bad condition .
A lot of toxic exhaust is emitted into the air .
How can we revive public transport ?
People are unpleasant because all of is is bad quality , so governments ought to update it with new technology which protects the environment .
Now , the price of a car is very low , so it is very easy to buy a car .
In the past , a family had only one car , but today we have a car for each of us .
The waiters are always smiling and they are very nice .
They wear black and white clothing like the decoration of the establishment .
And for spring and summer they open a beautiful large terrace .
This restaurant would be the best for our class .
At least they can meet other folks and relax , sunbathe and listen to the music .
In the summer around the lake there are so many concerts so you have difficulty finding the right one .
Luckily the schools are closed for ten weeks , so the young girls and boys have a lot of time to spend their
Nowadays , there is very little public transport . The general public prefer much faster and more convenient ways of traveling around . Though public transport is used in major cities to avoid traffic congestion , it is widely recognized that public transport is eco - friendly .
Public transport is used by many people around the world , including me .
Some public transport like trains do not pollute as much as cars or motorbikes .
Many people say that public transport is not comfortable . That 's true . From my point of view , a bus is not so uncomfortable .
Many people like travelling by car , but it pollutes a lot more than going by public transport . Public transport is cheaper than buying a car or motorbike , it also pollutes less than them .
Public transport is also used by children like me who want to go to school , high school or to university .
Finally , I think public transport has a very good future , because it has very good advantages but also some slight disadvantages . It 's also very useful for some people .
In my opinion , public transport should n't disappear .
I like to spend time with cute little kids and cooking is my favourite hobby .
In the evening , I would like to spend some time with those kids by organising some indoor and outdoor games for them .
I would feel more energetic throughout the day If I had some busy or tight - scheduled work . I came across your advertisement for this job and I really think that I would suit this job in every respect , because I have a friendly rapport with people around me . I would be pleased to receive your positive reply .
My town tries to take care of the environment , but sometimes it is not possible .
Some people do n't have any awareness of the need for a good environment .
Neither do they seem to take care of nature and everything around them .
For instance , my town has a lot of mountains with big forests , tall trees and many types of animals or plants .
However , that is n't protected by the government and its institutions .
Local Parliament haven't regulated principles or rules for the environment , so ecosystems have been destroyed , rivers are contaminated and pollution has increased in my town .
Besides , my town 's institutions have allowed some foreign enterprises or corporations to take our own resources without demanding that they be careful with the environment .
This is clearly a symptom of how my town does n't care about any element of the environment .
Nevertheless , in the last decade , some neighborhoods have become conscious of their context .
In this way , we can see that their population have so much control and they know that affects them .
Good management of the rubbish is a new trend in many neighborhoods of my town .
The recycling of plastic , paper , cardboard etc , by the population of the biggest neighborhoods in my town is a way to improve the environment .
My favourite sport is boxing , because it 's the only sport that can relax me .
In my opinion , this sport teaches us to be mature , because , in addition to setting up the person physically , it instructs the mind .
I began this sport 2 years ago .
My brother had won so many fights and when I saw him proud I wanted to try that .
I do n't know what I can tell .
Most people prefer large colleges to small colleges for their many advantages .
First , the majors they offer are numerous and diverse .
They have a lot of faculty members .
They give the students the freedom to choose their majors and their teachers .
In addition , they have a lot of facilities that serve students , like kindergartens that take care of the children of the employees , university housing , a hospital the students of medicine can be application in and it serves the people too , and a big library which has many books in various languages .
Besides that , they have some services like transport for students and faculty , some restaurants , and a mini - market .
In addition , the location of large a college is clear and in the center of the city , so that is it easily accessible .
In the end , large colleges admit larger numbers of students , so the students may establish more friendships with people of different nationalities . Also they serve the community by qualifying many students in various majors .
Once upon a time , there was a boy whose name was Michael .
He had very beautiful brown hair , green eyes , and a perfect smile .
Michael loved to play football all the time .
One day , he woke up early in the morning and he went out to play football before school . When he was playing , he saw something running very fast and go away .
He went back home to get ready for school and he tried to forget what he had seen , but he could n't .
After school , he did n't go home directly because he wanted to check if what he had seen in the morning was real or not , but he did n't find anything .
Next day , he woke up early again , not to play football but to see if that stranger would come back that morning , and he saw him again .
He rushed from his bed to the street and walked to his way to see what he did every morning . When he was walking after the strange man , he noticed that he stopped at every trash can in the street to take a look before going to the next one . And , guess what ? He saw Michael and ran away and Michael was afraid .
The stranger was looking for food in the street to take to his family .
We visited the Tower of London , Buckingham Palace and the wax museum .
I liked the wax museum the most .
There are statues of famous people from different walks of life made of wax . When were you last on a school trip ? Where was it and what did you see ?
The organisation has reached its current position because of people like you .
We would like to give you six months to scale up your skills .
We are looking forward to seeing your participation in the Organisation after six months .
Almost every weekend , I go to the playground to play basketball with my classmates .
Furthermore , I watch NBA matches on TV every day .
I am quite interested in how the stars are getting on .
This becomes the concern of employers , since it may impact on the students ' learning outcomes .
The plot of this film is about a 25-year - old naive woman who was living and studying in Taiwan and one night went out clubbing and met a crazy guy who involved her in a seedy drug smuggling racket with a Korean criminal gang that forced her to be a drugs mule .
A new substance , called CPH4 , destined to be distributed around Europe and the United States by which a full bag was put into her stomach by illegal clinical surgery .
But everything went out of control for the criminals when one of her captors kicked her in her abdomen . The substance spills through her body and she begins to experience a different state of consciousness in which she dizzily enhanced her IQ from 2% to almost 100% of its capacity .
During this time , she contacts Samuel Norma , PhD , the Professor of a university , to ask him what happens if a person reaches 100% of their mental activity or IQ .
It is a gripping film , starring Scarlett Johanson and Morgan Freeman in quite good acting , that will keep you tense until the last scene and does n't leave you feeling unpasible .
Nowadays , people are using their own cars instead of public transport . This is more obvious in big cities where the price of public transport is more than in smaller cities .
People are getting used to driving their own cars ; it provides more comfort , and is more practical .
You can use it whenever you want , and it 's not necessary to stand in long queues at metro or bus stations .
The government are opposed to investing in public infrastructure , because the benefits are lower every year .
They prefer to invest in public roads and motorways .
The impact of this has huge consequences for climate change . In the future , the global pollution will increase according to the level of cars .
Travelling by car is very bad .
By using public transport we protect the environment .
Pollution is a global problem .
If we travel by car , we generate more pollution than with public transport .
On the other hand , public transport pollutes less than the car but the car is very comfortable and not be hour hard .
With a car , I feel more free as I do n't depend on other people to get to the destination .
I believe that in the future all transport will be public transport or , at least , mass transport .
The current system is not sustainable .
Recently , I saw the trailer of a film about vampires .
The girl is 18 years old and the men ( as it later turns out ) are vampires and they are over 100 years old .
He falls in love with her .
Then there is the older brother of the boy ( vampire ) and he also falls in love with her .
I like this trailer and I think that the film would be cool .
He had to buy a present for his girlfriend 's birthday but it was Sunday and all the stores were closed , so he had to find a solution .
A few hours later , he was walking past a garden , and suddenly , he saw the most beautiful flowers that he had ever seen , so he picked them up .
However , flowers were n't enough , so he decided to think of something else .
If you do n't want to experience this situation , you must always do things on time .
I think public transport is better for the environment because going by public transport reduces the CO2 emissions and removes traffic from the streets .
Reducing the rush hours in the main hours causes a CO2 reduction in the air .
It is a true statement about cars . Travelling by car is so much more convenient and the new technologies apply to the
People should eat less fast food and do regular exercise to maintain a healthy lifestyle .
Many of us do not get enough time in the morning to prepare our lunch for the office .
Easy availability also tempts us to fast foods .
University education is good for students but they also need to learn industry - specific skills .
Students , for example learn many theories , which may not be required in their place of work .
In my opinion , what is expected is a new role for teachers and not their disappearance from classrooms .
At university level , the availability of IT training , software and manuals provides an ever accessible source of information that otherwise would not be to hand .
For example , India has a high rate of unemployment , hunger , poverty which leads to an immense embarrassment about being Indian .
Nowadays , the internet represents the whole of the knowledge that people have collected over the centuries .
So it provides a lot of interesting information , one example of which is about how different machines work , which can be found at www.howstuffworks.com .
Also , the ' internet ' nowadays helps to get information from all over the world , and if you wish to get involved , then go to www.bbc.co.uk . These sites are a free way to find the most relevant information about current events , both in society and technology .
One day I decided to buy a newspaper .
When I arrived at home , I started to read the newspaper , so I found out from there that The International Student Magazine have organized a short story competition , and I decided to call Michael to tell him about this contest .
Michael told me he knew about this contest and at that moment he wanted to call me to ask if I was able to come with him to that contest .
After I decided to go with him to the contest , I was thinking about going to that contest next year to participate in and win that contest , so this year I was wondering what the program was like .
When we arrived there , the emotions started to appear so definitely it was time to drink a hot coffee , before the contest started .
I was wondering if Michael passed that exam .
After Michael opened the door to the classroom , I saw in his eyes something strange .
When I opened the door , imagine my surprise at what I saw .
I could n't believe my eyes ...
When we came back to our dressing room , " Golem " was waiting for us .
" Golem " , as we all know , are magical creatures made from mud and having black rocks for eyes which can be brought to life by an incantation .
So , we were trying to save time until we managed to escape , but Niall did n't manage to escape , as they caught him when he stumbled and fell down .
Now , " Golem " are holding him hostage in their cave , which is hidden somewhere in Los Angeles . "
I looked at them , trying to think of something to do and then I said : " Come on boys , WE are going to SAVE Niall ! ! ! ! "
We took all we needed and started the search for Niall ... We went to all the caves in Los Angeles , but we could n't find them .
One night , while we were sleeping in our car , by mistake the car started to move and we woke up in a huge cave outside of Los Angeles .
I could n't believe my eyes , we had found Niall .
Then , we got out of our car and saved Niall , then we fought with " Golem " and came back home .
These days , an increasing number of people try to travel by car for convenience .
In my opinion , public transport will still exist in society .
Firstly , for long - distance journeys , the car is not as convenient as airplanes ,
for example . If you go to another city by car , you may spend more than two days on the journey .
In contrast , travelling by airplane just takes you two hours , and you can get to your destination .
The time spent on taking a plane is lower than taking a car .
Secondly , owning a car is not a normal thing for most developing or undeveloped countries .
The cost of buying a car and fuel is expensive for poor people .
Thus , it is important to use public transport , because it is much cheaper than a private car , and everyone can consume .
Thirdly , global warming is a serious problem for humans who live on the earth .
Air pollution is the main cause of global warming .
The great number of people using private cars leads to higher levels of air pollution , and public transport is one of the best solutions for decreasing air pollution .
To sum up , there are numerous benefits to using public transport , and it will not disappear .
Nowadays , public transportation is available almost all around the planet . We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave in the last century , but due to globalization and technological development , the transport sector is always in continuous transformation .
On the other hand we must mention how the plane sector has been growing . Currently it is the most common mode of transport for going away and that also means that shipping manufacture has decreased deeply , in order to let the plane market boom .
Talking about local transport , we have a lot of choices like cars , motorbikes , buses , trains , but also , as we were saying , planes .
According to the information donne , the most used mode of transport is the car as most families have one , but public transportation is getting more and more common for those who want to preserve the planet and develop other alternatives more respectful of the planet .
As we were saying , the new ecological movement is increasingly more powerful and charismatic . Due to that , bikes are also increasing their role in the new age . They are also linked to the new fashion of being a hipster .
In conclusion , we are seeing a new tend in transport . Increasingly , they are faster and more developed , with the latest technology included , but in contrast , we find also a contradiction , as we found another trend for traditional transport which avoids pollution in order to respect the Earth .
I agree that commuting by car is easier and faster than most public transportation . However , there are serious problems that come from it . The number of vehicles on the roads keeps increasing and causes congestion and pollution , which are far more severe than the inconvenience caused by public transportation .
Thus , I think the future of public transportation will be more prosperous .
Many thanks for your message .
When you can , call me .
Then , if you want , we could go to the restaurant in the city .
Later , if you want , we could find a job for three months . In my opinion , a good job for three months could be as a waiter , because waiters get a lot of money in the three months of the summer .
Also , I believe that lifeguard could be a good job , because , in summer , the people go to the beach and they need lifeguards .
If I were you , I would choose to be a lifeguard , because lifeguards earn more money than waiters .
If you want , we could go to the capital city of my country . We will go by car because a car is cheaper than the bus or train . We could eat in the famous restaurants of the city or we could go to the cinema . Also , if you want , we could visit the medieval wall .
I am looking forward to seeing you .
Best wishes

Mobile phones are the most important thing in our daily lives . They are the most effective method for instantaneous communication .
However , the extensive use of mobiles creates lot of problems .
This essay evaluates whether the demerits outweigh the merits .
To begin with , nowadays people are addicted to mobiles . For example , young people waste their valuable time on mobiles .
Moreover , their concentration is reduced .
Another serious problem is people are creating relationships with unknown people , and this can lead to several issues including crimes .
To sum up , let people be aware of the drawbacks of phones and use them wisely .
Public transport is generally the transport system provided by the government for the general populace .
This transport includes buses , trains & boats etc .
People of all classes can use these .
This facility helps the general populace to save money , because usually this transport is the least costly .
The first time I rode on the horse , I was 14 , and since that time , I enjoy it very much .
When I ride a horse , I feel much better and forget all of my problems .
Riding a horse gives me a sense of freedom .
If you want to start to ride a horse , the main thing that you should know is " do n't be afraid of horses ! "
I think it is an important illness because it affects the family of alcoholic people .
Moreover , alcoholics should go to the doctor in order to get well .
In conclusion , alcoholism is a serious problem for all of society .
I 'm a big fan of science fiction movies . Although this kind of movie is actually sometimes a little bad , in the last weeks a new one has been released , and I was totally surprised by this one .
Interstellar is a new Christopher Nolan movie which has the participation of some Hollywood stars , such as Matthew McConaughey , Anne Hathaway and Matt Damon .
Public transport has a big role in transportation especially in large cities like the capital city of countries . Using a car sometimes causes traffic jams if everyone uses their own car . To avoid this , a good road network is needed . Also , the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation .
On the other hand , public transportation takes more time to get to the required destination , because public transport takes a long route to get to more places and as more people take advantage of it , public transport is usually crowded and is not on time .
For that reason , using your own car is more convenient than public transport . You can travel whenever you like and wherever you want .
Finally , in the near future , most people will be using their own cars , because it saves a lot of time as compared with public transport and the time factor will be more important in the future .
On school days , I get up at 5 a.m. and go jogging in my neighbourhood for 15 minutes .
After school , I keep running on a track to be an athlete in a school sports team .
In the rainy season , it is boring to do practice as nobody is on the field .
I come back home at sunset .
However , I ca n't go to bed early because I have to do my homework for tomorrow 's school .
My favourite day is Saturday because I do not need to work or study , so I can go out with my friends , and on Sunday I can wake up very late .
Write soon ,
My favorite sport is basketball .
It is an amazing sport .
When I jump to throw the ball in the basket , I feel like I am flying .
When I run with the ball , I feel like I am holding a goal or a valuable object and I should offer my best to put it in its place and do it in the right way .
I know that I am not a professional player and I do n't belong to any team , but I like this game . Basketball is so simple play but it needs speed , concentration and the ability to determine distances . It consists of two teams of five players and each team tries to get a point by throwing the ball through the basket .
What I like most about this game is that the smallest number of players can play it , even two players . I recommend everyone to try it , especially with their friends or family .
In this episode of my life I will to talk to you about my daily routine .
I wake up early , like 7 am . At that moment , I go out to the backyard to turn on the boiler , then I go to kitchen .
Nowadays , people live in a very modern and fast society and try to have as convenient a life as it is possible .
One of the many possibilities for making our lives more convenient is to use cars rather than public transport .
Firstly , I would like to mention public transport types .
The most common are bus and train , but in the cities , people can use trams , subways or boats , and for a long distance , they can take a flight .
From my point of view , the main disadvantages of public transport , which make our lives uncomfortable , are time and place limitations , sharing the space with others , lack of free seats .
On the other hand , people should think about the environment , pollution , global warming , which are all currently warning .
We should think of a better future and try to be environmentally friendly - try to avoid the huge amount of pollution which is caused by cars and not think only of our comfort .
On my birthday 's day , I directed go to school this morning . I wonder whether my birthday passed it at lunch time .
At that point , someone invited sing to me , after school , they and I went to dinner and went to sing .
At KTV , they touched me because there were a lot of people who had planned a birthday party for me .
After I finished I went home , because I was so tired that I fell asleep and fell down .
The next day , I was reluctant to get up and go to class .
Suddenly , I thought my gift was gone . The students said they did n't take it , but I doubted them , so we quarrelled .
I got home from school , only to find a gift on the sofa .
I offered an apology out of harm students , but fortunately they did n't get angry with me .
It is easy to make a boiled egg .
There are four steps to boiling an egg and some tips to make it delicious .
Here is the recipe : First , get some equipment , like a pan , water , one or more eggs , and , of course , a stove .
Second , put the hot water and eggs into the pan .
I think you should save money for the future , because you may have to buy something important with your own money .
In my opinion , there are more important things than computer games , so spending money on them is like wasting money .
In the future , you 'll have to pay a lot of money for university , a new home and so on , and I think you should start saving money . I should do it too , but it 's not easy , actually .
Actually , where I live , the public transport is highly used . It seems that in the near future it wo n't disappear .
In fact , in some overdeveloped countries maybe it will disappear , because I suppose travelling by car is much cheaper and faster .
But , that future is very far from our current situation .
Collecting books is my favourite pastime .
I started my hobby when I was a child .
The first item in my collection was an ABC book .
And now , I have a lot of books of all kinds : biology , chemistry , novels , dictionaries , etc .
Now I have about 100 and will have more in future , I hope .
Whenever I find an interesting book , I buy it immediately .
Sometimes , my family and my friends give me books as gifts .
This is the first text I would like to write on this website . I think it is a good idea to contribute to English language research and improve my skills at the same time .
As this is my first time , I would like to find out how exactly the system works , so I chose to write this random text rather than those serious topics available .
Public transport is more convenient than cars in many ways . When we use public transport that benefits in many ways .
Maintaining cars is expensive .
With public transport you do not need to worry about filling up with petrol , checking tyre pressures , getting tired after driving a long way .
In the future , cutting public transport will affect many people .
Elderly people are n't able to drive and always depend on public transport .
If public transport services stop , people who are not able to drive will be affected a lot .
Travelling by car is convenient but there are disadvantage as well .
As our population is growing fast , in a family both husband and wife are working and children at university are able to drive , so you are looking at at least 3 cars per household , so imagine how busy our roads will be .
As fuel prices are now coming down , that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever ; prices go up and down .
In summary , public transport is important for our community and people have to raise their concerns regarding this .
Stopping public transport is not going to gain anything , and the impact will be unpredictable .
I think sport is good exercise for people who need to exercise . I have a suggestion for people that want to have good health : choose an interesting sport and try to play it , let it be a regular thing , it will be fun and healthy for your physical constitution .
Michael had just realized that he had n't heard the alarm clock , so he got in a panic immediately : - I ca n't arrive late for work .
He jumped out of bed and had a quick shower . There was no time for breakfast so he decided to buy something to eat near the office .
After the shower , he got his suit , but he had forgotten that he had n't done the ironing the previous day . Moreover , he did n't have any other ironed suits , so he did it quickly .
In spite of that , he was dressed on time .
Although it was n't true . He had forgotten to unplug the iron .
Does basketball have the fame that it deserves ?
Nowadays , basketball is the sport which rules in the USA .
90% of Americans want to be a basketball star , with the dream of playing with Lebron James , Pau Gasol , Marc Gasol ...
According to the results of a questionnaire ( Houston inhabitants ) most of them play basketball to forget homework , problems and to relax in their free time .
Also , they think that the main reason for their preference instead of other sports which is more intense .
Furthermore , they give advice to all those novices at basketball " do n't ever lose the passion " , because if they give up , they wo n't play with the biggest players in the world .
In conclusion , the real objective of the questionnaire consists of what the people think about the king sport of the United States of America .
I 've been jogging for five years .
It is the way I can unwind , because my studies are stressful .
It gives me a sense of achievement . For these reasons , I would like to it do every day .
I love jogging because it 's a way to stay outdoors , immersed in nature .
I think there are no negative sides to jogging .
I have been really into skiing since I was a baby .
My mother made me start .
Since then , every year , I go to northern Italy to practice .
I fell relaxed being alone near mountains and snow .
Hello Oskar ,
There is a good restaurant in my town and I think you will like it .
It is called ' The Rose ' and it is in the city centre opposite the station .
You will see it when you get off the train .
The meals are English cuisine and with some European dishes too .
When I went there last , it was on my birthday and I went there with my family .
I like the people who serve there and the decoration is pretty .
They cook good meals .
You must try it !
If you go there , tell me what you think .
I am sure you will have a fun time .
Public transport has advantages and disadvantages . i will start with the disadvantages .
First , public transport is neither comfortable nor safe .
Public transport is very crowded , so you may not have a seat . I hate public transport because I was attacked by a madman once . also taxi is not a good mode of transport . I hope I have my own car soon to avoid public transport . Travelling in your car makes it easier and better .
The advantages might include that it has a low price and might rescue you if your car is not working .
I am writing with regard to your outsourcing service because I am currently having a problem with my accounted . For this reason , I am looking for a new service that can help me .
If you do have this service , maybe you are the people that I am looking for .
I would appreciate it if I could arrange an appointment with you to find out about your service .
I 'm a really sporty person . I love different sports . I think that it 's something that is great for your body and your metabolism , Did you know that doing exercise can reduce depression and increase the quality of your life ?
I think one of my favorite sports of all is athletics . I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself , you have to be better every day than you were yesterday . It forces you to improve every time . Also , it is an exercise that helps your whole body , especially the legs , because it gives them great strength , but also your hands , because they have to be in constant movement , and all the body in general , because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and helps you to have coordination .
I enjoy running a lot because it relaxes me . I let out all my worries and frustrations , so it makes me happy .
I recommend all people who want to run , if you do n't feel like you 're improving , keep going anyway and with time you will see results .
I am not sure that mine is the best family in the world , but I am pretty sure that I have the best parents I could ever have wished for .
I am the eldest of the children , then after me is my brother Sidi .
Sidi is 24 years old . And last is Joni , who is only 15 years old .
Generally , I miss them all because I live in a distant city away from where my family lives now .
I used to live with them for 25 years in Genoa , but last year I left home because I found a job in Milan , which is the city where I actually live now .
This is an introduction to how to make bank notes .
The first two step is to design them with background color artwork and security features and prepare metal plates using skilled machinists .
Then there are some requirements for printing sheets : color on both sides , special ink and images slightly raised .
The most essential and key process is manual inspection of printed sheets with three categories : good quality sheets , partially damaged sheets and bad sheets .
The acceptable and not damaged severely sheets are supposed to be packaged and distributed , which means they will be cut into separate bank notes , packed and then dispatched .
In contrast , other failed sheets will be destroyed and disposed of with band notes in a secure way .
Once upon a time , a boy was six years old .
He had a lot of animals : two dogs and three puppies , four horses , eight ducks and one cat , Lionel .
Lionel was a black and white cat , and he was a very funny , fast and sweet animal .
It was Michael 's favourite .
Lionel was Michael 's best friend .
When Lionel was around , Michael , the boy , was happy .
One day , Michael got up late , and he had to go to school at seven o'clock .
It was six o'clock and he had to hurry if he did not want to get to school late .
Michael was out all day , and Lionel did n't have anything to eat ....
When I was a little girl I used to play volleyball and I really liked that .
One day , I had a surprise . I met a teacher and he invited me to train in a huge gym in a team .
I started to think that I was born for that sport .
I worked so hard , but really enjoyed playing .
Suddenly something happened . I needed to work to play my studies in high school , so life changes anyway . I needed to stop my favourite sport , because I needed to study at that time . It was more important to me .
Today I do not play volleyball anymore , but I really enjoy dancing . Now I can say that it is my favourite , it is all of .
The line graph shows the U.S. cigarette price in dollars related to cigarette consumption in billions of packs from 1970 to 2006 .
The hugest gap is in 1981 , when the cheapest price was combined with the highest expenditure on cigarette packs in the whole interval .
In approximately 1998 we can notice an equilibrium price at $ 2.75 and an equilibrium quantity at 23 billion packs .
Later , both lines changed their regular trends so there is a huge imbalance again .
My English is great and speaking is my favourite part of learning English .
The world is progressing rapidly . Day by day there are new modes of transportation , there is new technology .
From the beginning of the world till now , mankind has wanted a fast income and an easy way of life , so he tries more and more to find a solution to his problems by creating new ways of living more easily and more conveniently for him .
So , transportation is one of the most important issues facing mankind , because it is related to interaction between people , like trade and many other purposes .
From this point every human has the ability to buy a car and also buy his rest , he will not hesitate to do it .
It is claimed that our lives will improve in the next fifty years .
But we do n't know if this change will be good or bad . I hope it will be good , but let 's talk about it .
Firstly , I 'd like to talk about jobs . I think that these are the most important thing to worry about . If our studies get better , we will create more jobs and as a result the economic situation of the country will be better .
Moreover , our capacity for learning more languages seems to be really adequate . Unfortunately , while there are a lot of teenagers that are working really hard , there are others that are all the opposite .
I think it is probable that in some years the technology could have improved quite a lot , and this is a very powerful advantage for us , the young people .
Because we were born in ' the internet generation ' as everyone says , so this aspect might be helpful for us .
In conclusion , I 've got to say that now we do n't have to worry about the future , we just have to carry on in the present and do the best we can .
Hi Alex ! How are you ? I heard that you are going out with Mike !
That 's fantastic news !
Anyway , I was wondering if you wanted to go to the cinema with me to see the new Leonardo Dicaprio s movie , because I heard that action movies are your favourite .
It is about a little girl who was adopted but she is 35 years old in reality .
Nowadays the public transport system is running out of passengers due to heavy use of personal transport such as cars and bikes . In the early 1990s , the public transport systems were the most popular transport system across the world because , most people did not have their own vehicles . But in the late 1990s , most people were able to buy their own vehicle thanks to many financial institutions which have various loan facilities .
Today , many people use their own vehicle instead of public transport . The other thing is , it is an easy and convenient way to travel to work and any other personal work . , therefore , it can be seen that the demand for public transport is getting lower and lower .
In conclusion , it is true that the demand from the public is going down rapidly as they have their own vehicles .
However , even though everybody has their own vehicles , they will have to use public transport because the roads are full of vehicles .
My favourite sport is football , and I enjoy it because I love football players .
I would advise you to the person starting the sport endeavor and can fulfill their dream . Many ca n't get what they accomplished . Those players are very famous today .
You can learn with your referee and with a coach .
Some people prefer playing together , but there are also competitions between players .
I think that this class discussion ca n't be true .
In the future , people 's live will be better .
Providing that we care about the environment .
If we live well , we will be more careful with the world .
Otherwise everybody wants a better future .
Nowadays , there are a lot of things that we do to make life easier .
If I were you , I would live well in the next 50 years .
I 'm looking forward to people having more interest in this case .
For instance , my family do n't think that will happen in the next 10 years .
They live in the moment .
Besides , they say all the time : ' Carpe diem ' .
This is another opinion .
My family consists of 5 members - my father , my mother and two brothers .
My father is a businessman .
He is 65 years old .
He works in real state investment .
My mother is a teacher .
She is 50 years old .
She works in a primary school .
My older brother is 30 years old and he is working as an accountant for a radio and television union in Cairo .
The younger brother is 25 years old .
He is a dentist .
He is doing a Master 's in Turkey at the moment .
The last member is me . I 'm an aeronautical engineer in Qatar .
I love my family , but everybody is staying or living in a different place or country .
The best brother for me is the second one , who is a dentist .
He is my best friend and brother .
I hope I can live with him in the same place .
He is very helpful and collaborator .
We had a fun time at the beginning of our lives , when we were kids .
They spent their lives helping us to be good men .
My older brother helped us with studying , but he is older than me by 10 years , so the relationship between us is n't close .
Anyway , I 'm very happy to write for you .
This assertion is totally false .
The expansion of public transport is one of the keys to saving the planet , especially if the energy source used comes from clean sources .
Nowadays , the use of vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel is the main cause of air pollution in big cities around the world . Research shows that private cars are used , most often carrying a small number of people at a time , which makes it very inefficient considering the quantity of carbon dioxide and other toxic substances emitted into the environment each time the engine is started .
A lady decided to visit her boyfriend .
But her boyfriend lived upstate and did n't have an airport he 's of city Because of that , she needed to travel by train .
She just packed a suitcase . After that , she went to the train station .
I think that the increase in teenage crime is because their parents do not set limits on them , and do not pay attention , so they make all kinds of serious mistakes .
Another good option is to give them a difficult job to keep them busy every day . But I do n't know what kind of job it could be , because a person who commits a crime is n't going to do something to help society , like community service .
I was sitting calmly in a cafe , when I heard it ringing .
At first , I thought
But I saw an unknown phone number on the display and felt a little bit nervous .
What if it was my boss or clients and possibly something dreadful had happened at my work ?
It went on ringing and , with great fear , I clicked on the green button .
Luckily , it was my colleague Jane , who wanted to drink a cup of fresh coffee with me .
The flowchart provides an overview of the steps for making bank notes . It shows how bank notes are manufactured from design to a thing we can use .
First , should take some considerations in design , including background colour , artwork , security issues .
Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes ( 50 bank notes per sheet ) . Subsequently , the technical must be used specially for distinction , for example , the colour printed on both sides , special ink is used and images are slightly raised .
Depending on the quality of sheets , there will be two results . If the quality is good or the bank note is partially damaged but can be used , it will be cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and dispatched , while any bad sheets will be securely destroyed .
My height is about 5.2 , my hair color is dark brown , my eye colour is black and I will be wearing jeans and a long shirt . I will be arriving at 20 past 3 .
There are no very big supermarkets near my home , but there is a nice one .
It is situated on the main road opposite my home .
The space is about 100 m^2 and it has automatic doors for entry and exit .
Near to the entry , someone welcomes customers and answers their questions .
There are some big shelves in the center of the supermarket that are divided into different parts for different kinds of goods , like dried fruit , nuts , flour , condiments , beans , grains , rice , etc .
Also , a section for detergents , tissues , perfumes , etc .
You can see some store fridges around the supermarket for drinks and dairy products like milk , yogurt , cheese , butter and cream . Also , chest freezers for ice creams . In one corner , they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find what they need .
There is a cashier next to the exit and you can pay by credit card or cash .
When you talk with someone , do you ever think about your words before you say them ?
A lot of us never think before we speak and that is not good .
You must think a little bit before you speak as one word can cause a lot of pain for others for the rest of their lives . you may not actually notice that , but you will feel what I really mean if someone says to you painful words .
It is clear that everyone is prone to making a mistake without even noticing .
For example , a kid named Michael .
Michael is a good boy and he always listens to his mother . on time , Michael was very angry because he got a bad score in his test . when he got home , his mother was cooking and she asked him what was wrong .
He said bad words that he would regret saying . he went to his room . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
In your last email you told me about your lack of time for enjoying your hobbies .
However , if I were you , I would do what I have always wanted .
And I know which subject you 've always been interested in : music .
I remember when you told me once you were playing a violin for four hours .
Anyway , you could always do some sport in your extra - free time .
I do n't like public transport .
I prefer travelling in a car or by motorbike . I feel safe .
In my family , we travel in a taxi , because a taxi is fast and secure .
Today I felt bad in public transport .
It was slow .
Also , I can see the air pollution is tallest .
Comparing cars and buses , the car is more expensive than the bus , because the car is comfortable and faster .
The taxi is too .
In the morning , I go to school by bus with my brothers , but they get up earliest .
I prefer travelling in the car .
Once upon a time , there was a little man called Michael . That man had the heart of a little child and the courage of a big man .
He had a girlfriend called Sinha , who was a girl with a big heart but , unfortunately , a broken one .
One day , Michael decided to throw a surprise party for Sinha to make her happy and make her feel his love more , so he arranged everything and , to keep it a surprise for her , he was busy all the time and did not show off all week as usual . That made Sinha worried and she suspected that Michael did not love her any more and had met another girl , and she became extremely sad , and it got even worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to give her the surprise but he did not answer his phone after that .
When he came she started crying and thought he would break up with her and she did not give him a chance to talk or explain anything . She started to cry louder and accused him of cheating . That made Michael astonished at how she did not trust in him , how she thought that about him , and he told her that he could not stand that anymore , he would break up with her , and he left . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
There 's no question which is my favourite restaurant in town : The Seaside . I will tell you why and also why it 's so appropriate for us , as a class , to have our last farewell dinner there .
Our class has changed over the years , with great classmates leaving and coming . We have always been welcoming , and not least towards the new ones .
It 's not necessary to be nice and kind to everyone , but our class actually is . At the weekends , the whole class gather together at different events .
What I just said is what the restaurant , Seaside , means to me . Welcoming .
At the Seaside , you are genuinely welcomed at the first doorstep , they accept you whoever you are .
This makes the
It all started at the Parson Institute in the art history class . Students of the race of Fine Arts . In the class the teacher in charge , Jimena , assigned a task to his students , saying :
-To begin this course , I want to be sure you know the meaning of art , so I want it translated into a sculpture or painting made by yourselves , without any specific technique , only your imagination , and with this you will explain to me what art is .
His excited students began going to their homes with this work , since they had only 4 days to fulfil their task .
After 4 days , they all came with spectacular pictures , portraits of people , large sculptures , apart from one student . Her name was Sandra . She arrived with a piece of crumpled paper , on which she had only written a name in a different style of letter , only there reflected , exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work , but the teacher said :
Art is complex , and seeing that everyone laughed at the work of his classmate , I can see that nobody understood the real meaning , since art is different for each person , each creates a different definition , so we must respect each person and understand that each person is a different world and everyone is art .
A student that really moved him , and reflect so apologetic , and went out of the room , closing the door , and Michael knew then that he had made a mistake .
My favorite sport affects me greatly . I 'm a kung - fu fighter .
This sport is my favorite , but sometimes I think about leaving this sport , because lately , I hate blood , so I think a lot about leaving this sport , but it is dominated to me .
It makes me like an animal when i 'm standing and getting ready to fight . I 'm converted into the enemy . I 'm a fucking ghost and I can kill anyone who tries to stop me .
So , I 'm really thinking about leaving this sport .
Everyday I get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends . I exercise more and more to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world . I 'm a champion of my sport , so , I seek to put all my efforts into being the best in the world . Finally I did not have the encouragement of my family or my teachers .
Hello to everybody ! !
Now I 'm going to talk about the benefits of learning another language .
I am from Spain , so my native language is Spanish .
I started to study another language when I was a child . I started learning English , because everyone said that English was the language of the future . When I finished school , I tried to study French but it was too difficult for me .
I have to say that studying another language gives you more opportunities , because these days you need to know other languages to find a job and be more intelligent than your colleagues to get the work and that 's great .
And today it is necessary , because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversations with them , you need to know more than your native language , because in the rest of the world , and particularly in Europe , people know more than two languages and that 's great .
I think learning another language never has drawbacks , because all you learn is good for you and your brain . You never stop learning new things .
These days , most people feel comfortable travelling by car and so they believe that public transport is not going to continue for long .
However , I do not agree with them , because in most parts of the world mass transport systems are still popular and they are environmentally friendly and cost - efficient .
Firstly , public bus services are very popular in most parts of the world .
In most parts of Europe , people still prefer public buses instead of cars for travelling .
Secondly , public transport is environmentally sound in comparison to private vehicles .
It carries more people , while a private vehicle carries fewer people .
Public buses prevent more cars from polluting the environment .
Finally , public transport is cost - efficient .
People need to spend more money on fuel if they want to travel to the same destination by private vehicle .
In conclusion , although the car is convenient for travelling , it is not enough to being an end to public transportation .
In the towns of the future , care for the environment will be one of the most important things .
People have conciencied themselves that they need to respect nature and the places where we live .
Human beings have destroyed our environment over time , and now the earth is in danger .
The first place we need to care about is our near place , the town .
I like to take out the trash every night and I try to recycle my trash , throwing it away in different bags .
I have recently bought an electric car as a substitute for my traditional car .
An electric car is less harmful to the environment .
When I go out to the countryside , if I lunch there , I take care to clean the ground .
I like neither dirty people nor dirty places .
In the future , I hope to live in a clean town and I 'm sure that most people are now thinking this way . We need to take care of our town because nobody likes to live in a dump .
Military service is military training which means people have to join the army or voluntary service for a period of time .
In Korea , people have to do military service for at least 2 years .
Similarly , people have to do it for 1 year in Taiwan .
There is debate about whether everyone should have to do military service when they reach 18 years old .
With supporters maintaining that it is important for national security and makes people mature , whilst opponents claim that military service has effects on people 's studies and people should have freedom of choice .
Firstly , every country requires stability and must be protected by strong armed forces for national security .
If a war or other danger threatens the safety of a country they can not get help from other countries immediately .
Therefore , people accept that military service could be an easier way to protect their country .
In particular , some countries with small populations have a policy that people need to do military service to develop into a powerful country .
Secondly , it is important for people to become mature when they complete military service , which probably is a particular experience at 18 years old .
In addition to having hard physical training and getting different special skills , people also can improve their personal qualities through military service .
Consequently , people could be more independent and strong . They seem to become mature earlier than other people who do not do military service .
In contrast , opponents of military service point out that education is the first vital thing for people who reach 18 years old .
Military service mainly improves physical fitness , but education might be completed better in school at that age because it has a professional teacher team and a good study atmosphere , people usually find it easier to concentrate on learning knowledge .
For instance , some countries allow people to do military service after all their courses have finished .
Additionally , critics argue that countries are able to allow people to have freedom of choice about military service .
Some people are unwilling to do military service , while some people volunteer for military service and possibly enjoy it .
Furthermore , it also can respect rights of people , especially women who are not able to adapt to the hard training .
In conclusion , it can be concluded that military service is necessary for national security and good for people to improve themselves .
The best course of action would be for government to attempt to allow people to volunteer for it when they have completed their studies .
Dear
Lou
This is Danbi from ueecx13 .
By your favor , I can study at UNSW from next year .
I really appreciate your encouraging us every time in class .
Best wishes for a wonderful holiday season and a very happy new year .
This city does n't have a lot of citizens but it 's a tourist city .
So in the streets we always have a lot of trash cans .
In our city , we have a billboard to urge people to pay attention to the environment .
In the schools , we set up a workshop to tell students how important the environment is to our lives .
The citizens of the city want to build the city with the slogan " The city is green - clean - beautiful " .
So they are aware of the need to help the city achieve that .
So everyone brings the trash to the place permission .
Every year we have " earth hour " .
In this hour , many people turn off the lights in their house to save energy and protect the environment .
I am very proud of the awareness of my city 's people .
I wish a lot of people around the world could see the importance of the environment .
And they have to act to protect it .
I was in a museum in New York looking at all the beautiful paintings and sculptures , when I heared the museum alarm . Everyone was afraid , including me .
The police were chasing a thief that stole a painting , but he escaped instantly .
I went to my apartment and turned on my TV and I saw on the news that the bandit had escaped with 3 paintings .
I went to the museum and followed all the clues and I found a broken sculpture .
I search for any clues and I found something . It was a piece of paper with an address on it .
I went to the address and when I got there it appeared to be an abandoned house .
I decided to wait and hide in the bushes if I saw someone entering .
In the night , I saw a shadow entering the house .
I carefully approached the window of the house and I saw two men with the paintings .
They left the house in a truck .
I followed them in a taxi .
We were at the terminal of New York . It was a very famous landmark .
I located them instantly because I recognized their hats .
They threatened all the people cruelly , so all the sightseers were angry with them .
However , the layout of the terminal was unknown to me , so I was completely lost .
We got on a train . The ceiling was comfortable but everyone was complaining about the two men .
When we arrived , we were on the other side of the city of New York . The features were so common because it was a good economic and conveniently because it would attract more tourists .
I finally trapped them . Their names were Lucius Fowley and Bob Parker . I told the police and the police put them in jail .
And the paintings are in the museum again .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Today is a very important day for his future .
The watch showed the time was 9.30am and there were 2 hours left before he must go to the place that made his heartbeat so fast .
He had an interview to get a scholarship so that he could pursue his dream of studying medicine in Ireland .
He went to the bus station to catch the bus .
He took a few minutes walking to the bus station from his house .
After the bus arrived , he got on and half an hour later he arrived at the destination .
When he took a few steps from the bus he saw the very tall building where the interview place was located .
After waiting for an hour , the time came and , bravely , with a high confidence level , he walked into the office .
Suddenly , his water floaded and tears dropped from his eyes .
The interviewer who was sitting in front of him was a person with blue eyes that he really loved .
Peter , without hesitating , hugged the interviewer , who was a man about 40 years old .
The man , who was crying together with him , was his father who had left Peter and his mom because they had divorced 6 years ago .
Then the interview became a meeting between a father and a son that was really touching .
Kill two birds with one stone is a perfect idiom to describe Peter 's situation , because he got his beloved father back and can still pursue his dream of studying in Ireland .
Hello ,

Hello ! I am beginning to study technical English .
I want to do this course , because it will help me to enlarge my vocabulary .
Would you like to do this course with me ?
Please , write me a list with the words that I need for technical conversation .
I am writing to give my opinion of the restaurant " The Crazy Cat " . It is a very good restaurant .
First , the restaurant has a wide variety of food .
The chef can make the menu of the day for dinner or you can choose from a special menu .
The purpose of the chef is soup and creamed corn to start , beef medallion covered bittersweet of carrot sauce with nuts and the dessert is chocolate cake with cheese .
The atmosphere is also very good . It has live music with different bands .
you can choose from two rock or pop bands and one DJ .
The cost is reasonable .
The pack has a cost of $ 350 per person .
Can a TV programme entertain and educate at the same time ?
People complain about how the information in different TV shows does n't contribute to the process of learning . That 's why many of these programmes are considered trash , because of the multiple shows such as reality shows , talk shows , or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people .
A good example of these shows are how people are paid to act in reality or talk show where they show exaggerated or hilarious family problems , where the only aim is to get a bigger audience .
Another good example are the endless showbiz that have appeared recently . This type of program is one where the information is often gossip about the personal lives of famous singers and actors without taking into account whether they are true or not .
It 's a pity to know that only a few programs exist that try to educate people with the most up - to - date information through documentaries , investigations , cultural or opinion programs , which in my opinion help us to acquire more knowledge .
Knowledge that sometimes is unknown even though it is part of the general culture or proper of the history of our country .
I think in the future public transport wo n't exist because we will drive our own car .
When you drive your own transport , a car for example , you go to and from a specific place , but on a bus , you go to the bus stop and not to your house or school , work ...
It is better for the people to be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person . I know some people , drivers , began haven't got work , but the public transport is free and is free because it is the government who pay . This money bacame do to make more work for others .
Not everything is good . Some people haven't got money and ca n't go to another place and the pollution is increasing . It is a serious problem and the solution is only for rich people . The solution is buying an electric car . The other solution , more economical , is for the government to give money to the people to buy an electric car .
I do n't know what is better ; no public transport , or public transport .
There is no future for public transport , since everybody prefers to use their own car .
Time is valuable for everybody and nobody is bothered about money .
The traffic is very heavy nowadays , so it will be difficult to reach your office on time .
Public transport is always crowded , so it is not comfortable to travel on .
Find your joy in " Scary Movie "
I used to ignore thrillers due to my fragile heart , but my mind is changed now after watching this film .
The film is entitled " Scary Movie " and was directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans .
This story is about a murderer who completes his mission : killed everyone that he hated .
In the end , only one person could be alive , even though those sacrificed tried to escape this horrible result .
This is a story of horror and comedy combined .
I can not find a word to describe this film easily . What can I say is you will regret it if you miss this film .
The first reason is that all the actors show their talent in this film directly and the audience can follow their steps and the story certainly . This essential element also gives great success to the film .
Besides , the attractive storyline has a lot of climax , so that everyone can watch this film from the beginning to the end and this creates the billion box office to this film .
However , I think the props should be improved , such as the killer 's knife and the actors ' costumes . The knife looks as brittle as a handicraft , and I believe those are second - hand clothes . I think this is a pity in this movie .
Finally , your bravery can be increased after watching this film .
Hi everyone , my name is Jaime and I have a wife and a little child .
My wife 's name is Maritza . She is 30 years old . She is a beautiful and joyful woman . My son 's name is Rafi . He is 3 years old . He is a very handsome and fun child .
My wife likes to go out when she is free . She likes to visit touristic places .
My son likes playing sports . He is very little but he plays football . He is a very active child .
I 'm studying medicine . This major is very challenging although stressful , because the self - study is every day and there is a lot of information .
This major involves everything . We always have to consider all the possibilities to complete homework , you have to know the maximum possible information to be able to complete it .
When you get the answer or solution , you can see that all the effort was worthwhile .
Our teachers are doctors and they are in charge of teaching us about teamwork , so it 's common that one / two people do all the work ... with this I want to say , it is rewarding when our teacher asks something and we know the answer because we were able to study the whole topic .
I have experience of going to the hospital and it was very interesting .
I dealt with medicine students who are superior to me , for example , doctors and surgeons .
I could only oversee what they do to obtain visual experience and know what surgery was like .
How to learn English
It 's proven that to learn a foreign language , you have to go abroad .
You can study hard for years , but if you are n't obligated to use English for everyday things , you wo n't become good at it .
Of course , studying in a foreign country also has disadvantages .
Even though there are lots of different possibilities and scholarships , not everybody can afford them .
Living abroad , even for a short time , could be very stressful and people can feel homesick .
Despite that , there are more reasons to study abroad .
In addition , visiting new countries and meeting new cultures , helps to open your mind and to foster a lot .
I have done several school trips in the past few years and I 'm going to do it again for sure .
I am 14 years old .
I like travelling with my family and friends . I like travelling because I can get to know new people , places and cultures .
I do n't have a favourite subject , but l like English because we can communicate all over the world .
I love my cousin 's house , so I always visit him .
He is in 5¬∫. He goes to Clara Jackson High school .
He lives in Prado so I have to take two buses and that is very tiring .
The names of my best friends are Agustina , Emilia and Micaela . We are strange friends . We are in 6¬∫ together and that 's when we became friends .
I live in La Paz , in a house with my mother and my father .
I have two pets ; a dog and a bird .
I play online with people from all over the world .
I prefer playing football to playing basketball .
I play basketball at school .
I was born in 1996 on the 31st of January .
Carbohydrates are essential for a healthy diet .
They provide energy for our bodies .
Nutritionists recommend a quarter of a person 's diet should contain carbohydrates .
When your body takes in an insufficient amount of carbohydrates , the protein replaces the lack of carbohydrates to supply the body with energy .
And this will cause diseases in the long run .
Nowadays , I am studying for a degree in economics at the University of Barcelona .
I am applying for the vacancy in the summer camp .
Last year I was working every Friday and Sunday at a ski camp in la Masella .
Also , last summer I went to the United States and I was working in a summer camp .
Now our company is going to do multidimensional operations , not just focus on furniture , but also on home appliances .
In addition , we will adjust the company 's management structure in each department depending on the market 's reaction and the environment .
We have sold our products to the KA system for a few years . However , the products that we sold were usually popular consumer goods . It means cheat and we have no entry obstacles for other suppliers .
In addition , it is hard to collect money from the KA system .
And because we have our own factories and professional machines , we can easily avoid price competition .
We will research the market demand based on our core products , and produce high - quality products .
For the factories , because the Chinese demographic dividends are not like before anymore , low price and undiversified products should become verity and premium goods .
Therefore , we are reforming and making high - tech items , likes LEDs , photoelectric , vacuums , steam mops , etc .
Use this core technology to develop blow machine , air purifiers , irons , etc .
Also , for our wire racks , plastic
Nowadays , people have a lot of fear of pollution of the planet .
All governments are increasing their policies and laws relating to this topic and they also promote new rules in the daily life of the population .
One of the new rules for the reduction of pollution in the cities is public transport .
According to the general world laws about global warming , each country has considered its owns arguments about it .
I can give as an example how big cities around the world can reduce pollution more .
London is a good example , and Barcelona , too .
These cities do n't allow people to drive in the city centre , and the industry reduces its taxes if it 's increasing the politic nature .
The town mayor has given the population a free bus .
It 's a good idea to remove traffic jams .
I think , in conclusion , all people should have good behaviour and an open mind and they and myself also should take public transport more often .
We have different cultures here , and two main languages ; Arabic and Amazigh .
Morocco is a kingdom , like Spain and England . We have a king and princes .
On Monday , me and my friend Chrissy went to Big Ben .
we went to the Trocadero .
But the best was the Guards of Bukingham Palace .
Chrissy made a funny face but the guards did n't say anything .
The temperature was over 20 degrees .
We travelled to London by plane , but to come back we travelled by car and boat .
After we came back , I told my family everything .
Environmental changes are really needed in the current situation .
People contribution is very important in this matter .
The report explains how my town 's people take care of their surroundings to preserve this planet in a better way .
Firstly , hybrid cars are only allowed to be used during weekends . As a result of this , most people do not use their cars all week .
This attitude has reduced the enormous amount of smoke pollution from exhaust pipes .
Government policy changes help a lot with water preservation .
Many factories are following the regulations and not draining the harmful waste into the water .
Secondly , closed trash bins are provided for the people in order to collect the waste and recycling .
People come forward and utilise these bins effectively instead of throwing rubbish away .
As a result of this , the town looks clean compared to previous decades .
In addition to that , recyclable waste is sold and the money is given to the relevant person .
This gives motivation to the public and they can earn by using the right way to dispose of their waste .
Thirdly , public toilets have been opened for the public to eliminate the habit of urinating in public places .
Town council not only encourage people to plant trees or gardens , it subsidises their green improvements .
Example , free fertilizers , water pumps , and pesticides .
In summary , people take many initiatives and are moving forward to have a safe and attractive environment and surroundings .
This is an international sport because in all parts of world there are people that they play it .
Football is a famous sport . You can watch it on TV or you can see it live . There are a lot of level categories , the most famous category is the first .
People that play in this category are famous although you can see them on TV . If you want to be a big football player , you must practise more time and your life should be healthy .
You must care about your food and your habits so that you have a healthy body .
This sport is the best in the world and the most famous and I think that it is the most enjoyed .
Soccer is the best sport for me because you can get fit , meet other people and participate in competitions .
If you want to start doing this sport , you should be prepared to work hard .
This is a story about a country where there were no cats .
She gave the king an adorable kitten which she had brought with her .
How are you ? I am fine .
I am very sad to hear you say that you are going to leave our school soon . I really do n't want you to leave this school !
Because you are the best teacher in the whole world ! Many of our classmates really like you too ! We know that you are going to teach at Discovery - bay primary school . My English results are better since you taught me . I really love you , Ms Cumings ! Your friend Ms Decock told me that she is going to Australia , and I love you both . I hope you that you will come back sometimes !
The graph given shows the seasonal sales of ice - cream from two places at an English seaside resort from 2012 to 2014 . They are , respectively , an ice - cream van and an indoor public swimming pool .
As the graph indicates , the sales at the ice - cream van were generally higher than those at the indoor swimming pool .
In the case of the ice - cream van , it sold most in Jul - Sep each year , nearly reaching 5000 dollars and it was still slightly increasing year by year .
Every year , from January to July , the sales slightly increased and reached the peak in the third season , then they gradually slid back to the year 's bottom .
In the case of the indoor swimming pool , its sales did n't have large changes , it usually sold about 2000 - 3000 dollars ' worth in each season .
It usually sold most in Apr - Jun and Oct - Dec and slid to the bottom in Jul - Sep .
In general , its sales were falling as time went by .
It was a nice spring morning .
She put her cup of coffee on the windowsill , hooked up the brist on her beautiful little breasts , put right her colourful light - minded skirt , took her orange scarf and little red handbag and went to the door .
When she looked at him from under her long eyelashes , he turned away and stared at the landscape outside .
When she left , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Nowadays , we constantly use means of transport to go everywhere so that our lifestyle .
We are used to travelling by car , and , in fact , every family has one .
Despite this , travelling by public transport can be a better option in so many cases .
Certainly , cities will be crowded in the future because the population is always increasing .
Using your own car to go to the city centre could be a nightmare . It would be a stressful waste of time .
Unbearable traffic jams and no parking areas would be the main problems .
Besides , the price of petrol is increasing too , and it is likely it will be so expensive that most people will not be able to afford a car .
In contrast , there will be cheaper alternatives like buses , trains or even planes for long distances .
On the other hand , many drivers enjoy travelling in their own vehicle because they like to drive and they feel free .
Finally , governments and society are concerned about the environment and I think that they will decrease levels of pollution and co2 emissions .
In my opinion , public transport will not disappear , even if cars are much more comfortable , faster and more evolved than now .
No one can deny that time is a big factor in our lives .
Life is divided up in terms of time . We live through time , we grow with time
till Now , we talk in time and , finally , we perish after time .
The world is changed by time .
Time never stops and does n't wait for anyone .
We must value time . I hope my country is like a developed country in making the best use of time .
Once a moment is lost , it is lost for ever .
It can never be regained . Even the most powerful monarchs have been helpless to prevent time .
So we should be aware of the importance of time . I hope not to waste it and to make the best use of it to giving opportunity for rising . Those who waste it , will be left behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life .
The great men and successful guys became famous and rose through the suitable use of time . They a are guide and a source of inspiration for a new generation .
So , we can say that time is a double - edged sword , either helping you or against you , and the popular saying is right : " do n't put off the work of this day to the next day " because our work will accumulate . Then it will become harder to finish it . To ensure the best use of time in our lives , we need to be punctual . Punctuality avoids tension and trouble . Finally , even scientists have another vision of time . They have discovered that time is the fourth dimension through relativity theory , which exchange all concepts in science .
I ca n't say I hope that time will be more important in our lives and we need to save it .
Its name is Santa Marta and it is near Trujillo .
In my town , we have a big swimming pool , five parks , four bares and one state school .
In my town , there are a lot of old people , and there are not many children , because they live in other cities .
I love my town because , when I was a small girl , I went there , and I was with my grandparents , my cousins and my friends .
My best friend lives in Madrid , but we always used to be together in her house or in my grandparents ' house .
I have been very happy , and today I am happy here .
I miss you so much . How is your baby ?
I could come to Madrid .
You and I could see each other .
Next month , I am going to come to our town .
Will you be able to go ?
It will be fantastic !
I hope to see you soon .
Our friends always ask after you and your family .
Oh ! My brother , David , is going to get married ! Surprise !
I hope that you will be able to come to the wedding .
My boyfriend and I have a present for your little baby , Nick .
I love you so much , my dear friend .
The diagrams below show how bank notes are made through four steps and how bad sheets and notes are disposed of .
To begin with , the format of the bank notes needs to be designed . Factors for consideration include the background colour , the artwork and the security issues .
Secondly , equipment such as skilled machinists and metal plates have to be prepared for the next steps .
Thirdly , they print the sheets of bank notes ( 50 banks notes per sheet ) with special ink , where colour is considered on both sides and images will be slightly raised on the bank notes .
Most importantly , they manually inspect each printed sheet in case there should be damaged sheets .
Once damaged sheets are discovered , they individually separate them into good and bad ones and then burn the bad notes , making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality .
Good sheets are cut into separate bank notes , then packed and dispatched to other places , while the bad ones have to be destroyed securely .
The movie which I have chosen to write about is Microphone .
It is an Egyptian movie starring Khalen Aboelnaga and some young actors . The action of this film takes place in Alexandria , a city in Egypt , and it is about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they do n't have much money to produce their own albums ,
that sort of band is famous among young people and they call it " underground bands " . Their songs give a big concenet to the political and social situation in Egypt and they became famous after the 25 January Revolution . I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society . There is no chance for young people and if they find it , they face a lot of problems to save it and they do n't find time for other activities , and sometimes they work on something which they never learn from or love .
I live in a small town , and there are a few things that my town does for the environment : like recycling , for which we must know what material the things we throw away are made of , and put them in the right dumpster .
This is a small act for us , but if we all contribute , it will be a big help for the environment .
We can also use appliances that do not consume so much , if we can adopt sustainable electrical systems or buy organic products .
In the big cities , they have begun to build green buildings , they use electric public transport in order not to pollute .
In my opinion , there may be many rules , but if we do n't respect them , we will not help our habitat .
The most exciting day of my life was May 9th last year , when I attended secondary school .
I went to France with my friends and my teachers .
I caught the bus and I waved to my mum .
After six hours , we had lunch in a fast food restaurant in France .
Next , we visited a famous aquarium where I saw a lot of fish .
In the evening we had dinner in a particular restaurant and my friends and I took many photos of a famous sight .
I admired the sea while my friends looked around the shops .
The day after , we went to a perfumery and I bought a present for my mum .
My teacher wanted us to speak French .
In the end , my friends and I jumped into the sea .
On a nice day , my older brother surprised me .
It was the first time for me to play with a cat .
It was a nice experience .
I called it LOZAH because its color was like an almond .
An almond is called LOZ in Arabic .
It likes my laptop and it plays with the cursor .
That is funny , but makes me nervous .
It sleeps eighteen hours per day .
The nice sleeping of it is when it watches anime .
When the children go out , it becomes sad .
It chases ants and flies .
It hates water .
When we need to punish it we spread some drops of water on its face .
I hope it will be a good cat and a good experience for me .
my first job was as a babysitter .
I had to look after two little boys aged seven and nine years old .
I was seventeen years old when I decided to accept this job .
I was the babysitter of those children for all that summer and I enjoyed myself so much with them .
They lived in a big house with a lovely swimming pool where we could swim and play .
At the end of the summer , I kept on seeing those boys to help them during the school year .
This experience helped me a lot because I became much more responsible , not only with those boys , but also with my brothers and sister ( I have two brothers and one sister ) and I learned the meaning of working and earning money .
I did n't have problems because the children were quiet and respectful , and also because I had known them since they were born .
I hope to have answered all your questions .
I grew up in a one - parent family .
However , we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried her best to support my older brother , my older sister and me in completing our college studies . Of course , my uncle , younger brother of my mother lent a big hand to go through the hard times , so that made us often help each other in my family when a member was in difficulty .
In particular , I was the youngest member of the family , and I caused much more trouble when I was young .
I truanted and did not pay attention to my studies .
That was really the biggest harm to a hard - working woman like my mother who tried her best to feed me and help me complete my studies .
All the members of my family never gave up on me , and I finished my college studies , too . I have a good job now .
I do really thank my mother and all the members of my family for being patient and exertion to me . Now we have a great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness we have got not so easily .
First of all , let me introduce my town . I live in Kabul , the capital of Afghanistan .
This town is located in the central zone of Afghanistan with 4462(km¬≤ ) surface area , and has more than seven million inhabitants . The economic and security situation is not suitable and these factors have a direct effect on how we care for the environment .
The most important factor in environmental improvement is the lack of the required knowledge among the local people .
Based on necessity , the people and government of this town together effectually take care of the environment .
The municipality of the town collects the garbage from the streets and roads and ships it to a
special area .
Fortunately , Kabul is surrounded by mountains and has a mountainous climate . This town has approximately 15 mm of rain per year . The remarkable agricultural area and forestry all around the town have a positive effect on Kabul 's environment and produces fresh air for the citizens of the town .
Public transport is busy nowadays .
More people are using it and it is getting rush .
It is creating a lot of problems by standing on the edge of the buses and metros .
Actually , there are a lot of kinds of sports that I like , but the most interesting sport for me is football .
Usually , I play football with my friends in a stadium .
I suggest you do sports because it makes us healthy .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am interested in working with you .
This is an excellent opportunity for me because I want to work as an English teacher .
I studied in an English school and have been learning English since I was a child . My teachers were all native speakers and I always practised my English with them .
Later , I studied to be an English teacher at the university of Extremadura .
I am an English teacher now .
They learn and understand English very well .
I worked in the English holiday school this year and I have learned a lot through this experience .
I organized activities like sports , visits to cities , festivals , etc .
I love being with them ; they help me to do my work , they teach me to be a better person . I have more patience now and I know how to be happy .
I live alone , so I always cook my own food .
Cooking is one of my hobbies . I like to eat very well and I cook several kinds of foods .
I think that I am the right person for your job because I have all that you are looking for .
I look forward to your reply .
Yours Faithfully
Everyone has their favorite sports .
One person likes going hiking , others likes dancing , still others like playing
And , so do I. I also like sports .
The one which I like most is badminton .
Why is my favorite sport badminton ?
There are a number of reasons .
Second , playing badminton can activate your whole body , like hands , arms , feet .
play it with someone , whether just for fun or for a competition , my body feels so hot in thirty minutes .
Then , it can be played indoors , and it can be played in the sun .
Playing badminton can do lots of great things for you . Apart from being good for your health , it can also be a lot
of fun and you can play with family or friends happily .
If someone asked me what the best sport is , I would say :
badminton is .
My favourite sport is badminton because I used to play it when I was a child and I loved it .
It seems to me a complete sport , because you can play it in pairs or in an individual way .
You have to be able to play for a long time , to analyze your opponent 's mistakes to win and to have the measure of your energy so as not to be exhausted before the match is over .
For someone who is starting this sport I would give just one piece of advice : enjoy yourself .
Because if you are trying to win , you will lose the most important thing : discovering how wonderful playing a sport can be .
Nowadays , young people are influenced by the western culture , so they are getting more fashion - conscious . Youngsters are interested in wearing different stylish and colorful clothes . They are happy about wearing different color clothes . They do n't want to wear our traditional dress , such as sari , dhoti , choli and many more . They only like to wear shirts , pants , skirts , t - shirts and many more . Youngsters are influenced by watching different programmes on television .
Sport is an important part of my life .
Two years ago , when I was still in school .
But I could n't go with them at the time . I was sick a lot .
One day , my friend invited me to karate .
It was strange , because I never went to sports .
After After one month , my instructor told me that I would enter the competition .
I was very worried and nervous .
The day of the competition arrived and I went with others to show how I 'd practiced .
Then instructor said my name and I went out on the Tatami . When I left I had a special feeling ; many people were looking and clapping .
It took 3 minutes . I won with three accounts too .
I . I was very happy because it was my first competition .
Then as always , they played the Kazakhstan national anthem .
This time I felt like a Champion . It was a really special feeling .
When I go to karate I 'm not even sick .
Sport has given me a boost of vitality , energy , and optimism and strengthened my immune system .
My most exciting day was June 8th 2014 ; an international competition in Belgium .
The day before , there were the qualifiers , which I passed .
The day of the finals , I was so nervous , but determined .
There were athletes who were European champions and I gathered all my courage and I did my exercises very well , except for a fall from the beam .
After the competition I was relaxed and happy , because I had done my job .
In the end , I placed 7th for both beam and floor , and after we took the photos , I went back to the changing room .
When I left , some girls were outside of the dressing room with a sheet of paper and a pen in their hands and they asked me for an autograph .
I was really surprised and happy . I would never have thought that could happen !
The little girls thanked me , then I went to eat with my team and the day after we went back to Italy .
An easy recipe is cookies .
Mix the butter , eggs and vanilla .
The mixture must be smooth and compact . Pour the chocolate and cut the cookies into a round shape .
Bake them for 15 minutes .
I am writing with regard to finding accounting services for my company .

I need my employees to be punctual and that they have responsibility in their job because we are talking about the money of the company .
Thank you for your help and I hope you will find the best company for me .
The world is changing .
Technologies are moving on at high speed .
As the technological world is moving fast , the automobile industry is also coming up with new types of cars & scooters that work in very economical way .
Buying cars and scooters is more convenient than in the last decade .
In a few decades , people 's earnings and lifestyles have also changed .
People now buy cars and scooters according to their convenience and pocket .
Previously , people used to use buses , taxis , autos for going to offices , schools , colleges , shopping etc .
Which was a time - consuming and obviously cheaper way of commuting from one place to another .
Since the world of today is a time - saving world , people do n't care about their pocket .
Using private vehicles is more convenient for them than using public transport .
So public transport 's importance is decreasing every day .
If it so there will come a time when individual people will not be interested in public transport .
This has a tremendous impact on other aspects of life .
Fuel consumption has increased in a few years .
The number of cars and motorbikes is the reason for heavy traffic everywhere .
The rate of road accidents has increased in a few decades .
People do not even care about safety parameters while driving on the roads .
I must say that public transport is a lifeline in today 's world .
Public transport is a very useful resource . You can travel without polluting the atmosphere and it is very cheap .
But , why will it disappear ?
Nowadays , we usually travel very often to many different places , so for us , it is more comfortable to travel in our cars , but for the atmosphere and for our wallets , it is n't .
Using public transport we will avoid traffic and so many accidents , so why do n't we use it more ?
It would be a great advance for people and for the atmosphere , and for countries as well , because we will save a lot of money .
I think that family members ca n't be friends because the relationship is very different .
Firstly , family is the basis of the relationship .
Secondly , although friendship and love are the most important feelings , the family structures the person and influences their behavior .
I feel about my family in a different way from my friends .
Although I have a good relationship with my parents , I could n't think of them as friends .
Some people think that this is possible , but I disagree because it confuses roles in the family .
The parents have to give education to the children and , obviously , love .
In conclusion , I think that the two relationships are different .
Perhaps I think that this statement is false because I think this statement should say that public transport is going to exist in the future because travelling by car is not so much more convenient .
I think that travelling by car is good because you have your own seat and in the winter your car is hot and you can also listen to the radio .
On public transport , you do n't have your own seat , so sometimes you travel standing up , which is not very comfortable , and in winter you do n't have air conditioning , so if it 's cold outside , it 's cold inside too . Sometimes you have to travel with sick people that can transmit the illness to you .
On the other hand , public transport does n't pollute , but the car pollutes , so , for us , travelling by car is better than travelling by public transport , but for the atmosphere , it is better to travel by public transport than to travel by car .
The walls are green and blue . On the green wall there are some of my photos , and on the wall there are some photos belonging to my brother .
There is a bedside table between two beds . On this there are the alarm clock and the books that we are reading .
There are two wardrobes ; one for me and one for my brother .
There is a stereo system on the bench and arranged around the room there are a lot of puppets .
Near my bedroom , there is a little room . In that room there are my red desk , a white bookshelf and a globe .
Hello , my name is Habiba Hamdy . I am fifteen years old and I live in Egypt .
I like English very much . I like learning new languages and things .
I am not a fluent speaker of English but I hope that I will be one day .
What makes me like learning new languages is how it helps me communicate with others easily . I also like traveling so much , as it makes me see new places and learn more about other countries around the world and their cultures and traditions . However , I do n't travel outside my country because I am a student and I do n't have my own money which I can spend on whatever I like .
My dream for when I grow up is that I will travel a lot around the world , marry a romantic , funny person , have a good life and be a good mother like my mother .
Years ago I was very worried about what would happen in the future .
About the pollution , technology , obesity and other things around the world .
But , these days , people think differently , and are starting to help the world and .
Pollution is a big problem for us and the planet .
In the past , people bought things , and they did n't care how dangerous they were for the planet .
Now , people are more aware and they know how dangerous is for the planet .
Also , TV , radio , the internet , big companies have advertisements about helping the planet .
Moreover , from kindergarten , schools are educating about taking care of the planet , simply by doing things like separating the garbage .
Obesity and other things about help , is a very important topic , because people are dying because of this problem .
For example , the way of preparing food can be dangerous because a lot food has artificial things that are not good for us .
To turn to , already people cook organic food with more natural products without chemicals .
But this kind of food is expensive and people can not buy it .
Technology has good thing and bad sides .
Technology is advancing very fast , in the best way . This is good for us because we will do a lot of things .
Maybe , in 2060 , we will be able to go to the moon very easily , like going to Europe .
Also , cars will fly , and maybe that will be better for the city .
In conclusion , I think that we are on track for the next years .
Compared with the past , people are more aware and are worried about the world .
As a result of that , we will have a better life , more healthy and clean in the coming years .
I hope things will continue in this way because it is our future , our life and we have to take care of it to have a good and happy life in the coming years .
No one can deny the importance of public transport , but actually this importance is turn to private sector transport .
And this importance of private transport is because private transportation provides a comfortable way to move from one place to another . Also , it helps to save time and reduce costs spent in public transportation .
Firstly , private transport provides a comfortable way to travel from one place to another without sharing with strange people and , by using this kind of transport , is also convenient because you are free to choose the time of a trip .
Secondly , it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting time waiting for a specific time to move or even waste time waiting for a public transportation vehicle to reach all the points it has to go to , but on the other hand , when you have your own transport or private transport , you get the right to choose the time of your trip or when you want to move or stay , and nowadays , we can not afford to waste our time taking public transport .
Finally , public transport involves more costs , because public transport ( such a buses , trains ) fares are increasing every year , and we do not face this problem with private transport .
The main goal of the thesis is to discuss the three different children 's editions of The Dream of the Red Chamber : Tian Wei edition , Jia Wen edition and Feng Che edition as the object of research .
To begin with , the Li Ren edition of The Dream of the Red Chamber has 120 units .
In comparison with the Li Ren edition , the three children 's editions have some dissimilarities in plot , title , topic , character , language and so on .
We will discuss how to present the features in different aspects such as education , entertainment , literature and children .
Besides , an adaptation is connected with the Li Ren edition .
It can help readers to feel the culture and traits in the Qing Dynasty .
This graph shows people from India , Pakistan and the West Indies who entered the UK from 1940 to 1970 .
People from India and Pakistan coming to the UK significantly increased by around 10 times in 1970 , compared to 1940 .
Now I will talk about the Daruma , a Japanese restaurant that was a very good experience for me .
First of all , the food was really delicious .
The Yakimeshi , the sushi and all the dishes were like a taste of the real Japan .
Also , you can see how they prepare your food in front of you .
The tables have a grill where the chef does his magic .
That makes anybody feel a new level of pleasure in the same process that everybody repeats everyday , eating .
It was a sunny day , a special day in my life . the day was 29 October 2009 . That day I had a university admission test at Shajalaj university .
Before that day , I was frustrated , so it brings happiness to my mind .
After talking with her for a few minutes , I became so happy .
In fact , I fell in love with her at first sight .
So I was just thinking about how to convince her .
There was no other option for me . I just wanted her . During the exam , I was thinking the whole time about how to communicate with her .
When the examination was over , again , I started to talk with her , asking her her exam was .
She told me not good at all , but mine was good and she also added that I might get the chance , and finally I got it .
Three days later , our results were published and I got the chance but the girl did n't .
Then I became so unhappy .
I thought if both of us got the chance , then it would be very good .
But , alas , my dream did n't come true .
When I was returning from Syleth , I called the girl and talked to her and told her that I had got chance at university , but the girl said that she knew .
I have my cousin 's wedding next month too , so I am very excited .
Well , weddings in my country are usually celebrated in a church .
The bride wears a long white dress and the groom wears a black suit .
A lot of people go to a wedding because it 's a very important moment for the couple , normally about one hundred people .
The food is always in a big restaurant where we eat the best food in the city . I recommend you to come to a Spanish wedding .
I think that 's all . I hope that it will be helpful .
Hello , I 'm Arnau and I am twelve years old . I live in Manresa ( Catalonia ) . I am very hardworking in high school and I 'm funny and very talkative and I 'm not freaky .
I am very tall ( 1,71 m ) , my face is normal , I have brown eyes and black hair , and my nose and mouth are normal .
I 'm really into Ps3 , especially Fifa 15 , and a fan of riding a bike , but I do n't like computer games , they are very boring , but I like chatting on the internet with my friends . Sometimes I like playing on my Ipad .
In my free time I watch TV , I play PS3 , I ride a bike and I sometimes play football in the " camp municipal de la mion " , and my hobby is running in the afternoon with my father . I spend money on clothes and I sometimes spend money on PS3 games , and I spend some money on my bike .
I really want to meet boys and girls from different countries of the world . I 'm really interested in practicing English and I want to learn Chinese and Russian . I 'm really interested in learning languages .
Now it is the holidays and we need or we want to visit places around the country .
Well , I will explain in this article about one museum that is considered " The Best in Mexico " , but why ?
The answer is simple ; this museum has many types of momias .
In 1810 , there was a war for independence in Mexico and many people fought with other people . For example , Miguel Hidalgo is considered " The father of independence " and he fought with the Spanish monarchy .
He gave arms to the whole city .
Later he was killed and he rests in peace in this museum like other famous people from that war .
The Museum is in Guanajuato , Guanajuato .
You should knew that the price to visit the museum is very cheap : $ 15.00 for an hour . If you want to spend more time , the price increases by $ 10.00 .
The museum is the most interesting place in my country because it describes the history of our country .
Finally , you can enjoy the museum with all the family and you can invite some people from other cities or other countries .
My favourite sport is football . I love football because it involves two teams .
Being a two team sport makes the game competitive and interesting .
I am an Arsenal fc fan .
I have been an Arsenal fan since 1999 .
He is a good coach but he does n't like to buy experienced footballers .
Buying cheap footballers has wrecked the Arsenal team several times because of the lack of experience of the cheap players .
Football is an important sport that unites nations .
It brings unity between countries .
People from different cultures play in the same club .
The World Cup unites the world .
Hello ,
Mine was badminton and I really enjoyed it when I was playing .
It is one of the best exercises for anybody who wants to get thin .
When I am on the court , my opponents fear my service and I am very at my position to cover the entire court .
Coming to the infrastructure of badminton , it is all about the cock and the racquets .
The court holds 2 players or 4 players , depending on the court .
Each team has 1 or 2 players ,
and the court has one net in between those players .
They have to hit the cock over the net .
If the cock touches that net , it counts as a point to the other team , who can receive from the cock .
At present , many people think that English is the world language and it is absolutely an essential skill to communicate with people from other countries .
For this reason , Taiwanese parents do not want their kids to be behind others . Therefore , many kindergartens have started to teach children English .
It 's December .
But in my city there is no snow .
In the streets it is a little warm .
Yesterday it was very windy and 2 days ago there was heavy rain .
Not all of Russia is always under snow .
Michael just felt nothing different to usual . He was on his way to school .
He went through the park where children were playing around .
He saw some street performer on the street .
Everything seemed so fine , and nothing was wrong , anyway .
He loves music so much that he turned down other courses , just concentrating on music .
He learns how to compose and plays some kind of ancient instrument .
The teacher says that Michael is gifted and talented .
Meanwhile , Michael is also a sensitive guy .
At first , he just pretended nothing was happening .
After that , he changed his mind , and he turned back to give the guy some money .
He thought that he had done the right thing , then went back home .
It is a commodity which serves the dual purpose of both education and entertainment at one and the same time .
The TV shows broadcast on television play a vital role in shaping the thoughts of the viewers .
I think , I can agree with the opinion that shopping is not always enjoyable .
In my opinion , it is dependent on what we buy and with whom we go shopping .
To tell the truth , shopping is so boring for men , particularly when they go to the store with women .
Then they are always screaming and yelling like wild goats .
When I hear this , I want to commit hara - kiri .
Why do we use public transport ? Some of us use it to save money by not buying gas or because they ca n't buy a car or if they have problems with their cars or they are n't in the mood to drive .
Nowadays , with technology , we have different ways to get around , like hoverboards , skateboards , and maybe it means there is no future for public transport .
Another point is that we have our own cars and it 's more comfortable . I do n't have to wait in line to buy tickets .
I do n't have to be late because of the delays . I can do anything in my own car . I can put music on , I can drink , eat , speak or wherever .
I do n't really have an opinion , I just do n't know . We will have to wait and find out .
Tell me your opinions on this subject in comments .
We are living in a rush world .
In my opinion , it has to be like brushing our teeth .
My hygiene is running , or the more familiar word is jogging .
I can say that it is the most natural movement for humans .
All that you need to become a runner is motivation and a plan .
That is what happened with me personally .
Motivation for me was a 15k race .
But I had never before worked out by jogging .
So to finish the competition with pleasure , I needed to work out a plan , which was a day - by - day diary of our jogging distance , time , and mood during our workout .
First of all , it is absolutely minimal . You just need boots for running !
It is one main condition , the rest of your clothing are not important .
Shoes are to protect and prevent your health . You have got only one pair of feet , look after them .
I enjoy my favourite sport because I feel better after jogging , I think better and I meet lovely people because of running .
I will give you a review of a thriller . The thriller is Hunger Games . It is about some capitals and people are chosen to play in a game . You have to kill people before they kill you . It is a movie that has suspense , because you want to know how they survive . In the movie , someone loves someone and they protect each other . It is really cute , but in the 3 movies there are bad moments with the family , capitals , friends , etc .
But you will love the movie and you will want to see others , so go and see that movie .
I would like to explain about my favourite sport , cricket .
Cricket is a sport that has two teams of eleven players each ..
I like cricket very much because playing cricket brings immense pleasure .
Playing cricket also gives physical exercise to our body . we can bowl , bat , field in cricket , which requires a lot of physical activity .
Playing cricket gives relaxation and reduces stress .
I can give advice to people who are interested in playing cricket . They must know all the rules of cricket before playing it .
There are three bunk beds next to some wardrobes .
Finally , there are some posters and some shelves with my games .
This sport is an individual sport , so you win alone and do n't beat a team , but if you play tournaments in pairs the one who wins is the team .
This sport is very famous all over the world , but in Italy it is n't very famous , because in Italy soccer is more famous than tennis .
But I know that a lot of young people play tennis . I hope that Italian tennis players will be very famous all over the world in a few years ' time , then you wo n't wait to sign up to a tennis club and you will become a famous tennis player !
If you start playing tennis you go to a famous tennis club , or you choose the best tennis teacher , who will introduce you to tennis and you will learn the shots , including forehand , backhand , the smash and the service .
So you will become one of the most famous players in the world and you will win a lot of tennis tournaments , including the four slams : the Australian Open , the US open , the Roland Garros and Wimbledon .
In 2 hours , Mary 's plane was leaving and he had to go to the airport to stop her from going to Scotland .
He went to the garage and got on on his motorbike .
Though the road was wet and slippy , he rode his motorbike fast and skilfully , making his way through the other cars and trucks .
It is great when you are in a cup and go very far in the tournament .
It is also really fun to be with everyone who 's in the team .
When you play in a tournament you play a lot of football and you also spend a lot of time with your friends .
When you go far in a tournament , you have to play a lot of games .
If you are going to begin playing football , you need football boots . You also need protection for the legs .
If you are starting this sport , you need to think it 's fun to play it .
If you do n't think it is a fun sport , you should not do it .
You should not play the sport just because your friends are doing it . Do it because you like to play .
I saw your advertisement in a newspaper .
I 'm a young man who finished his studies in tourism and ecology this year .
I have also been a member of the association of tourism and ecology since I was 10 years old .
Also , I have done a climbing course and I have practiced climbing since I was 12 years old .
I have worked for a few different companies and associations in the past .
Usually I was a volunteer , but I was also part of a few European Projects where I was paid for my work .
As a person , I 'm friendly and I like to do my job .
My best leisure time activity would be hanging out with my friends .
l like to go to the beach with my friend or alone often .
I enjoy watching people and children having fun .
l like the cool breeze from the ocean while I 'm walking along the shore and listening to my favorite music .
Hi Alex , I ca n't wait to see you
I really think that we should go to that new centre that you wrote about in your last email and do some of the activities .
I would prefer to do the sailing on the river , because as you know , I never learnt how to ride a bike .
But we could also try the climbing , but it would be better if we could climb outside , in the countryside .
Perhaps on Saturday night we could watch a horror movie , as we both love horror , or a comedy .
But , if we are not too tired at the time , we could go out .
I would really like it if my parents could bring me to your house on Friday evening , but I think that we have a party that night .
But I will try to convince them .
Citizens want , at the same time , efficient and quick means of transportation , personalised solutions to meet their transportation needs , and the cheapest transportation costs .
Hi Isabel .
How are you ? I hope you 're OK .
I have something to tell you .
I am living in New York city ! !
I used to live in Canc√∫n but for my job I had to change cities .
This place has some restaurants and sports bar s where I can talk with Latinos and feel at home .
Email me soon and let me know how you are getting on next holidays .
I think that public transport is much better for the environment than private transport .
If people travelled more often on public transport , we would n't pollute so much .
I think that public transport is the future , because many countries will have to ban entrance to their towns for private cars to stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere , in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens .
So I do not agree with this affirmation . In my opinion , travelling by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than using public transport .
After that kiss , Elizabeth was very surprised , but Jason was a little bit stiff .
Maybe he is sorry she thought , but why if she is perfect , she is everything that a man could want . So what was happening .
-Oh , erm- He gets a little bit red in the face- I ‚Ä¶ erm , I am sorry ! - He screams and his face goes totally red .
He seems different . She never imagined that Jason could be like that . She imagined someone brave and strong , and she never foresaw something like this . But she felt something for him , maybe she is in love with this guy .
-I'm sorry - he repeats again , but more serious and with his normal face - It 's because , well it , was my first kiss OK ! ? I can fight with Bloutums , Dragons , Two - Headed snakes and everything that you can imagine .
But these thoughts of l ‚Ä¶ lo ‚Ä¶ love , can make me very nervous- the blush comes again .
- Haha!- she smiles - it 's ok , do n't worry , it was my first kiss too , and I liked it . She smiles again , but this time , the smile seems false .
Elizabeth seems to be a very sweet girl , but Jason is not convinced , because when he kissed her , he did n't feel anything , he did n't feel that the ground disappeared , and when his face turned red , he just put a face of horror and surprise , like she was very sorry for kissing him .
Almost at the same time , they kissed .
-Hey , do n't run Snow .
- But it 's very late Margarita , OMGG ( Oh my green god ) , it is very late . I 'm gon na die .
They stop in a dressmaker 's market .
-Why are we here ? - Margarita asks .
- I 'm gon na give information to Lucresia .
- Prince Jason is here .
Who is he ?
- The prince of Blue City . He is very handsome , and his family has military studies , so he is the second most perfect guy in the world .
-Who is he ?
- I 'll tell you later .
When they entered the dressmaker 's market , Lucresia was n't there .
But there were a lot of beautiful dresses in high - tech closets with lights .
-These dresses are made of textile fiber . Almost everything here is synthetic and wearable for everyone - explained Snow .
- Wow , everything is beautiful , it makes me feel like I am suspended in a dream or fairytale .
- Do you want to wear one ?
- But are you sure ?
-Yes , just wait . In a fraction of a second , you will be ready .
I run every day .
When I am running , I feel relaxed .
Moreover , when I am running , I can think through a lot of things about myself or how to solve some of the problems of daily life .
Therefore , running can let me feel happy .
In the past , cars were only affordable for the upper classes , while for the middle class and lower there were not many choices for them besides walking and public transportation .
Once technology and the standard of living are improved , many people left the traditional habit of using public transportation and chose the car for several reasons .
The first one is to save time .
As we know , public transportation is not a direct way to get to all our destinations and it forces us to stop at many stops first . Moreover we have to take another one to reach our destination , so it is already obvious why using a car is better .
Secondly , public transportation is usually very crowded and makes us not feel safe , since there is an opportunity for us to be robbed .
Then , by car , we can enjoy the scenery , share a laugh , change our destination all of a sudden and many more .
For these reasons , it can not be doubted that people think a car is more comfortable to use rather than public transportation .
Since cars are affordable nowadays , a family can have more than one . That makes the number of cars grow rapidly , but they do not think about the negative side effects that a car has .
Firstly , it leads to global warming , since the concentration of pollution is higher in many countries , and actually it is not only leading to but also making global warming faster and can also threaten our health .
Then roads are more crowded right now and there is so much traffic , so people waste more time on the road , then it makes one of the positive points of using a car disappear and the importance of public transportation is needed .
While in the statement it says that public transportation will be abandoned by many people , in my opinion , the opposite is true - that public transportation is our future .
It can be proved now that the willingness of people to use public transportation is higher . Besides , it is not as costly as using a car , and the quality of public transportation has improved , so citizens have no worries about using it .
There are n't any animals on the farm .
That is hardly surprising , it has been closed since 2005 .
You 'll have to take the bull by the horns and get some work done !
In the future , people will go out of the Earth . Because of the damage , people on the ground ca n't survive .
Even the grass ca n't live on earth .
Thought , but most people will not be members of the team who are alive .
Cause there was lots of damage , but they did n't take responsibility .
And . And I do n't know if they will change their minds in the next fifty years .
Firstly , I agree about learning different concepts , because you can analyse different opinions .
But you need to understand the main idea .
In other words , some professors , when teaching different topics , explain the concepts and it 's difficult to learn .
Sometimes it 's so difficult to say the same words for the students . I recommend reading different ideas .
Anyway , if you read different books , you can understand better .
In conclusion , it 's more important to learn the concept than to say something stupid ....
So , if you need techniques for learning , you need to analyse and create your own words , this way you will never forget this definition .
All about me
Hi , my name is Leon Johnson . I am 13 years and I live in Stocksund Sweden .
I was born at Danderyds hospital , in 2003 on the 5th of September .
I have one sister who is ten years old and one brother who is five years old .
One of the best places I have ever visited is Leksand , in Dalarna .
( It is my country place . ) I like it because it is near the water and we have a big lawn where we play football , volleyball and have fun .
Three words that describe me are : sporty , friendly and happy .
One of my favourite books is Diary of a Wimpy Kid .
My favourite subjects at school are mathematics , geography , and , of course , English .
The location of the restaurant is fantastic , right in the centre of the city , and with plenty of space for parking .
The decor is not too modern , but not too classic . It has a comfortable atmosphere .
The menu is very well constructed , and the food is based on local products .
The prices are more than good if you consider the high quality of the dishes .
Dear Mr Sotelo ,
In the gym there are many people .
On the days that we have to do sports , if the weather is good , we do it outside , but if the weather is bad , we have to do them in the gym .
On those days , there are a lot of people and classes at the same time and sometimes we ca n't have the class comfortably .
Apart from this problem , we have another problem that is important too .
This problem is that some apparatus are broken and the paint is bad .
For me , the solutions to these problems are easy .
With the first problem , you should organise the timetable in order to have one class at a time .
And the solution to the second problem is that you should do maintenance once a year .
I look forward to your positive answer .
Yours sincerely , Maximiliano Khachaturyan .
Dear Mrs Gate
I 'm so glad to hear from you and I also would like you to know that your idea for our new school project is really interesting .
I am excited about the idea of being with and interviewing other students from different parts of the world .
June 21st is impossible for me because I have an appointment with Mr Set , my dentist . Can we set the meeting for the next week ?
In the last year sales at Benton Electronics in the first quarter of the year were 500 and they increased to 620 in the second quarter . In the third quarter , sales stayed at 620 and in the last quarter of the year sales went down very quickly to 420 . As you can see , sales were very unstable .
I just want to express what I think is painful , and I think coming back to your own home after many years of being away and seeing your closest person has departed is the most painful feeling ever .
Good evening , my name is Lydia , I am a newcomer to IMAS .
It 's my pleasure to join you here . My major is actually not relevant to Social Sciences . I really want to learn more about the research methodology of social sciences .
I think it will be helpful to me taking this lesson at the beginning of the semester . I believe I can learn a lot from the professor and you guys .
My Life at University
Life at university involves a lot of difficult and interesting things .
Of course , everything always have two sides .
Now that I live at university , my life has changed a lot .
Firstly , studying is very difficult because you have to accept new ways of studying - studying by yourself .
In addition , my major is English , so teachers teach and explain in English , and I could n't keep up with lessons well at first .
I was very unsure of myself and I could n't make friends well , so I think that it was too difficult to ask teachers or friends .
I always try to find out reasons , which takes a lot of time .
Moreover , I need to improve my skills , such as reading , listening , writing , and speaking . They help me to keep up with my teacher ' s lessons .
Secondly , studying at university , I have to live a long way from home , which makes me homesick , sad , and worried . I have to live in a dormitory with many strange people . They 're very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates .
Everyday , I have to clean our room , wash clothes . I have to spend a lot of time finishing everything before I start studying .
When I first lived here , I used to call my family and complain about life here .
However , university life has many conveniences .
Before I want to pay for something , I always think carefully about whether it 's really necessary or not .
Sometimes , I nearly ran out of money and I was really worried , so I have to spend money sensibly .
Living alone , I have to save money , because there are many situations which I have to deal with without family , and you can become a good person with many good characteristics , such as confidence , independence , friendliness .
Because my family always did everything for me when I lived with them , it 's very difficult to be independent .
But today , I have to do it , I have to solve my problems , manage money , wash clothes by myself .
In addition , I can be confident because teachers require everybody in class to stand in front of the class and speak English .
Living alone , you have to make friends when you 're sad .
Learning new lessons from society .
Jogging : the sport in nature
While I am jogging , I can think about all the daily things in my life .
When I am in a bad mood , I go jogging outside and hear the birds singing .
For me , jogging is very stressless .
On one day I might go alone , so I can calm down or think things through .
On another day , I go jogging with my best friend , so we talk a lot and have fun while we do sport .
Jogging is a sport you can start any day .
You do n't need a lot of equipment , so you do n't have to buy a lot .
I think for people who are fat , they can go jogging , but a little bit slower .
You have to consider this and go jogging tomorrow .
It is a hot summer 's day and Agatha has just switched off the computer in her office to go back home .
Suddenly , Agatha sees , through the windows , a 30-year - old man . He 's tall and is wearing 19th century clothes . He is John , a known vampire who lives in that district .
He had come to Agatha 's investigation office to ask her to look into some murders had that happened recently .
Four vampires had been murdered .
Agatha knows that John is a dangerous man , so she decides to refuse the case .
After the agreement , Agatha goes back home and immediately calls her friend Michael to tell him to come to her house .
When he arrives she tells him about the occurrence .
Michael , who is a policeman , decides to help her .
Two weeks later , Agatha meets John in the old palace 's cellar .
Accompanied by Michael , she goes to him and gives him all the documents she has found .
Unfortunately , Agatha ca n't find sufficient clues to identify the guilty party .
Irritated , John understands Agatha 's difficulties and , before going away , he calls Agatha without Michael to tell her another important thing .
While Michael goes out , a red light appears in John 's eyes .
We had had lunch , so we started a little walk .
Then we saw an eagle flying in the sky .
We had never seen such a beautiful eagle as that .
Suddenly , when he was trying to focus on the eagle with the camera , he fell .
Another reason is that you can listen to the music that you like in your car .
My name is Monika and I 'm 21 years old .
I have a lot of interests , but my favourite is volleyball .
Volleyball is a discipline which I have been practising for 6 years .
An important place in my country is the Museum of Prado because it is full of many world famous paintings .
It 's very large and has special lights in the Greek performers ' room mainly .
This museum houses the historical collection of the Spanish royal family from many centuries ago to the present time .
There you can see some of the greatest teachers painters .
The car is very easy .
I have a car and I can go to a lot of places , because it is fast .
The public transport is slow and has got a lot of people .
I prefer walking , because the bus , helicopter , and metro are very polluting .
The pollution is the first problem with public transport
A long time ago , in a small village in Spain , the story I 'm going to tell you happened .
A man called Michael gave us a new machine to wash our clothes .
He tried to switch it on again and again , but the machine did n't work .
Suddenly , a man in black told us that we should plug the machine into the electricity .
Michael 's face was awfully red .
Good morning everyone and welcome to your favorite program " You can also do so " . Today we 're going to learn how to make a cake for children 's birthdays , and Sofia will tell us what ingredients we are going to need to be able to make the cake .
hello John good days and what we need to make this delicious cake is : eggs , flour , yeast , sugar , and the flavoring for the cake that we want , such as chocolate , vanilla , fruit .
While I was ringing the bell , the neighbour 's dog started to bark .
It looked afraid and nervous .
It was like it was waiting for a terrifying event .
I stood in front of the door for forty minutes and I rang again and again .
Nobody opened .
I had called Michael that morning and I told him that I would go to his house that evening .
I would expect that he was waiting for me .
I looked through the windows and I could see a suspicious shadow .
I thought he might be Michael and I started to shout his name .
When Michael saw me , he opened the door , but straightaway closed the door and at that moment knew he had make a mistake .
I am writing to you to apply for the position at a summer camp as advertised in the newspaper .
I am an architect . I have 5 years of professional experience .
There are many sports and my favourite sport is badminton . I liked it when I was young .
I remember that the first present my mother gave me was a badminton racket .
Because I did n't know how to use it .
From that day , my older brother taught me to play it .
I often play it for about 2 hours in the afternoon .
And now , if one day I do n't have any practice , I feel bored .
As you know , doing sports gives us many benefits . You can join a club and have more friends .
Moreover , if you have good ability , you can compete in a competition to try your best . I am a member of a Badminton club in the city . If you 're interested in badminton , come and enjoy yourself .
Thanks for your letter asking about what the young people are interested in .
Saying that , the music that they like is pop music and reggaeton as they can dance together .
Also , the television programmes that they watch are reality shows .
These programmes are fashionable .
In addition , regarding clothes , young people wear a dress , skirt or jeans .
Everyone wears what he wants .
My nightmare journey took place in August 2011 .
My family and I were returning from a holiday that we spent at the seaside .
We were going to Gda≈Ñsk to see the new stadium that was built for the UEFA European Championship .
We saw the stadium , returned to the car and wanted to drive to Bydgoszcz .
Bydgoszcz is my hometown and the destination of this journey .
Sadly our car broke down ... at a big and busy intersection !
This was n't some big , we still had four wheels and a motor , but the electronics in the car stopped working .
This was very scary !
We did n't have a speedometer , blinkers and lights ; it was a very dangerous situation .
We stopped on the side of the road and looked for a solution .
My father rang friends but unfortunately no one could help us .
We had to take a risk and went to the nearest market .
In the car park in front of this building a very nice and crazy old man helped us and charged the accumulator in our car .
This worked and we could return to driving .
We were very scared because the car could break down again at any moment .
For this reason , we did n't use a motorway .
Fortunately , we returned home healthy and happy but very very tired .
To pursue a career which is relevant to the field of Mechanics and expect myself to contribute my experiences and knowledge with enthusiasm and I would love to have challenges and yearn for the sense of accomplishment .
This report shows the sorts of shops which are located in Moral de Calatrava .
It is thought that Chinese shops are the cheapest by far .
But maybe , the most important thing is the variety of products which can be found there : from cleaning products to furniture .
2 . Fashion in small towns .
Traditional clothes : that kind of clothing can be expensive , but if you want to live like in the past , you can put on those clothes and you will have great fun although those clothes went out of style many years ago .
Something more fashionable : there are also a few clothes shop where you can find a lot of by fashionable Italian and Spanish designers .
If you need something for a special event like a wedding , you can go to three shops which are specialised in that .
3 . Farmer 's markets .
Every Saturday morning , this village organizes a market where people can buy some natural vegetables or fruit which have been grown by local farmers .
That is the reason why their price is so low .
-Even though you can find a lot of bargains , do n't spend too much if you do n't need to .
If you look like a foreign person , local people could try to rip you off .
My town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment . They provide us with good buses , which are friends to the environment , and offer the tickets for these buses at a cheap price . They also try to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by recycling . Also , people try all the time to find the best way to keep our village clean ; they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens . They also take care of the fuel in their cars to not be bad for the environment . So , it 's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment alongside the government .
There are many accidental problems encountered by international students studying in Australia .
It is believed that the most important one is the culture barrier .
Because of different cultural backgrounds , the speaking styles of international students who come from different countries are different .
For example , people always walk on the right of the road in China . However , Australian rules specify that citizens drive on the left of the road .
Secondly , loneliness can be a big problem when a person leaves their own country , going away from family members and close friends .
Thirdly , students may not be accustomed to western eating habits , like burgers , pizza and bread . Because of the unfamiliar environment , students may lack a sense of security .
The most important way is that individuals should participate in student activities which are held by students of the same nationality , so that they may not feel lonely . At the same time , they can also actively communicate with local students to acquire more information about Australian culture , in order to fit in quickly .
It would be fantastic to spend this summer in the USA .
I 'm studying teaching at college because I want to be a teacher .
When I finish my studies I will spend long hours with children .
My best skills are dealing with people as well as being able to do two things at the same time .
I take care of them and it makes me feel like a useful person .
I have been thinking about some ideas to help you to organize some sports or evening activities .
For instance , we could go swimming at the beach .
In the evenings we could tell them horror histories . Also , we could play with gestures .
In addition , we could play outdoor games and they could do landscape painting .
About working in the kitchen . It is n't a problem for me because I love cooking .
I am willing to cook a lot of different meals for them .
I used to work in a restaurant in Salou and it was quite satisfying .
I enjoy cooking , so I always make different kinds of food .
I think that I 'm a suitable person to look after them because I am quite responsible .
I 'm an energetic and responsible person .
If you have more questions about me , I 'd be glad to answer them .
I 'm a hard - working person , so that 's why I never have time to relax .
As children love playing , I think that I am a suitable person to do this because I am like a little girl .
If you give me a chance I will be very pleased .
My name is Margarita Varela and I 'm interested in the Summer camp Assistant 's position .
I am a responsible person who can cope in a crisis .
I took a First Aid course last year in order to know what to do in case of unexpected accidents .
Also , I have good social skills and can speak two languages ; English and Spanish .
Then , I was wondering if food , accommodation and expenses are covered by you , or do you give any kind of help to your employees ? I would appreciate it a lot if you sent me this information .
The game of gentlemen is my favourite game . Yes , I mean cricket .
In my country , we follow cricket like a religion .
Cricket is played by 11 players , which includes a captain , a wicket keeper and the rest are batsmen and bowlers .
A player who can bat and bowl is called an all - rounder .
This game is played in three format i.e. Test Cricket ( 5 day game ) , One day Cricket , and Twenty - Twenty .
Test cricket is an old format and I love this format as it really tests the players ' skills and only the best player can achieve success in this format .
But as this takes 5 days , many people do n't have time to watch this game and its losing its popularity with the younger generation .
My favourite sport is football . I think this game is the most enjoyable .
Its popularity has spread all over the world too .
There are many reasons behind it being popular .
Everyone is able to enjoy the excitement throughout this game .
People who are eager to play football must follow some basic rules which are described below :
1 . A football player should be punctual and hard - working .
2 . He should be disciplined .
3 . During his playing time , he must give his full concentration .
Hi , I 'm Sangjin .
Do you have any different eating customs ?
If you have any special eating customs , will you tell me ?
It 's my project .
So . I need more information about eating customs in different countries .
In Korea , we usually use chopsticks when we eat meals and spoons as well .
Have you ever used chopsticks ?
It may be difficult for you .
When I was young , I could n't use them .
So , I have to learn to use chopsticks to eat .
Also ,
we have meal manners .
When we have a meal , we ca n't eat before our parents and older people start to eat .
We think it 's important to respect meal manners .
Have you ever heard of stamina food ?
When you feel really weak .
We have many stamina foods . I think dog meat is a better stamina food than another meats .
This is because , when I was young , my parents fed it to me every summer season .
And they said it 's really good for your health .
So , I have eaten it every summer for 12 years .
I have to present this project next Monday .
So , tell me as soon as possible about your country 's special eating customs and manners , and stamina food as well .
I think that for people who want to learn English Write and Improve is great !
I like it very much . It is very useful for me .
I tried it last weekend and I will use it every day ! if I used it every day , I would improve in a short time !
There is no doubt that man 's lives have evolved .
All thanks to new technologies , innovation in the field of medicine and new scientific discoveries .
To my mind , our lives have been improved in these years by smartphones , satnav , digital TV , the Internet ..
Let 's imagine a twenty - first century teenager in the Middle Ages . do n't get out alive without Wi - fii !
First of all , in the next 50 years people 's lives wo n't resemble at all this .
As far as I 'm concerned , we will be submerged by too many tools which will replace manpower and craft . In addition , globalization will destroy the cultural traditions of each country .
On the one hand , I 'm for progress . On the other hand , I hope that the new will not destroy the old .
Often , evolution is a return to origins , but I hope that man in the coming years will not forget the past .
Apart from that , I imagine the world with everything automatic , planes that take me from New York to Dubai in three hours and robots instead of waiters in a restaurant .
To conclude , I ca n't think what wonderful things man will do , but I hope they make the world even better !
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I have read the advertisement and I promise you that I am perfect for this post .
and I know how to take care of a camp . I 'm funny and cheerful , but I 'm also professional , so I know how to take care of children .
I am an experienced cook , so I can also cook for the children . I am also a good singer , so we can sing songs together with the children .
I can not agree with the statement that there is " no future for public transport " given that the premise is " travelling by car is more convenient " .
First of all , public transport is rather more convenient than a private car .
The subway reaches most parts of London , and people can travel to many places .
The environment is becoming a more and more burning issue , , especially from many years to nowadays .
That 's because pollution has now reached critical levels and that 's why we must get it under control and solve it .
We already know that a great part of the pollution comes from the exhaust fumes of the transport that invades cities worldwide .
However , we can already fight this - waiting for the development of advanced technology which can better exploit renewable , sustainable energy . For example , taking advantage of public transport .
Apart from that , even greater is the pollution of the seas and rivers .
This is caused by the waste from factories , but also by the damage that tankers do not only to the sea , but to the mainland too .
In addition , what about domestic waste , which is our reality ? We should all learn to manage our waste , because each of us , in our own small way , is a great threat to the environment .
In conclusion , I think it is never too late to save our wonderful world .
Well , in my hometown there are about a little more than half a million people .
But if you leave the city and travel about 30 km , there are a lot of rivers and waterfalls .
When you have the skill to read a book and , in that moment , you are searching for a good job , you can find a lot of jobs because you can develop easily when you compare yourself with another person who has been searching for a job too
My favourite restaurant is in Modugno .
It 's located in a quiet street , so the restaurant is often very relaxing , especially between 8 and 9 pm .
The furniture consists of a set of chairs , tables and some sofas , covered with red cloths .
The restaurant looks very elegant and traditional .
The owner prefers to leave only the TV on , but often the dining room is silent .
Despite this , the restaurant is decorated with a full set of musical instruments , hung up on the walls .
I really like it , because I love music and I enjoy trying to guess which instrument I 'm looking at .
Everything is delicious and very tasty , especially the pizzas : they dress them in many different ways . I try a different meal every time I go there .
Finally , it is not expensive at all .
She finally felt that she was wanted , that she could do anything she wanted , and that no one is more clever than another , they 're all the same .
The thoughts which people put in her mind were completely wrong . She ca n't deny that those thoughts affected her badly , brought her to the point that they made her hate herself .
The words they said to her were deadly ones , they colored her life black . till it 's the only time to prove to them that she can do anything , she 's good at everything like them all , that she just did n't want to do it like them all as she just hated the way
That 's it , not because of being non - clever .
Being unsuccessful at studying is a horrible thing , it affects people badly .
That was me . I never liked studying , I never found myself in those subjects , but it was n't a big deal to me . I hated being seen as unsuccessful or a loser , as I was n't that . I knew that I was clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks , but they all did n't get that . They judged me for my marks , but marks do n't form brains or thoughts , marks are n't the only way that makes you great now or in the future .
Whatever . In high school , the senior year here in our country identifies your future ; the college you 'll spend your life studying in and working for its knowledge , so I got that I should do my best this year so my future would be better . And it happened . I showed them all that I can do whatever I want , even if the things I was n't like they see me , and that all my previous marks were n't my best . I got a high score and entered The faculty of Engineering , which was the top college .
People 's thoughts have the power to make you feel the best feeling ever and literally the opposite . Just do n't think about anyone 's thoughts but yours , as you have control of your life not anyone else .
Your thoughts are the only ones that will make the difference , so take care only of them and believe in yourself so you can achieve the prestige you 're looking for .
Do n't give anyone the opportunity to make you give up , and continue in a successful life . Fight .
I am Monta√±a Tomaso and I am twenty - four years old .
I read this announcement today .
I would like to play with the children , to do sport and dance with them .
I love cooking .
I hope that we can work together .
I promise that if I go to the camps , we will have a good time and we will laugh a lot .
Although I do n't have a teacher available there , the program helps a lot because the corrections appear at the same time as you check it .
I intend to write every day to practise my writing .
I believe that it 's a good thing to share with everyone .
On our earth , hundreds of millions of people live .
Apart from us . there is also a large amount of wildlife .
All of us need air , water and food .
Humans also want houses , and transport facilities .
A great number of buildings stand on the land ,
even though the place probably should belong to animals .
We build roads for us and make life easy and better .
However , we forget the one important thing : the earth belongs to all life .
Our flats and houses make the other animals lose their homes , and it leads to environmental deterioration .
We make the transport easy . However , we take away other animal s ' lives through carelessness .
THE PERSON I ADMIRE IS MY BROTHER . HE IS THE OLDER THAN MY OTHER BROTHERS . HE WAS BORN IN 1970 . MY PARENTS TELL ME HE WAS A GOOD BOY WHEN HE WAS A CHILD .
THE REASON WHY I ADMIRE HIM IS BECAUSE HE WAS DETERMINED WHEN HE WON A SCHOLARSHIP TO STUDY MEDICINE IN RUSSIA . HE LIVED THERE FOR 7 YEARS .
HE HAD TO LEARN ANOTHER LANGUAGE AND LIVE IN A COUNTRY VERY DIFFERENT TO OURS .
MY PARENTS AND I FEEL PROUD OF HIM .
NOW , HE IS THE BEST MEDICAL INTERNAL . HE HAS A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY .
I live in Taiwan , Taichung .
How does the area take care of the environment ?
It builds a lot of facilities for residents .
For example , lots of bicycles .
This are provided for people who want to go to a place that is not too far away .
And it raises another question : morality .
People probably destroy those bikes , and cause bikes to become less and less .
But , fortunately , people living in this area all use these bikes carefully , so we do n't care so much about that .
The second facility is public buses .
Large numbers of buses all around the city .
When students finish their classes , they take the bus home .
Workers , when they are off duty , take the bus home , too .
Family can take the bus from place to place , instead of driving .
It makes a father or mother 's life more convenient !
Third , lots of green areas .
Taichung has plenty of trees in the park .
So when children are playing around these trees , they can feel more healthy with clean air .
And let 's talk about the bigger area , Taiwan .
Train , bus , Mass Rapid Transit , and aeroplane .
People living in Taiwan , no matter whether you are local people or not , can use all of these facilities .
And lots of city administrations advocate protecting animals .
I am Julia Timmerman from the Netherlands and I read your advertisement about working in summer camps in the USA .
I would really enjoy doing this job in the summer , because I love to look after children , teach them things and do sport with them .
Since I was 13 , I 've been teaching children from 8 - 9 years old how to play hockey and I am still doing and enjoying this .
I also would like to do this because I have always wanted to visit the United States and I love sport .
I can work really hard if it 's needed and am very energetic , so I think and hope I am a suitable person for the job and I would really enjoy the job and looking after children .
When he was 21 years old , his father told him something about his family 's secret .
It 's quite a strange sounds , because his father , grandfather , and great - grandfather had travelled in time .
After the action , he can go to a time in the past .
After he knew the truth , he moved to London for his job .
So he used to his ability to time travel for his family .
After they married , he and his family faced a difficult situation .
He wants to fix the problem , but his father says to him ,
" If you have a great time with your family and co - workers , it is not necessary to time travel .
Just enjoy your life day by day , and be thankful for an ordinary day . "
He realized what that means .
I watched this movie several times after I arrived in the UK .
It 's good for studying English as well as for the plot .
I 'm sure you would like this movie .
This school is located in Marin , which is in northern Spain near Pontevedra .
And it was established in 1943 . Moreover , there are not only the royal navy but also the royal marine corps .
Students have to study two parts , which are the engineering part and the military part .
In the engineering part , there are a lot of laboratories , which help us to easily understand about subjects such as Physics , Chemistry or even Economics .
In the military part , there are many obstacles and weapons for the marine corps .
And there is a lot of equipment for the navy cadets .
For example , the planetarium in a navigation room for learning about the position of stars , four small boats used to practice leadership and navigation in the Pontevedra river , or even the simulation for creating situations which seldom arise .
To sum up , the Spanish military academy has a lot of equipment for teaching future officers .
It gives me a lot of knowledge which I need to use in my future career .
A lot of people use public transport every day in this world , but some people prefer to use their own car to go to work , school , or whatever .
Some people have their own car , but prefer to use public transport .
Today , on the roads there are a lot of cars , buses , motorcycles , and other kinds of transportation .
All people should use their own cars to go somewhere only when it 's necessary , because each car on the road is bad for our environment .
All people should use public transport to reduce the number of cars on the road
I know a good restaurant . Its name is " Moonlight " . It is located in Abbas elakad St.
It is large , clean and comfortable and has air conditioning and internet wifi .
It offers many kinds of delicious foods , like meat , chicken , seafood , and if you want something different , you will find it there . It is suitable for my class because it is different from any other restaurant .
In my city there is an old town which was declared in 1986 World 's Most Beautiful City .
One of the most famous buildings is the Churruca Earl Palace , which has a medieval tower with battlements ( the rest of the towers in the city do not have them because the Muslims took them out ) .
It is also important because , during the Civil War , General Franco lived there for a week .
If you want , you can visit it .
Nowadays , the Palace has a very good restaurant with a comfortable patio where you can taste the most exclusive products from Extremadura .
The present chapter aims to introduce audiovisual translation ( AVT ) - one of the most popular types of translation nowadays .
Audiovisual translation brings a lot of dilemmas and constraints over which translators must agonise .
But there are a variety of techniques which help to tackle these kinds of problems .
The chapter will also cover the definition of the notion of puns as a stylistic feature and how puns are transferred from one language into another .
As an extension of this , I will evaluate whether the effect of the pun in the original version is maintained in the dubbed version .
The garbage cans are around each home .
Garbage trucks pick them up twice a week .
There are many small garbage cans around cafes , stores , and other public places .
Every morning , a special truck cleans the roads and pavements .
The advance of technology in recent years has been awesome .
The first computer was created in 1946 by John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert in the United States .
The keyboard had a lot of buttons and the screen did n't have any colours .
Computers did n't have any programs and as a result were limited , boring and tedious .
These days , computers are multifunctional .
WiFi , USB port , among other things .
They are faster and smaller than before and you need a mouse to use them .
Their screen has colours and HD .
In my last week , I went to Florida with my family .
Then we went to the cinema and saw the Harry Potter film .
My brother went to the NBA league and saw the Arenas vs Orlando match . And now I am going to my house and then I 'm going to invite friends over .
In my opinion , public transport has a future because it is cheaper than other modes of transport , also it pollutes less .
The car is a more comfortable mode of transport than public transport , but it is not sustainable , its cost is higher , and if all people travel by car , the cities will be very polluted .
Also , in the big cities , the public transport is more punctual than the car because public transport usually has its own lane , while if you use a car , you take more time because there is a lot of traffic in your lane .
Another mode of transport that could be commonly used in the future is the bike . This mode of transport is cheap and ecological . Also , more and more the cities are building a lot of bike lanes , so it is a good alternative .
For travelling to other cities or town , in my opinion , the car will remain the most used mode of transport , although new modes of transport could change this situation .
Finally , I think that the most used mode of transport in the cities in the future will be the bus , metro and bike , and for travelling between cities , the car will remain the most used .
Dear James ,
Thank you for inviting me !
It was really enjoyable and fun .
I was especially delighted with the national music and Latin American dances .
Nowadays , more and more people have their own car .
When they go to work or for other purposes , they choose to drive by themselves .
People do n't need to wait for public transport if they are driving their own cars .
It is not only convenient , but also time - saving .
With these benefits , it seems that there will be fewer and fewer people willing to take public transport .
I am writing to you about the advertisement in the Mirror daily newspaper .
I am really very interested in the job on your summer camp . I have worked for seven months in Spain in a similar job .
I can speak several languages , like Spanish , English and Russian .
by the time I have studied for a degree in journalism .
I am available to start to work immediately .
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Your faithfully .
I have played this sport since I was a child , and today I still love it .
The dream of every person that plays this sport , is to make it a profession as well as a hobby , but very few people make it .
Nowadays , I play football twice a week , on Monday and Friday , because for me it has remained a hobby .
I like to play football because , for me , as well as a hobby , it is a way to stand back from the world , from the problems that I have to face every day , and at the end , it makes me calm and happy .
I recommend this sport to everyone , because it could be , as it is for me , a moment to distract you from the world , a moment to spend without thinking about tomorrow .
Football could be one way to meet your friends , and to spend time with them .
Trust me , I 'm right .
My undergraduate studies in Pharmacy at the University of Asia Pacific gave me a solid background in the health care sector and chemistry , as well as a strong theoretical framework , while allowing me to explore my personal interests in pharmaceutical technology .
This undergraduate work along with diversified professional experience helped shape the specific research interests that now drive me to pursue graduate work in the field of industrial pharmacology and gave me the opportunity to learn and work with the new medicines and delivery methods , ensuring their safety and quality academic and research opportunities for my interest in pharmaceuticals as a scientific career .
I am glad to tell you that I am able to come on February 16th at 10:00am . I would appreciate it if you could reserve a parking space for me .
Could you please tell me how long the interview will be ?
The most historical place is the Pyramids . They were built more than 7000 years ago .
If any tourist decides to visit the Pyramids , he / she should enjoy riding a camel , horse or buggy .
Also , taking some pictures will be a great idea .
The pyramids are famous because of the way they were built . It was a great job by the Egyptians .
Many people think that parents are responsible for the bad behaviour of young people and they should be punished for that .
First of all , when children are small , they are polite and always listen to parents . For example , they do homework , go to sleep at regular hours and come back home after school .
This is a time when parents can create behaviour of their children , because when they grow up , they begin to rebel and do things which are good in their opinion .
Secondly , other factors have an impact on the behaviour of older children like teenagers , it is not only their parents but other people , who surround them .
It is a time when children must choose which people are good or bad , and which way they will go in a difficult situation . For example , will they drink alcohol or will they have fun without any stimulants ?
If they choose bad , they could begin to stop doing things which were important to them in previous periods in their lives .
In summary , I would like to point out that the most impact for young people have their own , because life is a time when people only choose .
Parents are very important , because they can suggest some solutions , but final decisions must be taken by their children .
The Great Wall is a great military construction in China , known as a miracle in the history of ancient human construction .
The existing Great Wall was mainly built in the 15th century of Ming . The Great Wall has a total length of 8851.8 kilometres .
It is a symbol of China , along with Tiannanmen Square and the Terra Cotta Warriors and Horses .
The area of the Great Wall has been inhabited by many ethnic groups since ancient times .
The development of each nation and their relationship is the key point to observing and understanding the area of the Great Wall .
This week was a little bit difficult because it was the beginning of classes . I got up early to be on time for my classes and to start with all the enthusiasm in the new semester .
The next day , Tuesday , it was hard for me to get up , but the simple fact of seeing my classmates meant it was so much easier .
I arrived at school with all the energy , and I decided that this semester will be better than the last .
Thus , the classes have just begun with new teachers and others who have already taught me .
What is difficult is that teachers have already given us all the homework for the week .
Later , I went to my house with my mom and I helped her make the meal and did the washing up .
After that , I did my homework because I had a lot of it and it was pretty hard .
So , every day I am kept awake .
My dad told me to do my best and if this semester goes well for me , my dad will give me a tablet , because I really need one .
However , on Saturday I went to English class in the evening .
Later , my parents , my brother and I went to turn around to relax from all the stress of the week .
Finally , on Sunday I rested at home with my family .
Every second , every day , every week , every year , life goes on and humans discover a new thing .
Scientists try to make people 's lives easier , but that 's harmful for people 's health because that makes people not move and get more fat .
In the future , cars will fly and be faster .
We wo n't use oil as a fuel .
We will find new sources of energy which will be clean and cheap .
Renewable and new energy is clean and so cheap , we can use the sun 's rays to generate electricity for houses and cars .
Computers will write what you think , mobiles will be smaller and lighter .
Tourists will travel to other planets . People will live on the moon and under the seas or oceans .
Working as an ITC is very exciting because you need to program everything , it is like a challenge , although you can do different things . You can be on duty in your house and deal with your boss by cellphone , so do n't be alarmed if your children bother you .
It is a little stressful when you have a lot of work . I hope when I have my job I will be in charge of IT department security .
But you want to see all the goods and maybe buy one of the products .
But if you have a lot of money you can go and buy something you really need .
I do n't know my name . I do n't know my age . All I know is that I want to be a great woman . I want the world to hear my voice , to prove that I can do it . I can do anything . I am not weak . I have woman power .
Michael went into the teacher 's office , but he found that his teacher was n't there . Maybe the teacher had gone to the bathroom . Suddenly , the door was opened by a teacher , a teacher who was wearing a bikini came into sight . This incident came as quite a surprise to Michael . She flirted with Michael . Michael felt excited but ran out of the office , but he regretted his action . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
I am so pleased to write this letter for you .
I worked at a local cinema last summer .
I would like to tell you about this experience and how much I enjoyed working in there .
As you know , my hobby is going to the movies , so you can image how happy I was when I got this job .
I was responsible for selling the movie tickets and having a good time .
I would like to have this job and I think I would be suitable for it .
I have all the needed traits for this job : knowledge of cooking , politeness and diligence at work .
In addition , I want to say that I always try to do all my duties with responsibility .
Once upon a time , a young boy called Michael was walking beside a beautiful lake .
When he looked into the water , he found a little ill frog .
After that , Michael decided to bring it home because the frog was very ill .
The frog got well while it was at home for two months .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake because he lost his house .
It was a hot , sunny day . Peter decided to go to the waterfront promenade and have a walk .
Suddenly , he heard a hihg - pitched scream .
Then he saw a woman starting to jump over the enclosure !
Peter thought that he must do something quickly to prevent her from committing suicide .
He shouted out for help , but no one was around .
So he immediately contacted the police for help .
In the flash of an eye , the police came .
Finally , the life of the woman was saved by the police and the police thanked Peter for helping them .
The person I most admire is called Ronaldinho , a football player who , in my opinion , is the best of all time .
He won only one golden ball , but he should have won more than that .
He mostly played in the number 10 even though he also played in numbers 80 and 45 .
He was born in Porto Alegre , in 1980 , and played in several teams , like Barcelona and AC Milan .
The skills he has are wonderful . He knows everything about football , his passes were fantastic , he passed the ball even with his back !
Even though most people think that Messi or Ronaldo Nazario are even better than him , other people think the same as me .
The kitchen looks small and simple .
The living room shares an area with the dining room .
t all started when I found a book on the bus .
This book got me interested and I began reading more and more . The more I read , the more I loved it . At this time nothing mattered to me . I wanted to finish the book as soon as possible . I do not know the end , but I wanted the end of the book to be amazing , but at the same time , I did not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in .
In the end , a lady interrupted me and I was angry about the situation .
That was the reason I did not finish the book .
Nowadays our world is fighting every day against different problems . One day there is the problem of violence , one day the atmospheric conditions , or many other problems .
Today we can try to imagine how our lives might change in the next 50 years , if they will be better or worse .
In my opinion , everyone 's life will see a great improvement , from the economic point of view , but also from the social and cultural one .
It is known that in the future there will come a day when any kind of unrenewable resource will run out .
But I imagine that in the next years we can begin to spread the use of alternative resources , such as electricity generated by the light of the sun 's rays .
Or in addition , we could use the energy generated by the environment , such as the wind or inorganic waste .
Maybe there will also be great new discoveries in medicine that will make all kinds of disease disappear .
To sum up , I think that we should expect a great future in which man will regain possession of his whole capability and , thanks to that , he will change everyone 's lives for the better .
Today I was at the university learning new things .
Cristina really likes dogs and she is very pretty .
Fernando is a young man , he likes to listen to English music .
Jose is not at my university but we are good friends .
Pedro is a good friend , he loves to read books and he works with your mother .
Ivan is from Machachi . He is not studying anything but I am sure that he is a great person .
When I was a child I wanted to be a doctor .
Two years ago , I won a nice cap .
There are 6 people in my house .
I grew up in Machachi .
Last month I went to Machalilla National Park with my friends .
Los Frailes is in Machalilla National Park . It is a wonderful beach , the sand is very white .
I 'm interested in one sport ; football .
Because it 's the most common sport in the world as well as because I 'm good at football , I play football with my friends every weekend and always play on Tuesday evening .
Also , it 's good for fitness and health .
I 'd like to give you some advice about how to start playing this sport .
I think it 's a good idea if you buy some equipment for football and practise with your friends before matches at home or in the playground for two or three days .
Next , you can play with anyone with confidence and control .
Moreover , sometimes why do n't you run in the morning ?
In my opinion , it 's useful for playing football .
I understand what you mean , because cars are so convenient , as you said .
You do n't need to worry about timetables .
Also , during your journey , you might be able to stay overnight in your own car .
But nowadays , cars are one of the reasons causing global warming and air pollution .
Car companies try to spread electric cars , but it seems to take a long time .
And some people have already switched to using public transport like trains or buses .
Moreover , it 's still popular to travel for long journeys on trains or ships because the scenery you can see from them is totally different from that from cars .
For these reasons , I do n't think there is no future for public transport .
" Annabelle " is a horror movie which I am going to watch this Saturday .
I am wondering if I will be scared after the movie .
The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was kept in a museum in Conecticut where she is visited by a priest who blesses her twice a month .
John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife : a beautiful doll dressed in a wedding dress .
Unfortunatelly , in a horrible night , the couple 's house is invaded by a Satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them .
The Satanists invoked an evil entity that is capable of the worst things ... Annabelle .
After Mia gives birth to her daughter Lilly , Annabelel wants to kill her .
Even the priest doesn ' t know how to help the unhappy familly .
Everyone is terrified and finds out that a demon is attached to the doll .
Idon't know the end of the story , but I do n't think that it is a happy one ...
The aim of this report is to highlight how the citizens take care of the environment , in order to give suggestions to keep this area clean .
In the matter of that , information concerning what people do , or could do , is going to be shown .
Few people who live in suburban areas have the following routine :
2 Divide wet rubbish from products which can not be recycled .
3 Denounce those who leaves rubbish in the wrong places .
If the majority of citizens , including the ones who live in the city centre , followed these ideas , this city would definitely be cleaner .
Unfortunately , deeper problems are linked to the difficulty that all the inhabitants have respecting those principles .
Some think that volunteers should involve careless people in many projects to keep their city attractive and marvelous .
It is proven that being part of a project always makes people feel useful .
Nowadays , we can see that , increasingly , public transport needs to improve the quality of its services . People need this kind of transport daily to go to work , go to school and in general depend so much on public transport .
The government can improve public transport by making a great investment like changing the old vehicles for new and increasing the number of buses , trains and building more bus stops and trains stations . This kind of action will help a lot to improve the quality of public transport for the population and will make the life of the people easier .
Today , many people prefer to travel by car than public transport because of the bad quality of services , and because the bus and the trains are full and many times are also dirty and late .
However , if this situation does not change and if our government do not take providence about this important issue , it will be the end of transport public and it will be more convenient to use a car .
I am writing this letter because we need to improve the school gym .
The gym has many problems that we are going to describe :
The first problem is that we do n't have enough apparatus for all of the students .
The second problem is about that some apparatus are not working well because the school hasn't done maintenance a since long time ago .
For the first problem , in my opinion , the school should buy some other apparatus , because there are not enough for all of the students ,
For the second problem , the solution , for me , is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the school 's machines .
I hope my proposal will be useful to you .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
I work as freelancer journalist , prepare reports dealing with the whole situation in the city of Jerusalem , and publish my reports on many of the websites .
I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for the newspaper supplement " The Voice of Women " which is published by the WATC ; the " Women 's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have a collaboration with Environment and Development , a magazine which is published by the Center for development work " Maan " , and other websites and news and media organizations .
The world is sadly lacking in an environmental mind . As a consequence , it caused global warming , which is the most important global problem . It does n't matter to more than three quarters of the world 's population .
Currently , we have got more than six different types of banks on our streets , but as far as I know , it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the environment because , nowadays , we produce a lot of different materials , all of them overproduced and we only learn about this in our home , in our childhood . Accordingly , I am one of the few teenagers in the world worried about it , so I really do help the environment as far as I can .
First of all , at home we recycle plastic , glass , paper and cartons , oils , clothes , batteries , putting organic matter in a special composting bank so that we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials , and , finally , all the other things are sent to a special tip so that we avoid dropping them anywhere . Then , when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street putting their scraps in the wrong bank , I explain to them how they have to recycle and how important it is for our environment that we carefully recycle .
A couple of years ago , I could hardly see any bins in supermarkets and houses .
Nowadays , I see bins everywhere and even a small child of 3 being taught to put unwanted materials in the bin .
It is truly an amazing experience and how much progress my small village has made in 2 years .
However , separate bins for different categories of rubbish are not provided .
So , we can easily see people throwing everything in the same bin .
In spite of throwing rubbish in a bin , we also do some harm to the environment unknowingly .
As there are different kinds of materials , rubbish , some are recyclable and some are not .
In my opinion , in the next 50 years , the population will increase and there wo n't be resources enough for everybody .
There will be on other planets , for example the moon , many citadels inside enormous domes .
Then , I suppose that in every country much more renewable energy will be used instead of nuclear energy to ensure a secure future for the next generations , and maybe everybody will use electric cars to reduce the atmospheric pollution .
People 's lives will be changed even by policy and the economy .
I hope that in the future there will not be any wars caused by the economic crisis .
I think that public transport has a future . Indeed , travelling in a car is much more comfortable , because you do n't have to walk to take a bus or the underground .
But there 's a thing . No one has enough money to buy a car or maybe two . That 's why there are a lot of people who prefer public transport .
Perhaps in the future public transport could be more comfortable for the rest of the people who do n't have a car .
I think that there is n't a future for public transport because , nowadays , people usually use their own private car .
This has some advantages , such as it being more comfortable and faster .
When you travel by bus , you must have a timetable and it is less comfortable than travelling by car .
Sometimes , private transport is cheaper if you go with other people .
For example , when you go by car you can go with other people , so you pay less money for petrol .
On the other hand , private transport is damaging for the planet and we must take care of the planet . We can help to prevent the pollution of the environment if we take public transport , which does n't pollute .
At the moment , there is more than one car per person . That is a problem for me because people do n't take care the of environment .
They prefer to be comfortable .
In conclusion , using public transport causes less damage to the environment and most people prefer .
I want to describe a famous actor from my country . He is Sergey Bezrukov .
He performs in many interesting movies and operas .
Some of them I saw when I was a young girl .
He has very important skills for an actor . These are charisma and charm .
What is more , he is a good husband and a good father to his children .
I think he deserves to be famous because he is a very talented person .
Now he has founded his own company .
I am planning to visit his company .
One of his interesting films is about a musician , and it was popular between 1980 and 2000 .
Its title is " Visockiy " .
Life is unpredictable and unforeseen .
The immense possibilities of life give us the opportunity to explore life but sometimes it leads to threats and dangers to our life .
We surely pray for the best life of our near and dear ones .
But insurance is also a necessity and indispensable for peace of mind . It gives us surety to live life securely .
It is not only to save our life but also secure assets like houses , cars etc .
The insurance for non - accidental death is known as general insurance and for life is known as life insurance .
But we still sell it not buy it .
A number of countries give attention and provide secure life for their citizens , but our country is still under - insured .
The government should play a key role by providing trustworthy organizations , surveyors , loss assessors etc .
To inform people by running awareness campaigns .
To provide insurance at nominal prices , and making claims should be easy . Give surety so that people can accept and trust the insurance companies .
The can play an important role in it .
It gives competition to national companies . By virtue of which they work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders . People can always buy a nominal premium we should inform them about the types of insurance as well as the benefits of insurance .
I love soccer because when I was child my brothers took me with them to the club and I enjoyed it when I watched them .
First , soccer is a very famous game in the world and a lot of people like to play soccer and I try to play like them .
For example , I can watch a lot of matches a day and I enjoy it when I watch famous players such as Cristiano Ronaldo for Real Madrid and Messy for Barcelona .
Second , soccer is a very interesting game , because when I play soccer I feel very happy .
Moreover , soccer helps the human body to be very healthy , because when someone plays soccer , his body becomes strong .
Finally , I like playing soccer because , like me , most of my friends play soccer a lot every day and that makes me love it so much .
I would like to say to anyone who wants to play soccer to be very careful when he plays it , because it can cause a lot of injuries . But at the same time , it is a very nice game .
I read your e - mail , so let 's talk about books ! I usually read a book in my free time , because I prefer stories to short articles .
Recently , I read four great books about Shoah . They were very interesting . My favourite was : " The Book Thief " . I read it for school , but I had already seen the film of this book .
It 's a very moving book , but it is n't difficult . I think it 's for teenagers , but it is also good for adults .
I love the fact that in this book there are a lot of German words , so I could also improve my German ( I go to a languages high school ) .
Last Friday I visited Balla without any planning .
I usually wake up at 10 am , but on that day my father called me at 8:00 am and asked me to go to Balla with them .
He usually avoids me in this kind of situation .
Nowadays , he treats me as botheration .
The reason he asked me to go to Balla was because Noman would feel lonely there as Badhon and her mother were not going .
I was hesitant but later decided to go .
Actually , I did n't have enough courage to say no to my father .
We had been told earlier that Abul kaka had got a very nice PAJERO Jeep from the office . Nonetheless , the performance of the vehicle was awful that day .
It stalled in the road several times while we were on the way there .
So I was feeling very anxious in case the car broke down on Aricha highway .
Because I was so sure Abul kaka and Noman would prefer Aricha highway rather than the Singair road .
I do n't feel comfortable on highways for many reasons .
Those are the most dangerous roads in the country . If there is an alternate way , I always use that .
That 's why when I go to the village I like to use the Singair Road rather than the DHAKA - ARICHA highway .
When I was a youngster , my father and I rode a motorcycle to visit our place using this road .
As I was a kid I fell asleep sometimes .
Maybe it 's because of that I have a high regard for the road .
Noman took the front seat .
Though he was unwilling to sit there because Abul kaka or my father should be seated there .
When the car stopped to get oil at a service station near Gilando , my father asked me to go onto the very back seats of the jeep .
I thought I should n't go because those benches were disgraceful for me .
I felt like I was being deprived by my family .
If I were in a better position , it could not happen to me .
People humiliate me in many ways because I do n't earn any money .
I find it very painful when my parents do it to me .
I keep a cool head and try to overcome the situation by thinking one day I will prove myself . I know who I am and what I 'm doing .
My thoughts are unquestionably better than others ' .
Hence , I 'm waiting for a good time .
We reached our home at 1:00 pm and planned to return to Dhaka at 4:00 pm .
It gave the impression that only going and coming back in a big car was the main purpose of the trip .
That day I spent most of my time with Noman with his over - talking habit .
We visited Nagar chak with much anticipation .
In this season I like to see the sun shine .
The crystal clear and mild sun is a great favorite of mine .
While I was listening to Noman , I was discerning that I should question more .
When he talks he makes many mistakes because of his over - talking habit .
At 4:00 pm we set off for Dhaka was an early move because of the faulty car .
I fell asleep as soon as we crossed Jhitka bazar and when I woke up , we had crossed Tora Bridge .
We stopped our car at a roadside tea stall to take tea .
Then we set off for Dhaka .
When we talked to our seniors , I think I had to control myself though they talked about unreal things .
They prefer industrialization to nature .
At the same time , they also keep saying that nature was more green and vigorous in their time .
A neverending argument took place and thus we reached Dhaka .
Travelling or moving from one place to another by car is much more convenient than public transport .
By car , you can go wherever you want on time , with no need to wait for hours at the stations for a bus or subway train .
For example , if you are in a hurry and want to reach the place you are heading to , you can drive as fast as possible .
You can have some other choices , for example , you can stop to buy something : water , juice or a snack if you get hungry during your journey or thirsty .
You can even take a rest for a while to sleep or to have a nap .
You wo n't suffer anymore from the trouble or annoying stuff on bus most of the time , like no room for you to sit , bad smells people can make , or getting bothering or bushing .
It 's convenient .
But , on the other hand , because , recently , the traffic has been terrifically unbearable : so many cars ; very noisy ; unclean air produced , public transport has become better for saving the planet .
All over the world , people always need advice to keep looking after their environments . First , the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students with tips that should help us to make our environment clean . Second , they should run awareness campaigns about the environment ; for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste paper baskets , which helps workers to recycle it easily . Finally , to stay healthy , we need a healthy environment .
But in the region where I live I had not found one .
suddenly , a krav maga class started in a gym close to my house .
I did not think twice .
I went there and signed up .
It is good self defence ... it is object , simple and fast .
Krav maga teaches us how to handle ourselves in difficult situations .
If it was not true , life would be so much better .
The most exciting day of my life was when my sister and I discovered that we would spend one week on a cruise with our friends ! That was a very beautiful holiday !
We spent a lot of time together every day ; we visited some fantastic cities in Greece , like Santorini , Athens and many others .
In Italy we also visited Bari and Venice , too .
Every day we spent time on the beach and in the sea .
Every evening we went to the restaurant on the cruiser .
The meals were very good and in the morning I ate English breakfast or eggs and bread because I wanted to change my routine while I was on the cruise .
I think it was the most exciting holiday I 've ever had and my favourite too .
My classmates and I along with our teachers and other classes went to the cinema to see the film " Fantastic Boccaccio " .
It was an interesting experience to go to the cinema for my class and see a film about what I had studied in the Italian lesson and understand better the stories of Boccaccio , one of the most important Italian writers .
Watching the film , we had the possibility to see the characteristics of Boccaccio 's main characters and the different places where the stories took place .
In my opinion , the film was very well made : the registers of the film ( there are two ) tell us five novels with only one main protagonist : love in every situation .
The registers of the film said that they wanted to create a film without time , and they were able to do this .
The scenery in the film , the costumes and the music are very beautiful and I recommend this film to all of my friends .
In the past century , we have seen lots of changes in the world .
It 's obvious that life nowadays is really different from 50 years ago , so we can predict that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
When it comes to change , we can think of what in our lives is still inconvenient and could probably change .
Most of the work will probably be done by machines . People who lack academic qualifications might find it very hard to get a job . Knowledge might be in demand if people live in the future .
There are some issues that make me worried . The environment is getting worse . We have to come up with methods to solve this and save our Earth .
The relationships between countries are also significant , as we can see discord between countries , hoping that it will not lead to war .
Television entertains as well as educates people .
These days , people are educating themselves by watching the television .
Televison not only provides entertainment , it will also give lots of information about the events around the globe .
Channels like National Geographic and Animal Planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origins of species .
Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people .
When Michael woke up that morning he smelled a strange smell in the air . He did not know what what the source of that strange smell was but , in his nose , he received a kind of sign something bad had happened .
Very quickly he got up and tried to put that sensation out of his head , but ... the smell , the feelings , the sign ... but " what ?
what is that ? " he thought .
He started to watch the kids running , playing , laughing a lot , the same couple from yesterday talking about love , the sadness in the city .
With a great effort , he sat down on the grass , he felt tired , and had a slight sensation of pain in his chest , sitting there with many sounds in the air , he started to recall ... his face changed is dark , now he had a clear image of eveerything . When he opened the door of the house , his girlfriend was there dying on the floor . Michael remembered everything : the fight , the lies , the screams , the knife ... the blood ; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Diabetes is an increase of glucose in the blood , There are two types , first Diabetes Type 1 which is present in children , the patient needs insulin every day . Also , this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insulin released by the person 's immune system .
Diabetes Type 2 is present in adults ; the insulin is generated but it does not work in the body , so the amounts of glucose are stored in the body .
This diabetes is caused by bad diet of people or because people have a bad life .
So it is necessary to eat vegetables and fruit and also to do exercise .
My view is that public transport is good because it has prevented pollution , which is good for the public .
Many people think travelling by car is more comfortable for them .
If they planned to travel by public transport , people would walk to the bus stop and get off the bus and walk for necessary thing .
So my opinion is good for both parties .
Hope this message finds you in good health

I was waiting for your email .
This week , I went to the country . It was great fun because we went to the cinema and we ate in a lot of different restaurants .
Bye , I have to go .
I am writing to sponsorize my favourite sport , the most beautiful sport in the world ;
Basketball is a complete sport ; aerobic and anaerobic .
It 's a team sport . The team is made of 5 people and you need a ball and a hoop .
Some people say that basketball is only for tall guys ,
but it is n't true . In the A league in Italy , we have various players who are not very tall ,
like 1 meter 60 . So if you love this game you can play it no matter what .
Just find a ball and a hoop and play it .
If you want to start this sport , find a friend that can teach you the basic movements and how to pass and shoot ,
then practice does the rest .
If you train and you have willpower , nothing can stop you .
Nowadays , basketball is spreading around the world .
I hope that the number of players will increase and increase every day .
So let 's play basketball .
At the moment he is doing three A levels at Camden College .
At the weekend he usually plays football or basketball and this year he is learning how to rock climb .
School is finishing in two weeks and next summer he wants to climb in Scotland .
I had the best friend when I was a student at high school .
We studied hard together to prepare for the university exam , shared our problems and almost things has relatived with us .
It was a great time for me .
He seemed like my boyfriend .
The first year of university , I revealed my love to him .
I had a love affair .
I did n't call , send messages or meet him .
Although I did well for a long time , one day , he contacted me again , so I did n't ignore him .
He said that he wanted to be best friends as before .
But now , what can I do ? I still love him . My love has become even stronger .
What should I do ?
Should I show him my love again ?
Last week , from September 11 to September 21 , we had a mini - vacation .
From September 11 to September 14 , I did nothing besides watch TV , take care of my little sister Ellie and chat with my friends .
During the rest of that boring week , I did a 1000-piece puzzle .
On Sunday , my family and I went to Causeway Amador , then to Albrook Mall .
After the exams finished , I went home and had nothing to do , so I thought that I needed to watch my dramas because it was a week since I had watched them due to the exam week .
From September 12 to September 14 , I was too lazy because I was tired from the exam , so I spent all day lying on the sofa doing nothing apart from watching the TV and chatting with my friends .
Besides , I needed to take care of my little sister Ellie , who is very cute and funny and , right now , she is always trying to get up and stand and walk .
On the rest of the boring week , I was watching TV , and suddenly , my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet , so I decided to do my Paris puzzle with my sister , which had been less than half done for about one year , but it had too much color in the sky , so I did n't finished it a year ago .
We began to do it again and it took us the whole week to finish it .
While doing the puzzle , I decided to count how many pieces were left . After counting them , I realized that five pieces were missing .
I was so angry , because I was finishing the puzzle and five pieces were missing . So I began to search the whole house for the five pieces but did n't find them .
On Saturday , I finished my puzzle but with five pieces missing . But I was happy too .
Also , my uncle , aunt , grandfather and cousins went with us .
After arriving at the Causeway , my brother and my cousins went to ride bicycles for one hour .
I was hoping that my father could teach me to drive the car , but it was not possible because we went to Albrook Mall to eat and my father did n't want to return to Causeway Amador to teach me to drive .
Mini vacations can be fun , but sometimes boring , because you haven't planned anything for the vacation .
The best thing I did was to solve my beautiful Paris puzzle and go to Amador with my family and have a good time with them .
Mini vacations are a break for us to have fun and good times with our adorable and lovely family and friends .
When I was a child , I usually wore blue , grey and red .
My bedroom is blue and orange , the colours of my toys when I was a child were different .
I always choose my clothes because only I know my favourite clothes and , when I was a child , my toys .
Now I wear different colours . For example , black , blue , grey and others .
Maybe they will change .
I 'm sure you 'll agree that Pompei is the most important archeological site in the world .
It was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 75 BC .
Vesuvius - this is the volcano 's name - covered it with a lot of ash so that walls , houses , food , clothes , bodies of citizens were preserved as they were .
You can walk through the same streets and enter the same shops the Romans entered some centuries ago !
Is n't it incredible ?
In addition , it is possible to book special tours in which there are guides dressed like pompei 's citizens .
There is a unique atmosphere !
In my opinion , no one should come to Italy without visiting Pompei .
In particular , in urban areas , for example , Taipei city in Taiwan .
People who live there know the convenient public transport system called MRT ; it 's fast , cheaper and you do n't have to find a parking space .
Besides , it 's harmful and makes the earth 's environment worse because of the emission of so much carbon dioxide .
That will cause global warming .
But , if you live in the country , a car may be essential , because it will cost so much money to buy the tickets if the family is large .
So , I think the government should have to draw up a proposal to solve the problems between the use for urban areas and countryside .
And think deeply about the problem of protecting the environment .
I love my little family .
If any problems arise , i I go to my parents and tell them the problem , and they solve the problem .
My parents are good guides .
There are my role models . Sometimes we go to the tour programs , it programs . Those are very happy moments .
My mammy tells me a story at night .
Mom makes the special foods for festivals .
My family is a nuclear family .
Steve Ramsay works for the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D and lives in Washington D.C. after the Battle of New York .
One day , a S.H.I.E.L.D agent was attacked by a ghost .
After that , Steve becomes an America captain to protect the world again .
He meets a strong opponent who is a winter soldier when he wants to find the wirepuller .
Besides being excellent exercise , it is also the most comfortable , because it allows me to concentrate , to be with myself , talking and praying to God with each step in the morning .
I wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning .
I consider this to be the best time to do sport , taking into account that the pollution is down at that time .
There is not so much traffic , and my senses and lungs perceive and breathe all the smells of the flowers , and the land . First , I walk slowly , and then I begin to walk as fast as possible to improve my fitness and I end up walking 5 turns around the park .
What I really enjoy is lying on the grass .
It is during this moment that I get to talk to God .
I feel that he is near to me , that he listens to every word that I pray .
Doing so , I begin my daily routine , I come back home , have my breakfast , followed by lunch , because I have to get to work at 9 o'clock .
It is an activity that goes according to the capacity of each person , and doing it each morning improves our health and takes away all the bad from our body .
The graph below gives information about seasonal sales of ice - cream in different places : in an ice - cream van and an indoor swimming pool from Jan to Dec .
Overall , an average of 5000 dollars per year about ice cream van .
In addition , indoor swimming pool sales have a slightly decline from 2012 to 2014 .
First , the graph showed an upward trend for the ice cream van and , in 2014,it had the largest percentage of sales at nearly 5500 dollars from Jul - Sep .
No matter what year , its lowest level was always in Jan - Mar .
Maybe because in this period of time the weather was cold , the number of purchasers is greatly reduced .
We can see from the diagram , the highest peak in the graph has increased year by year , as the low as .
Second , for the indoor swimming pool , it generally appears to be wavy falling , from 2500 dollars in 2012 to 2000 dollars in 2014 . We can infer , it will not rise sharply , and it is impossible for it to fall sharply .
Most people like to have their own car , because they think it is more comfortable and flexible .
You can go out of your house and take your car and leave for your job and park very close .
But I think that public transport is the future . We need to preserve the environment , this is an imperative for our world , and the solution is to take the point that the governments invest more in public transport , so people do n't need to get a car to be able to have a job and do n't need it for the normal development of their lives .
Also , we have to promote people getting jobs close to their accommodation or getting accommodation close to their jobs , because we have too much pollution . And we could reward companies that hire staff close to the place of work , maybe in a radius of 4 kilometres , and we could reward people that change their accommodation to live near to their job or for going there by bicycle .
Maybe this sounds a bit crazy , but any solution will be good , we must only make our minds up to be able to look across .
What fine weather today !
It 's April now , and spring is finally here .
The sun shines brightly , the snow melted in the March .
Birds have returned from warm countries .
They sing joyfully and build their nests .
They feel tired after a long snowy winter .
In March , we set forward our watches an hour .
Summertime was first converted in 1900 .
The days are getting longer but nights are getting shorter and lighter .
We put our watches back an hour in October .
It pleases some people because they will be able to sleep an hour more .
I like spring and always wait for it and wait for the summer holidays with impatience .
As soon as I have sat all my exams , I will travel .
As they say in the English proverb " travel broadens the mind " . In summer you can switch off from your daily routine , relax , have a talk with friends .
I haven't decided as yet where I will spend the summer .
It has become a big problem now .
However , I am stopped by recent tragic developments in foreign countries .
I think it 's better and safer to go to the Black Sea , to Crimea or to Kuakas .
My friends have bought tickets to Sochi already .
It 's possible I will join them , because I have never been to Sochi and everyone should visit this wonderful city once in their life .
Well , I do martial arts .
They 're more for self - defense , but what I do , and my way to stay healthy , is martial arts and running .
I suppose I would have to say that , in Japan , Sumo is my favorite sport for watching .
I would probably have to be three times as big as I am to even begin to qualify for something like that but , yeah , I enjoy watching it a lot .
I have to start saying that I never imagined swimming as my favorite sport , because until my back injury , I did other sports . I mostly like extreme sports like downhill skiing , skateboarding , martial arts like Aikido , jiujitsu or ninjutsu , but because of my injury I had to start swimming and now I love it .
The reason why I enjoy this sport is because I feel free when I am in the water , it is so relaxing and I have read it is the most complete sport because you work the whole body .
If you want to start swimming , I think you should look for a swimming teacher because if ca n't swim , you need one , and if you can swim but not well , if you are not in practice and know your swimming style is not the best , I recommend professional assistance .
More time that you do n't have that assistance , it is going to be more difficult to improve your style and enjoy swimming more , because if you really know how to swim you will have more resistance in the water .
She works at a language school at the local university .
I think that may be the reason she had Sleep Paralysis last night .
In Korea , we call it ' Ka - Wee - Nool - Rim ' , which means being pressed by a ' Ka - wee ' , or ghost .
Yes , she actually felt as if someone was pressing down on her chest with their hand .
She was not even able to lift a single finger tip , as if she had been turned into a stone statue .
Then , she realized that four indistinct strangers were staring at her , standing just beside the bed .
She was so scared .
She tried screaming and calling me as I was sleeping peacefully beside her .
She could n't open her mouth to say anything at all .
Even worse , two of them started whispering in her ears , die ‚Ä¶ die .. .
I was watching a YouTube clip on my iPad .
She reproached me for not waking her up despite the fact that she had been calling me so eagerly .
It was just a dream , but very real .
They think they really opened their eyes and woke up since it is so vivid and detailed .
Often they explain and describe the scene in detail like a cup on the table , friends who are watching TV beside them , a room light and so on .
But nothing is real . They realize that no cup is on the table , no one is in the room , and the light is off .
Commonly , the dreamers say that they :
- experience it when they are very tired physically and very stressed .
- feel drowning down when they are about to fall asleep ( so they know it will happen ) .
- feel a lot of pressure on their body and can not move in the dream .
- see someone or some people standing beside or riding on them .
Some experience this very easily and often .
The most scary case I heard is that the ghost pulled her under the bed while stabbing her chest with a sharp gimlet .
Hi ! My name is C√°tia and I am a student of electrical engineering .
I am in the third year at university , I do n't know what the Master 's will be that I am going to do , but I want a Master 's related to programming .
I have many difficulties with programming , but I think that if I work hard I can overcome my difficulties .
In the last few days , I and my group did some experiments for our project .
Next week we are going to prepare some equipment to solve this problem .
I want to write a review of my book about Nigeria and read another book about robots and their mechanisms .
I am going to try to read these books to improve my English , because in the future I intend to take the first certificate .
This is very important for me because when I work for a company I will need a certificate ! ! !
How are you ? I have just received your letter .
I think that you can to come to my country if you want , because I will help you .
In the first place , I think that you must look on the internet . You will see different cities of this country and you can choose the best .
In my opinion , you must go to Madrid or Barcelona because they are the most attractive .
Barcelona is big and there is a lot of industry , so there are a lot of jobs .
Also , Madrid is a nice city . You can to find everything that you need .
In Madrid there are some jobs , too , and you will be near me .
Spanish food is fantastic , there are a lot of restaurants for you to eat at and I think that the food is more expensive than in your country .
If you do n't like Spanish food , you can go to a restaurant with food from another country , but I know you love it .
On the other hand , people are friendly , as you know , because you know some Spanish people .
You must come , because I think that you would love my country and I can always help you .
I hope you come here .
He picked up the keys and quickly left the house .
As he was going down the stairs from the fourth floor , his neighbour Mary stopped him .
He needed to arrive at the train station on time .
The widow woman , who was very nice , gave a present to Peter .
The young Polish man was very grateful and replied to the woman : " Thank you , it hasn't to make any present "
Mary smiled to Peter and said : " You are welcome . Now , you have to enjoy your family .
It was a pity for Peter to leave Bath , but he had to go back to his country .
I 'm so glad you are coming to my country . I 'll give you some suggestions , hoping that you can have a wonderful summer vacation !
It not only offers a high salary , but also , the employees there are kind .
You should be able to have a great experience .
When it comes to travelling , you must not miss the night markets .
There , you can have a taste of cuisine from all around the world , which will make you freshen up .
Moreover , once you have a bite on a sausage , you will fall in love with it .
I will help you as much as I can .
Hope you will have a good time .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He had forgotten to go to his English classes .
It was half past seven and his class had begun fifteen minutes ago .
Last week , his mother told him that he had to go to his classes if he wanted to hang out with his friends .
He already knew that he was late , but he could not go now , so he decided to deceive his mother .
But he did not realise something . His little brother was watching him through the window .
When his mother came back from work , her little son told her what his brother had done .
She was very angry and she could not believe that her son had done that .
After that , Peter did not hang out for three months , so he could learn his lesson . You must not lie to or deceive your mother .
I think that public transport is always going to be very important in our life , because not all people have the possibility to buy a car , and because public transport is less expensive than a car . So for that reason , public transport in the future could exist , because public transport is a necessity all over the world , not only because of money , but also for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport .
I went to the nature section , which is interesting as it is about natural aspects on earth like the elements , rocks and periods of life related to organisms .
The section was big and it presented a lot of information in a scientific manner , some sections had complete information while others had not .
Beginning with one of the complete parts that I preferred and liked I 'm going to write about the Ice Age .
It was a period of time in earth 's history when temperatures fell globally , causing ice sheets and glaciers to form far from the north and south poles .
What did you learn about debates ?
Teach us about debates .
How to be good debaters .
He uses a rule for debates : proposition + result = positive or negative ( Why ? )
A hot spot is a place where the debaters can explain the idea .
The hot spot helps to get more confidence .
Always in front of your audience .
The result depends on : confidence , volume of the voice , body posture and audience .
The main idea is to keep the body , take the mind .
Great debaters have to believe in their idea .
The idea does n't matter , only the arguments .
I do n't know is n't an answer .
An important deal , is never to quit .
A debate is combat .
Peter had just got out of school and he realized that he was late for his weekly guitar lesson .
But before the lesson , he had to have lunch with his family and take the dog to the vet 's for his annual vaccine .
Peter had a quick lunch in ten minutes , spent another two minutes finding the bike and putting the dog in the basket ; at the vet 's surgery , three people were waiting , so Peter was forced to wait .
After an hour , the dog was vaccinated and taken home , but his mother needed a bottle of milk .
Unfortunately , Anne , his sister , had just taken the bike , so he was forced to walk to the nearest supermarket .
Peter 's mother needed a special kind of milk without lactose , and the market near home did n't have it .
So Peter had to make a choice : going to the lesson or waiting for his father to get home to get the milk with the car ?
After an exhausting afternoon , Peter had a bit of luck . In fact , his father , Jack , had just come back from work , so he could go to get the milk and giving him a lift .
With a little delay , Peter made it !
First , I want to introduce myself .
I am a young woman with a melancholy character .
I have many problems with my speaking skills .
If I am in public and want to give a presentation , I always get nervous .
I do n't know why , it 's always happened to me .
Sometimes , I feel so stupid because I really ca n't speak in front of the public .
Second ,
I love writing but I am not confident about my grammar .
I make many mistakes in every story I write . I use the wrong tense .
I call this mistake " Du " .
Why " du " ? Yeah ...
because I love using this word .
I have no idea after this sentence .
As the population grows , you will see an increasing problem .
Therefore , public transportation is the future and more and more people will be using the metro , public buses etc .
They cause pollution .
Sport is an activity that helps people be in an optimal physical condition .
My favourite sport is football . It is a complete sport ; there are aggression , mentality and fun .
My favourite football club is Napoli . It is the heart club . For this team , I feel indescribable emotions ... when I see my team , I smile in moments of joy , I cry in moments of sadness and suffering and rejoice when they score and win the game .
I advise all people that want to start this sport to begin , because this sport helps to grow and mature .
Working in your own company is very challenging because you deal with a lot of areas , manage all departments and learn about business , management , economics , sales , engineering , technical support and other skills .
You are responsible for your workers and customer satisfaction . However , it is very satisfying to see how your own company is growing and your customers returning because they loved your work .
That work looks depressing , demanding and stressful , but it is very rewarding and if you like the challenges you will never be bored .
hope you are fine . Please know that I miss you so much and I hope to see you soon .
I 'm very happy to know that you want to come to Egypt and work here .
Here are some tips about the Egyptian people .
They are so kind , friendly , and stressed because they have a lot of problems nowadays . The level of poverty , the standard of living , the fixed cost is increasing dramatically and the purchasing power is decreasing .
The salary or the income in Egypt does not match this increase or this inflation .
So , if you want to work in Egypt , you must have complete information about the job ( location , salary , incentives , allowances , work environment , position title , company type , policy , mission , vision )
With best wishes
Military service is when people are forced by the government to be a part of the army to serve and protect the country .
There are many countries where people have to do military service when they reach 18 , such as Taiwan , South Korea and Singapore .
The duration of military service should be from around 12 months to 20 months .
Also , there are different types of training during military service . People generally do a lot of training in obedience or how to use weapons .
Thus , there is a source of agreement and another source of disagreement , which is freedom of choice and mental maturity .
As this topic , one of the reasons why everyone should not have to complete military service is because of freedom of choice .
Some people may think it is a human right that we let people choose if they want to join the military .
Otherwise , when people are forced by the government , they probably feel the freedom of choice is restricted .
So some counties do not force people to join the military .
In contrast , it could be a benefit that improves their mental maturity .
If people do military service when they are just 18 , they may learn a lot of life skills as there are quite a high claim in the military and the chancellor who works in the military may request the soldiers that everything frequently be regular .
For instance , they usually need them to fold up a quilt at a specified angle or there is a specific time that you must wake up and go to sleep .
People should not complain about anything even if they seem to be right .
But after a period of time , people could develop their obedience , especially young people ; they are likely to become more independent people .
To conclude , there are reasons to effect by people should or should not have to do military service .
However , the effects may be different , depending on the duration .
Hi Mum and Dad
The museum and the art gallery are located in the capital city .
I really like antiques , even though there is not much to look at .
They have some paintings by Leonardo da Vinci which really impress me .
My favourite part was listening to a guide introduce us to painting .
I ca n't wait to get back home and tell you more about the trip .
In my city , we do n't have a regular policy of care for the environment .
There have been many projects to improve the care for the environment .
But there is a big problem : the people 's attitudes .
In my country , you can make a lot of effort to take care of the environment , but the bad attitude of our people is a big problem .
That is because we do n't take interest in the problems of others .
We think that our authorities are responsible for these matters .
So , we do n't take positive actions , individually .
People put their rubbish in bags and throw them away near their houses .
They do n't spend money on a good container .
Then , dogs can break open the bags and eat the rubbish .
Consequently , the streets are always dirty .
Personally , I prefer to have a clean street .
It does n't matter if I lose time putting the bags of rubbish in a good container .
If everyone demonstrated a better attitude , it would be possible to improve our environment .
Nowadays , we grow up with the possibility of choosing a lot of sports .
This fact allows young people to do exercise and enjoy themselves at the same time .
Team sports also help to meet other people and make new friends .
The favorite sport of many people is football , whereas my favorite is basketball .
I started to play it when I was twelve years old and these days I still love this sport .
My main reason for loving it is how you feel when you play a match and , in the end , your team win .
Also , I have met great friends who play basketball .
Every sport focuses on some parts of the body , but basketball is the most complete sport .
It is true that basketball requires a lot of physical activity , but a good mental attitude is very important .
You ca n't be disappointed because you do n't get a point or have a bad day , because the other players can sympathise with you .
If it happens , you must continue doing the best you can .
To achieve this , I recommend doing exercise three times a week and following a healthy diet .
Adolescence has always been the hardest part in anybody 's whole life .
Turning , in a fleeting glimpse , into an adult , perceiving the other side of life , how tough and complicated it is , trying to deal with its different circumstances .
At this point , you merely have a brief look at your whole life , many questions spinning in your head , accusing yourself of being a lost cause , wishing you could turn the clock back , but it 's all no good .
Then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality , which sucks .
life is stages ; this stage of your life is timeless , no way out .
At some point , you wish it was all an illusion . You need a time machine that makes it possible to go back in time to when you could see the purity of life ..
However , here you are completely different , made of life lessons , preferring to keep a stiff upper lip , cowering in your own reality .
Television can improve knowledge of current affairs .
Education does n't depend on current affairs or related concepts .
Television helps us to find the fields that interest us , like music , sports , movies or nature .
These days , television allows us to see events all around the world .
However , there are quite a lot of disadvantages to television .
In particular , fake news spreads faster without much effort .
It depends on the individual , how they make use of the opportunity .
Watching TV seems to be top of our list of things to do after a long hard day 's work with a hot cup of tea in dark winters .
TV was and is seen as entertainment , but have you ever questioned whether it is more than just entertainment ?
Now that is an interesting question . We can watch anything from news to Catfish the TV show . In the name of entertainment , we are actually learning .
The truth is we are always learning , but how we learn is another matter . The main types of learners are auditory , visual , and kinesthetic .
TV stimulates two learning styles , which are visual and auditory .
Some may argue that TV just does not have sufficient content for us to be able to learn . Others may argue that TV is an amazing source of learning , e.g. we learn about new technology via a mobile phone advert aired on TV .
We learn about social values , world news etc .
I have personally picked up information I would not have come across otherwise . For example , I have been able to learn that the new BMW seven series , has ambient lighting , it can pull in and out of the garage at the touch of a button , it 's computerised system can read different road surfaces and adapt it s driving .
So , have you ever asked yourself whether television entertains , but can also educate ?
Blues , Rock ' n ' Roll , and folk music were the basis of the new music .
From 1966 - 1967 huge changes took place .
The 3 types of music were even known in 1963 .
Every music expresses different feelings .
And after that , everybody started to change their type of music .
Then music changed to multimedia .
And so the old music changed to the new music .
The circuit is characterised by long straights and chicanes , which makes it possible to achieve high speeds .
Drivers drive the cars at full throttle for over 75% of the lap , longer than other circuits .
In my opinion , driving at high speed on the long straight could cause overheating of the cars ' engines and they can blow up .
The rugged kerbs could cause the suspension to crack .
The falling leaves could block a driver 's view and block up the radiators .
I think cutting down the trees which are around the circuit and undercutting kerbs could reduce danger and technical problems on the track and we should reduce the long straights .
Global power and politics are now surprisingly centered on those which have an apex maturity of science .
Addiction to authoritative nature over other leads to the huge production of war weapons , converting the blessing nature of science into critics .
Despite all of the assistance of science in daily life , it is not without criticism in different areas .
Science replaces human labor with tools , but what about happiness ?
There is no definition of happiness in scientism or how could it get through the scientific user manual ?
Very often , it has been criticized for changing indigenous cultures through so - called luxurious development that is contradictory to religious faith .
Science is concerned only with information about the world , whatever it is , and sometimes in unethical conclusions without considering morality .
It occupies so pivotal a role in modern society and commands so much public money , it should find itself subject to criticism from a variety of sources .
But living in the 21st century , it 's difficult to blame science when we are benefited through its technological applications in our everyday life to an ever - greater extent .
My country is pretty clean compared to the cities and countries that I know . Although there are a few pieces of paper or plastic on the streets , residents have a great respect for nature .
In fact , they keep the woods clean and the owners send the loggers to remove dead trees now or those that could lead to hazards , but every time you remove a tree , it is immediately replaced with a young plant so that the environment does not undergo changes that will lead out balance the system .
For waste management across the country , even in the countryside , we have bins for recycling paper , plastic , glass and waste .
Three times a week , garbage trucks come to empty them , and once a week a garbage collector comes to clean up the streets .
Travelling using any form of transport has become one of our needs . In the past , people used to spend hours waiting for public transport . Now , we can afford any of those modern cars at the dealership .
The future of public transport is fading away . You might ask why .
The main problem is bad service . For example , the drivers are not careful enough when driving , and that might be unsafe for passengers .
Another disadvantage is the unclean chairs on public transport .
Those are the main reasons that could make public transport disappear .
I consider buying a car the best option , so we can feel safe .
Firstly , it is a good idea for young children to do physical activity . That is the first step to doing exercise , then competing in sports will encourage competitors to make an extra effort .
Also , just for young children that are in the process of growth and development , physical exercise is essential , because they can have a healthier life .
Young children try to make an effort , and want to win at this age , and if they train , the results are better and that encourages them to keep training .
In psychic way , if you are adapated form relationships and make new friends .
In the future , adults that are able to obtain more achievements and be more responsible , and you can have a good social life if you compete in or do sports .
In addition , stress is a clear disadvantage of competing , because competitors are trying to win and this can frustrates .
But , some people do not think like this and take it more easy .
Finally , I think that competing in sports has some benefits and disadvantages , but when it is controlled there are some benefits that help you in your whole life .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
For upcoming enhancement , I would like to inform you that there are no longer any public transportation services since travel by car is more convenient .
Therefore travel by car is ready now .
The aim of this report is to outline what shopping facilities there are in our town and write some tips for tourists with different preferences .
Although our town is quite small , there are a wide variety of shops , such as clothes shops , sports shops , toy shops or book shops .
Even though the shops are not large , there are remarkable goods . For example , nice running shoes or valuable books .
All in all , the shops have a variety of goods which could attract many tourists .
If you have a small child , you can visit toy shops , which offer many cars and helicopters .
On the other hand , you can visit book shops if you are a pensioner and you have a lot of free time .
To sum up , I think our town offers many interesting shops .
Moreover , the goods are quite cheap .
Halloween is a traditional holiday in the USA but the original history came from the Celtic people .
The immigrants came with this religious culture and with time it has become part of American culture .
Today , this holiday is celebrated around the world and you can have fun with a party or dress up in a costume .
Second is to prepare metal plates using qualified machinists .
When one side is printed , they raise the images slightly to make the opposite side colored .
Last is the key step ; inspection .
It is of great importance to inspect the printed sheets .
If the sheet is good or partially damaged , it can be packed and delivered by vehicles after being cut into separate notes .
Otherwise , the sheets and notes will be abandoned and destroyed in a fire .
The issue of whether there is no future for public transport is a topic that has caused an ongoing argument . In my essay , i intend to discuss contravening viewpoint in more depth .
First , some people believe that public transport is a significant part of our life and it 's more difficult to rely only on our cars .
Hi my name is Chai . I 'm from Thailand . I am trying to write an article to improve my writing skills and hope this program can help me .
My favorite way to travel is by plane because I like to be fast and , in my life , I hate waiting . In my opinion , the plane is the best for me . For example , when you want to go somewhere you need to reach there so quickly , you do n't want to take a long time . And the plane is the best way of travelling in the world and is safer than other ways . You can see on the pollution of people who have had an accident , how often an accident happens by plane , so anyway if it has happened , I ca n't imagine it . Finally , I hope everyone who likes to travel is safe and sound and has a safe journey .
First of all , Television has less viewers nowadays .
Most people turn to Internet websites or applications like Netflix or Youtube .
Now let 's go back to those days when young people still watched television for entertainment .
Most people watched the news , movies , or TV shows on television .
Also , there were a lot of different channels that we chose from .
As I remember , there were educational channels like Discovery and National Geographic .
Those channels always contained a lot of new technology .
Some people may think that only these kinds of channel can provide educational knowledge , and some people do n't consider watching these channels as entertainment .
But these kinds of channel are both entertainment and educational .
But I wo n't suggest that these are the only channels that can provide knowledge .
All kinds of shows can give you all kinds of different knowledge , even when you watch movies .
But , of course , there will be some channels that are not suitable for children under 18 or are just for adults .
I think there is no channel that you ca n't learn from .
All kinds of programs have something that you can think about , it just depends on how you look at it .
Yes , of course , but only when you look at it as a way you want to learn something .
My studies at the Tecnologico de Monterrey are demanding and challenging because it has a very high educative score worldwide , but also has so many good things . For example , we have a lot of exchanges all around the world . When you have the opportunity to do an exchange , you have to deal with the language and the culture of the other country . That means you have to be responsible for studying the basic things about that country , but all of this is worthwhile because when you are there you have so much fun .
I think that a complete sport is swimming for most people .
I really enjoy it because it gives me a lot of relaxation and it helps me to be toned and satisfied with myself .
I advise people to start this sport , because it is complete and makes your mind and body feel very good .
When I was fourteen years old , I won a championship because , in that period , I swam as a competitive athlete .
It was a real satisfaction and I was happy .
Nowadays , I 'm really grateful to my parents because they have spent money for me and I have to thank them .
I think this sport is the most complete compared to the other sports .
Your muscles become more efficient and toned and you get a lot of benefits for the body .
The aim of the report is to write about how our town takes care of the environment .
I did some research and these are my findings .
We have a lot of bins around the area , so now we can throw our litter away wherever we are .
Also , we have recycling bins for paper and glass .
We do everything to make our town more green . Our citizens always have new ideas that make a difference to our daily lives .
It is common that more and more people get overweight , because of too much fast food and an unhealthy lifestyle .
Now some scientists have suggested having warnings on some types of food and drink .
But is this idea a way to reduce the bad habit of consuming harmful foodstuffs ?
On the one hand , I ca n't imagine that a little notice on the food can force people to stop their shopping and read the warnings .
First of all , we need to make people aware of the current environmental situation in order to take action to help the environment .
To begin with , we have to try to use the car or the bus as little as possible and try to get to any place on foot or by bicycle .
This action would decrease the amount of gas emitted into the environment .
In addition , the issue of water is another big problem .
Nowadays , people are wasting water instead of saving it .
One basic solution for this is to try not to take a shower for so long but to take a shower with a bucket and for just a few minutes .
Talking about rubbish , it is very important to separate it into the following types : metal , plastic , organic , glass and cardboard in order to make the collection task easy for the dustman .
However , we also have to try not to create more rubbish but to recycle most of it .
For example , organic rubbish can be used as fertilizer , the metal scrap can be taken to the melting factory and so can the glass .
Therefore , the environment is not going to recover if we do not decide to play our part in dealing with this global problem .
There were Long and the writer ...
One night , Paxton was speaking with them about the crown that had spoken with an old man ( Bob Cartes ) and said to him to about the family Agers who protected the crown .
But one of them had died a little while ago and he was the one who protected the crown .
Paxton goes to the house of Williams Agers and finds the crown in the hill .
But Long and The Writer helped to bury the crown again because the shadow was following him .
One day in the morning , Paxton was waiting for Long and the writer , but he heard that someone was calling him . Suddenly , he goes to the beach and is killed by the shadow .
As we 've seen , these days , the number of cars is increasing so much every year .
As a consequence of an increase in the number of private cars .
Governments around the world have been talking a lot about the measures that should be taken to improve the quality of public transport .
No doubt travelling by car is quite a lot better than going by public bus .
Although Louis felt nervous , she realised this was the opportunity of a lifetime .
I was manager at a retail store .
Every day , work stressed me and by the end of my shift I was so tired .
The program I started at school was very tough for me , because of my slow English writing .
I do not have very good English writing skills .
My grammar and spelling are weak .
I am struggling at school .
I am trying my best and hope I will pass my course and get a good job .
I 'm really sorry , you ca n't come over because my father is in hospital for 14 days .
The future of transport is public , because there will be less traffic .
When the people travel by car it is for work , holidays or for other reasons .
We should use the less car . It is very polluting .
I will start with old vehicles . If we do n't do any maintenance , this type will be damaged and we will lose it .
In the future , every person will use his own car and there will be no need for public transport . This type of transport has a route and just takes you to specific places and you ca n't use it to go to small streets .
But in some countries , you can use the underground ( metro ) . It is more advanced than old types , like bus or taxi . The underground is faster and cleaner and .
About pollution . It is a big issue in public transport . time if you try to fix the engines of public transport , that will be expensive , because with time the lifetime of this engine will come to an end .
Michael is a 22-year - old man , he has studied for a degree in electrical engineering and now he wants to put his knowledge into practice .
He went to buy a newspaper to search for a job . He looked at all the advertisements but he never found the one he needed .
Michael thought that it was time to do something .
He could not be at home all day doing nothing , so he started to look for another job that would be suitable for him .
When he was a kid , he wanted to work in a video games shop , so luckily for him there was a job available at the Play Station store .
Of course , he did not think twice and went to print out his CV because the interview was that day . Then he took a shower and dressed for the occasion .
He prepared something to eat fast , brushed his teeth , he just picked up his mobile , keys and money , but he had n't noticed that he was forgetting his CV .
It is an interesting activity ! There is the Fifa World Cup too !
There are soccer lessons . I have attended lessons .
First , the teacher will train us in soccer techniques .
But we could break our legs .
He is tall and smart . He looks like a movie star .
My father has many hobbies , he plays football , reads newspapers and listens to the radio .
In my opinion , family is more important than friends , but I probably spend more time with my friends than my family . I know if I need something my family is always there .
The difficulty is that you rarely know if your best friend is a true friend .
Unfortunately , my best friend deceived me . I do n't know how she managed it , but she hurt me .
My cousins are very reliable , like my grandmother and my parents .
The family has a blood bond , so we have a natural empathy .
For all rules there are exceptions .
You need to discover who is your best friend . As you go through life , you will learn who is who .
grew up with me and now she is my sister too .
My city is Ja√©n . It 's in the east of Andalucia and is an important crossroads between the south and the center of Spain .
So an important historical place is St. Katherine 's castle .
This is an old castle from the 10th century and the style is Arabian .
It 's on top of a big hill with difficult slopes to climb up because the most important property is that it is impregnable .
In the reconquest age the stronghold never fell to a direct assault . Finally the Castellan 's army , after a long siege , forced the government to surrender it .
Then , in the 18th century , the Napoleonic army lived in it until the end of the Spanish war of independence .
The French army destroyed it before going back to France .
These days , the castle has been restored and has a history museum . It also has a great hotel with four stars for tourists .
I like this place because I can enjoy good views of my city .
Planes , trains , and boats are the ways to travel .
I think the boat is the best way to travel and I have three reasons for my opinion .
First of all , a boat travels on the sea and the sea is very beautiful .
For instance , when we travel on the sea , we can see many types of animals , such as birds , turtles , and fishes .
Next , a boat is usually very big , so we can do many activities on it , such as dancing , drinking .
Finally , it is the safest way to travel , because we do not have many dangers , such as crashing , falling , any other kinds of danger in the sea .
Therefore , I prefer a boat for travelling , instead of a train or a plane .
All in all , travelling on the sea with a boat can be very interesting and comfortable , in addition , it is very safe .
Have you ever been rafting ? Do you know how amazing it is to do this cool sport ? If you do n't know anything about it , it 's high time you did !
I had n't ever heard of doing rafting until my best friend , Carmen , asked me whether I wanted to have a whale of a time with her and I accepted it .
Therefore , we went to join a sports centre which had taken over organising this amazing outdoor activity .
Rafting lets you burn all your adrenaline while you try to get down a river in a mini - boat .
In addition , you 'll enjoy the breathtaking landscapes around you and you 'll also see a vast range of wildlife on both sides of the river .
Nevertheless , I would recommend you to wear appropriate clothes and to bring sun cream with you .
In contrast , you could suffer some nasty cuts or , though , be sunburnt .
Do not hesitate to take up rafting !
You wo n't regret it !
In my life I have had big experiences that have made me change and mature .
One of the most important experiences , I think , was coming to study in Tijuana .
It was a real challenge for me to live alone .
Before I came here , I was so dependent on my parents and I had a lot of fear , but I learned to overcome all the things that stopped me .
When I was child I lived in Tijuana .
When I was 4 years , old I went to live in Ensenada because my father worked there .
From when I was born to when I was 18 years old , I was living with them , but now I live in a small apartment .
I am studying Nutrition at the University . That is why I am living in Tijuana .
I used to live in assistent house . It was the first place where I lived in Tijuana , then I moved to an apartment with two friends .
Every weekend , I used to go to Ensenada to visit my family , my boyfriend and my friends .
Before I came to live in Tijuana , I was really nervous because I had to leave everything and because it would be a change in my life .
To sum up , coming to live in Tijuana was a real challenge for me .
I do not regret what I did , because I am doing what I like .
Now I am so independent and I have learned how to live alone .
I live in a small village in countryside with only a few people .
Even if we are a small village , we take care of the environment through the use of photovoltaic systems on the roofs of many buildings , such as the nursery school and other buildings that have this system to produce energy .
We separate paper from glass and also plastic .
The garbage truck picks up paper once a week , plastic two times per month and undifferentiated three times a week for all people who live in my country .
My district makes my village clean and it usually tries to make it attractive with new social initiatives for the community .
All people in the world have friends . I 'm not an exception .
When I was 10 years old , I met my best friend .
We have been friends since we started to talk , but our friendship has changed over time .
When we were 12 , we played in the garden with balls and with the other boys and girls , but when we were 12 years old , everything changed . We did n't want to play in the garden because we preferred cinema or watching TV .
Because of age changing us , we did n't see each other , but when we had grown up more , we met on the weekends and sometimes were upset about some problems that we had .
With time we became closer friends .
Now , we argue sometimes but we love each other because he always stay together in the good times to have a coffee or talk about our lives , but we also stay together in the bad times , despite being friends since we were 10 years old .
For this reason , I think that friendship is such an important thing in life .
I think the opposite . I believe that public transportation has a really huge future .
It is true that there are a lot of users that want to use a car and that number is growing . There are also a lot of people that do n't have the possibility to have a car and some use public transportation for many reasons , like the price , because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than a car , or because of the traffic . Sometimes it is so exhausting for people to drive for many hours and even sometimes public transportation is faster .
The population is growing so fast , we need public transportation . It is important .
Public transportation is convenient for some people and some people think the car is more convenient . Finally , we will need public transportation in the future .
In our opinion , globalization is a good thing that is happening to us , allowing us to interact with the whole world , so we can get to know cultures , monuments , etc .
It brings us a lot of opportunities to change and , in some cases , to get a better life in other countries and find a job with the highest salary .
However , we need to change some things in the world , more than these is to change a lot of things in third world countries , because it is not acceptable that in the twenty - first century a person has to live on less than a dollar per day .
I 'm writing about my summer job at the Cinema .
It was really brilliant , because I could see a lot of films for free and I met all the young people of my country .
In the morning , I walked around the cinema and the most important place in my country and I talked about the films that people could watch .
They asked a lot of questions and I very funny for this .
I could n't buy tickets for the films but I could give a lot of discounts to all my friends !
I hope that you are having fun like me .
They paid me a lot of money and I was able to buy a lot of dresses , jeans , shoes , books and make - up .
I saw the new Disney film , " Inside out " and I ate a lot of popcorn !
I cried a lot in this film , but it was very important to me because I love Disney films .
Looking forward to your answer
First of all , this is a report that will explain how the city of Vancouver handles their rubbish .
Firstly , the city of Vancouver has a programme called Go Green Vancouver that will protect the environment by separating the rubbish by containers . At the same time , there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provide 3 containers for each house ; one for paper one for bottles , and the last one for rubbish materials .
Secondly , there is a programme with the water company to cut down on the use of water by 50% using a recycling water treatment and recirculating to the house without dumping the waste and so saving our planet .
Finally , every city hall is improving the care of the environment because there is an incentive programme from the government , such that if they cut the of every house by 50% , city halls will get more money from central government .
I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element for speaking English . If you know grammar , you only know certain rules for writing , but I think that speaking is more important than writing , because when you go to any place in the world , you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you . In this part you may notice that if you do n't know vocabulary , you wo n't understand anything . But here is another topic . Whether you understand or not , you have to notice the way that people talk to you , and try to understand what the person is trying to say .
With reference to your e - mail , we discovered that the price should be USD 122 instead of 222 .

Cycling is my favourite sport .
It helps me keep healthy .
It leep me in a positive mood .
I can see a lot of scenery in a short time . I can buy goods along the road .
Buying a good bike is the first to do when you start to cycle .
Cycle one or twice a week .
It can prevent colds .
It is clear that technology has provided us with several options for communication .
Perhaps the clearest example of this is that , unlike in the past , it is not necessary to buy envelopes and stamps to send a letter .
Another way this change is evident is that social networking or applications such as Skype , FaceTime and Facebook are widely used to stay in touch with family , friends and relatives
You need to play it in a team .
You need to have skill to play it .
This sport is about catching the ball and scoring .
I enjoy this because I like it .
In some cases , you could have an accident , but that 's not likely .
When I 'm playing this sport I have great moments and I learn more and I will have more experience in the future .
It is n't difficult and you can start to play .
Anybody can do this sport .
Basketball is recognized by people all over the world .
I see myself as a perfect candidate for this position .
I am writing to apply for the job in a summer camp advertised on February 9th in the local newspaper .
I have worked for the last 10 years as a teacher in junior school .
Now I want to utilize my summer to help children in different activities .
I have experience of arranging different sports activities for children .
I am very good at cooking as well , so I think I can be helpful in the kitchen also . I am confident that my profile makes me a very suitable candidate for the summer camp .
Yours faithfully
And there is good communication between us .
In my opinion , every family must have good communication , because I think communication is one of the most important things in our life .
We use communication all the time .
However , families that do n't have good communication do n't have a good life .
If we want to have a good life , we must have good communication in our families .
I live in one of the most beautiful countries - Ukraine .
When I was at school my friends and I attended junior swimming school .
That was 30 years ago .
My friend and I always had ice cream and fun after training .
I work in an office and have no idea where my friends are .
This year I decided to start visiting a pool and swimming up to three times a week .
Now , when I swim in the open pool , I am overwhelmed by positive emotions .
Nowadays , the option of broadening the mind while traveling is very common .
I think that it is not the only way , but it is the best way .
Apart from that , you see new places and you have fun . You also learn about other cultures , historical facts , you also learn to respect other people and their customs .
In addition , you do n't think about your problems and the only thing that you do is have fun and do what you want to do .
Besides , you see new worlds and their ways of life and that helps to open your mind , to see the world in another way .
In conclusion , I think that it is the best way to open your mind . Not the only way , but yes , the best way .
Many countries have truly started to be concerned about the environment and worried about globe warming . In schools , teachers are doing their best to educate children in how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy . Also , they teach them in how to plant trees in the public gardens of their towns .
Although the government strict so many laws and taxes on the people who do not pay their taxes to the council for removal of the rubbish from towns and villages , in the biggest polluted city in the world , people have started to use bicycles and cycle instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city . Also , they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive .
First of all , I disagree with that statement , because of the reasons I am about to give .
Once we stop using public transport , it is going to cause problems .
For example , if we completely rely on using cars it is going to increase the use of gasoline .
Apparently , it is going to cause more pollution and more global warming issues .
However , using cars makes life easier , but when everyone or every house owns at least three cars , it is too much .
Although traffic jams , accidents etc .. .
Public transport is really important and it has a lot of advantages to help humanity .
In my opinion , every country should have different kinds of public transport ;
For instance , San Francisco is a great example of an incredible city . The variety of choices of public transport is remarkable .
In spite of the cost of these facilities , it is going to be expensive , but it is necessary .
In conclusion , governments should work on that , because people need public transport and the world for the environment , life expanses it is much cheaper than having a car .
I hope to see it around the world . Public transport is something we can not do without or replace with another thing .
Cars will be safer and speedier than now .
Traveling by car will be the most suitable
way to move from one place to another .
Recommend to friends what country they should go to .
I would like to recommend friends to visit Italy .
First of all , nowadays , wherever we go we can find Italian restaurants easily .
There is a lot of food all over the world .
but I think Italian restaurants are getting famous .
Second , beautiful tourist places like Venice .
I went to Italy when I was 20 .
There is no word to describe it .
Venice is a city that is based on water .
There are no cars , no metro in Venice .
On the other hand , it could be complicated , but nobody complains .
I think that 's why this city can maintain a safe environment .
It attracts many fashionable people .
If you are a person who loves fashion , you will enjoy going there .
So it makes me excited .
So if you want to visit any country , I 'm going to recommend Italy .
The biggest anecdote , that I have with my friend , was our trip to Disney World .
Where we were able to visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom , Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom .
In addition , we were able to visit other parks , like Universal and Bush Garden .
But this is not the end of our trip . We went on a voyage on a Royal Caribean cruise ship , where all the food and drink was free , because it was also paid .
During the voyage , we disembarked in the Bahamas and CoCo kay , which is a private island belonging to the cruise . We went to the beach and played so many games .
To sum up , this trip was the best experience we have had in our lives , because we made friends , visited a new country and we had a lot of fun .
I 'm thirteen years old and live in Stocksund with my two families ( they do n't all live in the same house ) .
I have a dog named Atlas and he is a Berner Sennen/ Landser .
I love horses and I do horse riding at Djursholms ridklubb .
I take care of a horse called Lady .
My grandpa lives in Spain with my stepgrandma , but she is like my grandma .

I do n't like spiders or shoots .
I went to an awesome concert of points of view and I look forward to telling you how it was .
But let me tell you it was a concert by the Lala Band and I have taken and I especially , I was the cameraman .
The concert began at 20:00 and a lot of people came .
Their . Their voices have positive vibration through their music and give you a good feeling .
On the stage they move very well and know how to give pleasure to the public .
I feel wonderful and my promise is that when I have a special occasion to go to a concert supported by Lala Band , you will be with me .
I . I hope as those recounted by me in this mail and you feel a slight vibration from the concert .
I heard that you really have a lot of work activities now .
Yesterday I watched Fast to Furious at the cinema .
You know that I love action films like this .
While watching the film , I imagined if I was the fiancee of Adam .
OMG , I can ' t stop imagining it still .
The main character is so cool , charismatic , and patient .
You must watch it too , because your favorite actor is also in this film .
He is in a secondary role , but I am really sure you will have imagined as liar as me too .
Why are there so many cool men in this world ?
The latest exciting movie that I am looking forward to is " Get hard " starring Kevin Heart and Will Ferrell .
This movie is based on racial humor .
Kevin Heart is in a difficult situation because he is nothing at all what this man expects him to be , but he plays the role anyway .
The movie is already a success , opening at the box office with a $ 36 million endorsement .
I am very excited about seeing Kevin Heart and Will Ferrell 's characters come together .
I think if you 're a comedy fan you will be excited about seeing this movie and , even if you 're not , the movie is a must - see .
Dear Sir ,
I am used to children . I have two sisters who are 9 and 11 years old and I take care of them all the time .
I am not used to cooking for this number of people , but I am a hard worker and I am a fast learner , so I am certain that I will be a great help to you this summer .
I hope that you consider my application and contact me about the job .
I checked connections between Warsaw and Berlin and she will be at Berlin Ostbf station at 11.10 .
I think in the future it wo n't be necessary to use public transport . And why ?
To put it simply , the new generation has decided to take their driving licence and I have seen this around me , with my colleagues , my friends , my family .
It 's just a question of time until everybody has a car .
This affirmation : travelling by car is so much more convenient , says everything . For example , if we think of the time we spend on waiting for a bus to arrive at our destination , and the traffic is one of a lot of things that makes everyone prefer to buy a car . It is more practical and faster .
Do n't forget the cost .
In my opinion , the price of a ticket on the bus is expensive .
Every year the price of public transport goes up .
We can stop and do some mental arithmetic and we can see the large amount of money we spend each year .
If we have a car , I believe we do n't spend much money .
It 's just my opinion , because this is my life , so I know what I am talking about .
Every month I buy my pass to use on the bus .
I am part of the new generation who in the future will use cars and the public transport will disappear .
I 'm from Italy . I live in Varese , a beautiful town not far from Milan in Lombardia .
Varese has many attractions among which there is the lake , where I like to go .
My favourite place in the town is Estensi gardens , where I go walking with my friends in the afternoon .
But Michael sometimes has a problem .
He is proud ; it 's not a good way to be .
On Saturday they fought and Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transport is important for everyone .
People should walk more than before .
Nowadays , many accidents happen when people are driving their cars .
They travel around all over the world by plane .
The young people feel happier .
The author claimed that the business dropping is caused by the increasing number of skateboard users .
Likewise , the skateboard users brought a lot of garbage that affects the stores in the plaza .
Based on the author 's two concerns , the statement that came to the conclusion that to prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza is not a thoughtful and wise decision .
First of all , there is a contradiction in the argument .
If more skateboard users are willing to go to Central Plaza , there are more customers to help the growth of business .
This is contrary to the author 's assertion .
From this point view , the decrease in business must be caused by other factors , but not skateboard users .
However , there are many reasons that can cause business to drop off .
Probably , the stores are too old in Central Plaza , which could not attract customers to walk into them , and they will have to be renovated .
Furthermore , the products for sale in the stores might not meet customers ' needs .
The above reasons could influence the business in Central Plaza directly .
Second , the author claimed that the sanitation problem caused by skateboard users is not only happen by specific person , whenever more customers should bring more waste and wrongdoing .
Those problems suggest that there is not sufficient security in Central Plaza .
Moreover , the problem would case by skateboarding immediately is the skateboard users taking over pedestrian walking space .
To solve this problem , the city should set up more space and facilities for skateboarding , and separate the different spaces for walking and skateboarding .
To sum up , the author 's prediction wo n't happen if the city prohibits skateboarding .
In contact author 's concerns , the increasing skateboard users would bring more potential to improve business in Central Plaza .
On the other hand , the author should provide profound discussion why people who come to Central Plaza do n't shop there .
The condition of the stores and safety are two crucial factors that affect business in the plaza .
To strengthen the author 's conclusion , the author should put the factors above into the argument .
I have a big family which consists of three sisters and one brother .
But when comparing my family with my father 's family ,
I do n't feel that , because he has five sisters and three brothers .
When my sisters are married they have one or two children at most . I think the Egyptian family has become smaller with the passage of time .
Cocaine is the most dangerous addiction .
Firstly , cocaine damages your senses and your mind . If you take cocaine , you wo n't sleep that day .
Secondly , it 's so addictive , because the body needs more and more , so if you take cocaine , you will leave because you 'll be an addict .
Finally , the consequence of cocaine is death . If you inhale cocaine all the time or a lot , you will die prematurely .
In conclusion , cocaine is the most dangerous addiction , because you die prematurely and your body is destroyed by the cocaine .
Yeah , first time is OK .
But if you want , I see some work in special Feel free to show me via note or mention ^^
There is an increasing trend towards private transport so that public transport will be reduced in the future .
Ultimately , public transport will be negligible in the future .
There are so many reasons that could affect the public transport system .
The main one is that nowadays people are incredibly busy with their day to day life , so that they do n't like to spend their valuable time waiting for regular transport . Also , public transport causes lots of pollution which is harmful for human beings .
For example , lunchtime travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emissions of carbon mon oxide , which affects red blood cells and irritates the respiratory system . As a result , they prefer private transport systems to prevent such hazards .
Finally , the public transport system is not always safe .
To illustrate , if teenage girls travel by public transport every day who will interact with society beyond the limitation.so it is a big challenge for them .
To whom it may concern
I am writing this e - mail because we want to hire your company to do the accounting for our company .
Principally , we need to have the Financial States , so we need them as fast as you can because , if not , we will have legal problems .
Also , if it is the case , I would like to arrange a meeting to give you all the documents you need .
I am looking forward to your answer .
We really enjoyed it !
Your new house near the beach is very nice .
We enjoyed swimming in the sea , sunbathing , having a barbecue and seeing the sunset .
For next time , we would like to invite you to our woodhouse .
The graph shows the seasonal sales of ice - cream in two places - one is from an ice - cream van while the other is in an indoor public swimming pool , from 2012 to 2014 .
The line which represents the indoor swimming pool remains fairly steady , from approximately 1800 to 2500 , the period of every year from April to June and October to December has the highest outstanding achievement , whilst the sales are downwards overall .
However , compared to the line for the indoor swimming pool , the difference of seasonal achievement of the ice - cream van is considerably larger .
Overall , the achievement of the ice - cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool , from about 1100 to 5500 .
The best season to sell ice cream from the van is autumn , while that is one of the worst seasons for the indoor swimming pool .
The discrepancy between these two places is great .
The best sales achievement of the van is 4500 , 5000 , 5500 respectively .
One day many years ago in some place that a do n't remember the name of , I woke up one morning earlier than usual , then I went to the kitchen and shouted the name of my mother ... but no one answered , and the first thing that I imagined was that they had gone to town . Quickly , I went out to find them ...
But there was no one , absolutely no one . I was scared , I yelled and screamed , looked and looked , but I had no success .
Suddenly I felt a warm hand touch my shoulder and very slowly turned , but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife .
I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream .
Recently , when I was on YouTube , I saw a movie trailer . The film looked so good , and days later , my friends asked me if I wanted to go with them to the cinema , so I decided to go and , luckily , they had decided to see the film that I had seen days before .
The film is a romantic movie . It is about a man , Noa , who lives in a small seaside town , who falls in love with a rich girl . But like always , the girl 's parents did not like Noa 's life , because the girl 's father thinks that Noa is not good enough for their daughter .
And at the end of the summer , the girl leaves , but next year she comes again . But this time , she has a boyfriend and this breaks Noa 's heart .
What Noa does not know is that she was in love with him from the first time that she saw him .
First of all , I should say that I like a lot of different kinds of sports .
I have been swimming since childhood . I enjoy myself while I am swimming .
Swimming develops all types of muscles .
You can swim all year in the swimming pool , sea , rivers and so on .
My advice to anyone who starts swimming is to enjoy yourself while you swim .
With the rising prices for public transport in London , commuters are choosing to use their cars more and more .
Public transport was created to relieve the traffic in big town centres and also to facilitate workers ' commutes .
Nowadays , trains and buses are usually packed and the ticket fares are very expensive .
I particularly decided to drive to do my day - to - day tasks such as , shopping , visiting friends , church and so on .
To whom it may concern :
I came upon your ad in the newspaper and I wish to apply for the job .
I 'm a great people person and have great knowledge of computers , organising activities for children and also I 'm a jr . chef .
Sincerely yours ,
I also hope to meet a group of old friends once again to revive the wonderful and unforgettable shared memories of student life .
Tell me what happened at our first meeting ?
If it is unspeakably for public readings , thus mention it in the email .
I was 7 years old when I played it for the first time .
My first match was when I was in school .
We were happy .
My advice to anyone who wants to play this game , is that you do n't have to be tall or fast , when you play you have to think a lot .
I enjoy this game because the most important thing is team work . You have to understand each other .
It 's really important to be tall because you will score points faster and better .
He is a Polish basketball player .
He is really tall , he is 202 centimeters .
My history of basketball was very short .
I ca n't give you much advice , but one thing I know , team work is the most important thing in this game .
To begin , everything is very difficult here .
In the first place , my country 's politics are bad , and people have no work .
In the second place , there are very important people , and they want to have a lot of money .
Young people want to find a good job here , but they are working in MacDonald 's or Burger King for a low salary .
If you want to work here , you must know languages , for example , English , French or German .
You must be a person in charge and a worker , and you will be able to find good work .
My family have a company , and if you want , you could work with them .
I wish you lots of luck here .
If you have any problems , you can call me ! !
I will wait for your call .
Television plays an essential part in our life ; we turn it on nearly every day , since it can make life more interesting .
There are two points to prove it .
For one , a show broadcast on television may enlighten us and give us some enlightenment .
Teleplays are not just for fun ; they can have a deep meaning . A short story tells big , just like a useful book .
So , why ca n't television educate us ?
For another , there are many different types of programs which can broaden our views ; they give details of education , plus other meaningful information , such as documentaries , talk shows and so on .
These programs are not just for killing time , but for educating .
To sum up , television entertains ; it can also educate .
It has all kinds of food , even really fancy food .
You can enjoy having your breakfast there with your family , because they have so many types of food .
This restaurant also has games for children , which they can spend their time playing with .
It also includes a huge car park , so you can park your own car for free .
On Friday they serve special food for those who do n't have enough money to pay .
It 's a very nice restaurant which I like the most .
The invention of the car made people 's lives easier .
No No longer do they have to solely depend on public transport .
Though public transport is cheaper and one could get to know many people , and increase one 's network .
But public transport has a fixed schedule and on a busy day not many can really enjoy their journey .
Public transport ca n't help when one has to travel suddenly or to go somewhere that it does n't pass through .
At those times , a car is convenient to use .
Ever increasing crowds in cities and traffic problems are increasing .
These days , houses are very different , but in the future houses will be
The future houses will be different not in terms of architecture , but in terms of functionality .
Different people will need different functions , options and functionality in the future house .
This will be like in ancient times , but in the past the houses were the same all round .
The progress of technology is very fast .
From : horses , steam vehicle , first petrol and gas car to future cars when the fuel will be electricity .
The last film I saw was " The Enormous Island " , so I am going to review it for the students film club .
The film that I selected stars Scarlett Johansson and Brad Pitt .
The film was produced in 2010 by the well - known director Stanley Kubrick .
The film tells us the story of Monica ( Scarlett Johansson ) and her routine life on " Cretacro " , an enormous mysterious island located in the Pacific Ocean . The problems start when Monica falls in love with Martin .
Martin was a solitary and quiet guy who moved to Cretacro to relax , but he changed when he met Monica in the main restaurant .
I work in a coffee shop in the city centre .
One of my main responsibilities is preparing something by 7.30 am so I get up at 6 every morning and I leave home for work at 6.45 am .
I finish work at about 5 pm .
After that , I go to English class 3 days a week .
In addition , I spend my free time doing Yoga or cooking good meals for my family .
My hobby
I really like to read everything I can catch and I will have a look in every book to see what it is about .
Often , I like to read biographies , history books and novels , and I really like Jane Austen 's books .
I have all her collected works at home and I enjoy a lot having a trip with her characters in Bath and all around . I like to read children 's books and I had lots of fun with Beatrix Potter books and all her little animals ; with Peter and all of them .
At home I have lots of books here and in my country , but I like to go to the library and sometimes I go and have a look in charity shops and at boot sales , because I can find lots of nice books and pay a very good price for them .
When I need a book for my English classes , I go to Waterstone or to Amazon .
A few months ago , I read Les Miserables , by Victor Hugo . I read this book when I was in high school , but I did n't think about the subject .
But now I really enjoyed it , and my best friend bought me a ticket to a theatre to see the musical show , which was amazing . For s couple of hours , I did n't move . It was a brilliant present .
This Saturday , I started a new book by Francine River , the book is called The Warrior . I haven't finished the first chapter , but I find the book very good .
I have read other books by this writer and I really enjoyed them .
Public transport in the near future
Nowadays , there are many modes of public transportation , such as underground , buses , etc . , but it is a reality that people prefer to travel by car .
Currently , traveling by car is more useful than public transport ; you can move around the city and reduce the time it takes . Sometimes you can share your car with friends or family and this way of travelling is cheaper .
Teacher , I know travelling by car is the most convenient .
However , I think your opinion is similar to what our forebears thought , because for them , society was never going to get the transport we have nowadays .
It is difficult for us to imagine a world in which there are not cars like we are used to seeing .
Nevertheless , I believe that technology will make progress in the future .
Moreover , we still have a lot of things which we can and must improve , like security , comfort and economic resources .
On the other hand , we should know that every means of transportation may be changed in 50 years .
Maybe we will invent flying cars or electric bikes .
For all these reasons , I think that we should be prudent when we assess means of transportation .
According to Wordsworth , a poet is not an ordinary man , he has a greater sensitivity and knowledge .
The power of imagination makes him become a teacher : he has to show men how to understand their feelings and the nature that surrounds them .
Sometimes I give them some information about the names of streets or where the main monuments are .
I have no particular problem helping them , but I often have some doubts about suggesting a place to go shopping .
The reason is that in my city there are a lot of good shopping facilities for tourists .
An example could be to have free entry to the Campidoglio museum if you buy a local newspaper .
Also , there are some well - known brands ready to give a special prize if you buy a souvenir after 8 pm .
As you see , there are a lot of opportunities for tourists to spend their money in my city .
You have only to choose what is the best for you .
You will not regret it .
Hello , I really want this job , because I 'm a happy person who enjoys nature , travelling around the world , and having a lot of friends .
I 'd like to work in the team area , and shows , and tell stories , because I like to talk to people , and I like kids .
I can speak English and I really enjoy doing so .
My town makes great efforts to take care of the environment . They have put many bins in the streets to keep it clean and they prevent private transport on many days to keep the air clean . They plant trees to absorb co2 and release oxygen , they build factories away from the houses of citizens to prevent the respiratory diseases which are a result of air pollution from factories . So , not only my country itself but also individuals follow a proper procedure to keep the environment clean .
The game starts with a ball at the centre of the field and then one of the two teams kicks it .
The goal is to get the ball inside the opponents ' net using only your foot .
In 1994 , The Scream , one of the most expensive paintings in the world , was stolen from the National Gallery of Oslo ( Norway ) .
At first , the police detectives thought one of the special gangs had stolen the painting .
Then , researchers found out that Pal Enger , the most famous art thief in Norway , was the person who had stolen the painting .
He only needed 50 seconds to steal the painting .
When he stole the painting he wrote a note saying : " thank you for your good security " and when he was arrested he declare that it was very easy to steal the painting .
3 months ago , he wanted 1 million dollars for the painting , but the Norwegian government said no .
Finally , the Norwegian police got the painting back thanks to a police investigation .
In particular , I am highly skilled at welcoming and directing customers .
I also have problem - solving skills .
In my previous job , I was paid the compliment that
whenever there was a problem , I could notice it and could solve it quickly .
I can provide extraordinary service with a smile , even if I was in an unexpected situation .
With these qualifications and personality , I believe that they will prove me to be an ideal candidate for 5-star Cabin Crew at Qatar Airways .
Wasting time is a huge issue in our lives . A lot of knowledge is related to time , such as history , education and health .
We discuss a special topic about ‚ÄΩtime . This famous quote explains my previous idea " time is a sword ; if you do not cut it , it will cut you " .
Many people do n't care about wasting their time even when they are busy .
Actually , in my life , I consider it as the king of my system , who controls the whole of my day .
There are some people treat time like something of their own , they have the right to waste it and the right to look after it .
On the other hand , some people let time control their lives .
However , we should have a balance between both types .
She wasted it . She can not get it back .
Imagine how you would live if you did n't have knowledge of the thing called ' time ' .
I did not care about time . I used to say , this is my life and my time .
But this changed after my brother arranged with me to organize our time .
He would leave me at home or I had to pay him two riyals for every minute if I was late for him .
When I asked him to take me someplace , I can not count how many times I stayed at home because I was late .
I think that there is a future for public transport , because there are still people who can not afford to buy a car , even though travelling by car is much more convenient .
We have to consider that people need to earn sufficient money to support their families and be able to buy a car .
I 'm a hard - working person and I like children .
In the workplace I 'm a responsible person , I am never late .
Also , I always work with children and I have a teaching qualification . I'm a friendly person and I have a good CV .
My experience of this job is extensive .
I began to work 4 years ago in a special children 's school .
This job is great because I also learn a lot of things .
I like to do sports activities and educational activities .
My favourite activities are out in the open air .
I like to prepare my activities a week before , then when I have to do this activity it is quicker .
I think that this job is for the children 's enjoyment , so I 'm the right person because I like playing with them .
In terms of making bank notes , the picture below demonstrates the process of making them .
There are mainly 4 steps : design , preparation , printing and inspecting .
This essay will explain these different steps .
Firstly , personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the security features on the bank notes , which is also done in process of other card , such , such as notes for supermarkets .
Then , in the preparation process , skilled machinists prepare metal plates for printing .
After sheets of bank notes are printed , there are differences and specials for it , it uses special ink , and prints colors on both sides , and images are slightly raised .
Finally , inspectors at the bank manually check all printing sheets and divide them into three categories : " bad sheets " are sent for disposal , where things are securely destroyed ; " Good quality sheets " will go for packaging and distribution , where sheets are cut , packed and dispatched .
However , sheets that are " partially damaged " will be inspected again and separated into good and bad sheets and sent for further actions .
I 'd like to write on this subject because it 's a very important topic .
My favourite sport is football . I like it so much . It means a lot to me . It means partnership , teamwork , entertainment , exercise .
The whole world gets together to support their favourite teams & the boys play it in the streets together .
I enjoy it when I watch it on TV or when I attend it in the stadium & support my team with my flag & cheers .
I advise anyone who dreams of being a member of the most famous teams to work on himself a lot and play football a lot to be professional in this sport and show a lot of matches & followed by captain supervised on him
This issue is not clear - cut on both money and job satisfaction are important in deciding on a career in our life .
I think that , on balance , it is more important to try to get satisfaction .
We work eight hours a day , so if we submerge in a bloody pond for a long time , we could definitely make ourselves frustrated .
In my own case , I work as a co - cook in a diner .
Customer satisfaction brings me happiness .
Although the heat in the kitchen can burn us , the smile on the customers ' faces gives us the best courage .
Also , the satisfaction of the customers pushes me to work harder and be better at my job .
The better I can perform the more I can earn .
As a result , job satisfaction is a good way to get paid better .
I believe I could someday become a chef in my own restaurant and serve my customers a fabulous dish .
On the whole , therefore , I feel that it is best to go for a career that we will enjoy if that is possible .
I 'm writing to you with great news .
I want to tell you about the concert which I went to last month .
It was the best concert of my life .
She can make a very exciting show and surprise her fans .
The people of my city are working to keep it clean .
They have purchased green bins and they have done graffiti that says : Keep the city clean is all .
They also have a playground where children can play and moms can sit on benches and gray when grandparents accompany their grandchildren and a red deck painted with some dolls that say ,
I will talk about passion in life .
Passion is the best thing you have to achieve your goals .
Passion is something that makes you happy in your life .
When you have the desire to do something , something you always dreamt of achieving , something touches you inside not only when you do it , but also when you think about it .
You should calm down and get away from the fast lifestyle and decide to do something or apply for a job which makes you a great man , and then you will find your passion .
At the moment we have a nice house with a garden .
But what will there be in the future ?
Possibly , we will live in space or underground .
In the future , everything could change .
It could be painted with new colours .
It could have flowers .
But I think that not many things will change .
Probably , houses will be smaller or bigger .
They wo n't look like big white balls .
A variety of negative impacts appear as a result of rapid urbanization .
Urban flooding is one of them .
Not only the growing proportion of impervious surfaces , but also the " false " green infrastructure contributes to it .
Mountains of studies have demonstrated that green infrastructure is an economical , beautiful and effective strategy to control stormwater .
However , urban flooding keeps raging , even when the amount of green infrastructure fulfils the stormwater - control needs in some areas .
What is the obstacle that stopped these green infrastructures from providing the ecosystem service of mitigating and eliminating urban flooding ?
Each person has a favourite sport and so do I. I really like soccer because it is exciting and I can learn many things when I play it .
As you know , soccer is a sport which has many people in a team , so it requires us to unite and assist each other .
Most girls do n't like this . I think that it brings us energy , we need to do exercise , have a reasonable diet ... and so on .
I hope that you will try it someday and realize it is true .
Our mistakes make us better than before . If in life we did n't make any mistakes , we would n't succeed . That 's why mistakes are very important in life and I believe our mistakes improve us .
But on the other hand there just one mistake and you could not come back or arranged your mistake
This article is about what I think about the efficiency of public transport .
When I lived for more than 12 years in the countryside , I was dependent on buses and trains .
In the morning , I needed to get to school and , in the evenings , public transport helped me to get home .
I am of the opinion that more frequent and more regular transport is needed .
Spontaneous activities were impossible as you always had to plan in advance .
I could hardly wait for my 18th birthday .
I do agree television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed for several reasons .
First , this kind of advertisement should be forbidden on account of the fact that young children are still very vulnerable .
Kids around these ages ( 2 to 5 years old ) do not have a mature critical sense and anything can easily persuade them .
For instance , when I was three years old , I used to be captivated by all the toys which were presented in TV commercials just because of the way they were presented .
One of them was " the ultimate max steel " , which was about a hundred dollars .
Secondly , I am also opposed to the allowance of this advertising because of the severe consequences it has on the parents ' and child 's relationships .
It is common to see parents having issues with their kids because of this kind of commercial .
One example is what happened to my cousin Patricia when she had her first child , called Sophia .
One day , Sophia got really excited about an advertisement for a barbie doll and she could not think about anything else than having this toy .
Unfortunately , my cousin did not have enough money to buy it , but her daughter - a three - year - old kid - did not understand it and got angry with Patricia , not speaking to her for three weeks !
In conclusion , I am strongly in favour of this statement . Advertisements for young kids , not only upto 5 but upto 8 years old should be forbidden because of the kid 's vulnerability and the risk to their parents ' relationships with them .
Finally , if the advertisements are still broadcast , it is essential some educational politics comes with them , valorizing and teaching kids about understanding their parents .
You have asked for a waiter in your cafe .
I think it 's a great job for me .
I 'm very talented at working with people .
At school , I learned to cook and to wait on tables .
Also , I can work long hours .
In another job before , I worked 8 hours per day .
So I think , it 's no problem for me to stay and work the whole day .
I did a one - week internship in a restaurant in my village .
There I saw how a venture like this works and you wo n't have to show me the whole job again .
By the way , I live near to the cafe , so I have a short duty stroke and will come punctually every time .
Dear Mrs Ashby ,
I am writing in response to your advertisement which I saw in " The Daily Magazine " last week .
I would like to be considered for work in your cafe during the weekends .
I am a twenty - year - old student currently studying to be a chef .
I have some experience in this kind of job as I worked in a restaurant for two years .
I am used to dealing with people and their orders to eat , and also , I am used to working long hours as I am studying while I am trying to get a job .
If you need any further information , please do not hesitate in contact me .
Yours faithfully ,
My town is very beautiful and I like it very much because there are not any dirty streets in it .
The governor of my city is seeking to develop it and he said it will be the capital of the delta actually in 30 years .
The people in my town deal with rubbish by healthy methods . The citizens collect the rubbish and throw it in big boxes far away from the city .
Tanta will be an attractive city and it will be an important tourist destination in the future .
If you are looking for a movie to see , I recommend " Nemo " . It 's the most beautiful Disney movie .
The story is about a couple of clownfish who are attacked by a shark . Only the dad and one baby egg survived .
The baby 's name was Nemo .
When Nemo grows up , he goes to his first day at school , and there he is captured by a man .
The only thing they found was a pair of goggles that said the home of the man .
Nemo 's father knew a fish called Doris that wanted to helped him . They cross all the ocean to go to Nemo 's location to save him , while Nemo tries to survive in a dentist 's house .
They finally meet and are happy again with a lot of good friends .
When I was young , I tried Badminton , Squash and Teakwondo .
I do n't do sport now .
It is a fact that pollution is one of the biggest concerns of the modern world .
The reason can be attributed to increased consumerism and lack of awareness about waste management .
In the following paragraphs , I am going to analyze these issues in a detailed way to provide a solution .
I fully understand why it is so difficult to decide which activity is more important for you .
I think I would have the same dilemma .
However , sometimes we need to sacrifice something when we do n't have enough time for everything .
As you know , I am a person who likes sport and music , but if I had to decide which of those activities is more important , then I would choose sport .
I think physical activity can give us more benefits in our life .
For example , if you are active every day , you can keep your health in good condition .
Sports activity also makes us feel more flexible and ready to face every day .
In conclusion , I think you should give up your music classes .
Nowadays , cars are more affordable than ever .
With the development of technology , people will use other means of transport .
Bearing in mind that society is also changing , people will tend to choose a place of work which is near their home and wo n't need to spend time travelling .
We are witnessing a great development in working from home these days , which will also lead to fewer people using public transport .
Three Suggestions to be a Doctor
Do you want to be a doctor ? Many people around the world want to help people , so they choose to study medical .
If you want to be a doctor , you should do these three things .
First , you have to study hard every single day at high school .
When study hard at high school , you will be
By looking at the current situation of people 's lives , we can imagine the changes that could occur in the future .
People are not interested in physical exercise & healthy food . Instead they are very interested in earning money .
With no physical exercise & healthy food , people are damaging their health and family relations .
Now Nowadays , nobody has enough time to spend with family . Instead , they prefer to make more money by working extra hours .
If people live the same way as now , in the future , people will be considered as working robots instead of human beings .
For several reasons , I really liked to play basketball . First , playing basketball can train your muscles and make the body healthier . Second , my classmates and I all know how to win a game from basketball because basketball is a team sport .
If you play basketball and enjoy the game , you just go to the basketball court with a basketball , and try to throw the ball into the basket again and again .
Three paradigms result from the attempt to characterize Spanish tourism research epistemologically through the study of the AECIT Conference proceedings .
Not everyone has a car , so public transport is needed in every country .
Public transport helps people to get to work on time and helps to reduce pollution .
Also , for low income families , who could n't afford to buy new cars , public transposition will help them to survive .
Public transport also reduces the daily traffic .
It helps people to keep on track in their schedule .
Hello , I like people and children and I like to play and have fun with children . It 's very cool .
I 'm a very happy person and very interested in cooking and all things about the kitchen . It 's cool . My dream job is cook .
Currently , I am in Syntagma square in Athens and it 's tremendously hot weather ! The sun is literally burning ! I 'm going to have a meeting with other international volunteers here in an hour .
I am looking forward to it like a small kid ! :)
I had the pleasure of visiting Hotel Sparta in Omonia square on my first day in Greece .
I spent last night at this hotel .
I am getting in touch with you to inform you that from November 1 different activities will be carried out in Caceres to attract numerous tourists from different places .
There will be leaflets , cartels at its disposal , in which it will be possible to find museums , churches , exhibitions .
Also , this year Caceres is the gastronomic capital . Therefore , they will find typical menus with products from Extremadura in its restaurants .
If there are any questions , do not hesitate to contact me .
Can we really confirm that there is no future for public transport ? If so , we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and going to the office , the city , or home and so on using private transport . However we should also think that in the centre there is no parking for cars or there is not enough for all private cars , so , if we use public transport , we can simplify our lives and spend less , simply because we are able to save money and time .
A comparison between people who like to use public transport and private transport shows that the former can save money and time but they are also much more relaxed than people who use private transport .
I hope that those people who wrote this article can change their thinking and can likely to write a very useful article .
I like volleyball because it is part of my life and of the life of my mother . It is my favorite sport , but I like other sports too , same I do n't play volleyball because I 'm bad , and my friends that I know , do n't like people who are bad at volei .
I'm watch them playing . They 're really very good , but when they play other schools , they 're very bad .
In the modern growing world , the basic needs of the general public are increasing day by day and their expectations of quality of life have taken on new dimensions .
When we were children , we used to use public transport for going from one place to another because that was the only cheap option available .
But today , things are changing and technology plays a significant role in our lives . The automobile industry increased its vertical and having a car has become a necessity rather than a luxury .
A car can help a person to go anywhere and at any time in much less time compared to public transport .
I believe that as soon as the automobile industry develops new technology in cars , people will be more keen to use their own vehicle instead of public transport .
The first reason is none other than the generation gap .
What is more , parents always consider their child the best .
Parents often compare their children to others , and this also plays a role in this case .
As far as I know , how to better understanding between parent and child .
According to the present situation , it is a pity that their relative influence happiness family .
Therefore it is important that we should think about this problem .
The sum up the above argument , we should take some measures and have a positive attitude .
On the one hand , we could take a communication forum . It could share everyone 's thoughts .
On the other hand , we should stand in other point and think about their reasons .
Only by talking about your opinions with your parents can you prove all the problem .
All in all , if you were to do this , your parents would not blame you .
Wellness depends on three important factors : sport , nutrition and sleep .
The factor that we are talking about is sport .
Sport is very important for the health .
Sport increases our physical performance .
There are a lot of different types of sports but one of them is the most popular in the world : football .
Football is a simple sport where the players must kick the ball into the opponents ' goal . In this sport , you principally improve the leg muscles , but all your body moves .
However , football is very competitive .
All the states in the world have their own league .
The best three teams in the national league can take part in the champions league ( in Europe ) or Asian league ( in Asia ) and so on .
These days a lot of children wish to be professional players and they practise this sport all the time and everywhere to improve their technique .
However , a lot of them ca n't reach this goal for a lot of reasons : no money , height ( all teams require a tall player ) and so on .
Football is great fun and you can play it anywhere with anyone .
Football is a sport that group and fun a lot of nations .
For us ( Mainque and Lucia ) , computers can not replace humans , because they do n't have a brain and ca n't feel anything .
Computers do things that humans ca n't , or that are very difficult or take too much time .
Computers have to obey the orders of humans .
And it is going to be this way for all eternity .
Humans are the best ! ! ! !
The diagram shows the development from 1998 to 2014 .
2005 was a low , but it grew again .
In 1998 , you are able to see that it decreased slightly .
" The Exorcist " is one of the most exciting and astonishing thrillers that I have seen in my life .
The actors ' performances are sublime , and they make you feel afraid throughout the film .
The special effects are amazing .
One thing that I find interesting , is that this film is atemporal . I mean that you can watch it in any decade of your life , and it always seems like a contemporary film .
This confirms " The Exorcist " as a great film .
Nowadays , with the development of society , a large number of forests and wetlands are replaced by tower blocks and transport networks .
This will cause three problems for us humans and animals .
First and foremost , it can cause contamination of the environment , which can affect our health .
Through this comparison the author wants to show that the pagan spring festival may look like a celebration of Christian beliefs , but it is not .
At Easter time , the important thing is to consecrate Christian tradition . In contrast , the pagan spring festival does n't focus on consecration but rather on celebration .
My town takes care of the environment , because the people of my town try to plant as many trees and plants as they can .
The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or anywhere that is too polluted , so they try to keep the air at recommended levels . In the morning , a lot of people go on foot to work or to school , or ride a bike , or they take the bus .
People try to move local factories out of the country , where there is less air pollution , less smoke , fewer cars and more forests and plants .
Travelling by car is convenient , but for most people , public transport is very important and much needed .
Not all people can afford to make journeys by car . A car is easy and cozy also , but public transport is fair and is very affordable for all classes of people .
Public transport mainly means public bus . People used to travel long distances by public bus . It is possible to carry large numbers of people to different places by bus .
The coat of arms of the city of Rybinsk is a scarlet heraldic shield , over which - green with golden beach pier , for which the output is a black rampant bear holding in its left arm , on the left shoulder a golden ax , under two silver starlets .
I like to drive my moped , because I love speed , and it 's fun to go out and drive with your friends to a beach or maybe a BBQ party .
I drive a Z√ºndapp KS50 . It is an old moped from 1975 .

Why do cultural differences sometimes cause the division of a country ?
Recently , Scotland really has ' Hit the world ' because some of the Scotch have tried their best for the Scotland referendum .
Although I knew that there was some conflict between England and Scotland , the vote really shocked me .
However , just as I thought , more than 50 percent of Scots voted ' no ! ' , so Scotland did n't separate from the United Kingdom .
- It goes without saying that cars are much more convenient than late trains , but I can not agree with the overall statement , although I do abhor using public transport .
I have been travelling with both for years , and I reckon everyone ends up needing public transport one day or another .
As a grown - up now , I know full well how much more affordable public transport is , albeit less than before .
Dear Juan , we moved to London for the holidays in December , to a huge and beautiful house with a big garden , a garage and a tennis court .
Richard 's family lives opposite .
Richard 's parents are good neighbours .
They are doctors at a serious hospital .
He likes going out with friends and going to parties . Richard has got a tortoise called " Peny " .
In this area there are a lot of clothes shops and supermarkets , but there are n't any sports shops .
I 'm so happy with these holidays . I hope I meet good people and visit beautiful places .
The rapid advance of information technology and the development of Internet networks enable the evolution of banking activities at a comprehensive level .
The connectivity derived from the Internet provides an invaluable business tool for online banking .
It influences customer behavior relating to banking services .
The customers from traditional branch banking moving towards using electronic delivery channels like personal computers ( PC ) and mobile phones is the most fundamental change .
Compared with the past when we uses horses for transportation .
Did people have the same opinion that there was no future for transport , and we can only use horses ?
The reason why we have such improvement is that the technology and innovation have changed our life .
Cars replaced the horse , and even planes have replaced the cars for long distance transportation .
So I think there will be a future for public transportation , and this may be because of updated technologies .
My favourite sport is soccer , because it is the most popular sport in the world .
After school , my friends and I go to a park to play soccer . We play for two hours .
When they were in the hospital because Fernanda foodbone , they gave her some chicken soup with a ladle , so she could drink easily . She started feeling much better so they persuaded her mom and Daniela to leave Fernanda at their house so she could get some rest and so she could eat more chicken soup , because they wanted Fernanda to feel better .
Daniela 's mom and her returned to the park , to continued picking up the trash from the grass .
Later they went to see a grotesque stroke , after Fernanda , crying , called Daniela 's mom because she also felt bad with the chicken soup , and she wanted to know how soon they 'd returned to their house .
So Daniela 's mom and Daniela arrived home at 11:00pm . It was dark and they would n't be able to see Fernanda . An that time the lights were turned off , and they tried to put them on but the lights did n't turn on .
They went to sleep , and the next morning the light came on , and they saw Fernanda standing in front of them very tired of waiting for them , so she got angry with them and went to her room and she did n't come out of her room .
Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexing problem . So her mom told her that they came out of the park at 9:00pm . It was still late but not too late , so they were on the street and the police arrived because the police thought that she had a globe of wine , and her mother told the police that she did n't have alcohol or wine in her car , and the police did n't believe her and they took them to the police station so they could check her car , and after about 10 minutes , they told her that she did n't have anything . So they went from there to their house and it was late , so that 's the reason .
She had evaded the police before that , but she did n't have anything in the car .
When Fernanda came out of her room , she started looking in her mom 's wallet to see if she had anything about the police or something and she did n't have anything so she forgave her .
But Fernanda summoned up the courage to ask her if she was telling her any lies , and her mom told her that she promised that was n't a lie .
thanks a lot for your response .
Here is some information about us .
We are a married couple , both 32 years old , living at the moment in Flims in Kanton Graub√ºnden .
I am originally from Ukraine and lived from 2009 till last year in Germany , and Juan is from Colombia , and has been in Switzerland for 3 years .
We 're moving to Z√ºrich because of my husband 's job in the newly - opened hotel Kirchgasse , right on the corner from the apartment .
And I will start studying at the Belvoirpark hotel school , so we 'll want to rent the apartment for at least 3 years or even longer .
We 're looking for a nice new home , and so , we are very interested in keeping your place tidy and taking care of it as if it were our own .
If you 'd like , we could get references from our previous landlords .
I hope this information is enough for a start and we can have the possibility to meet you and introduce ourselves in person .
This week we are flexible and could come over from Thursday to Saturday , and only in the evening the days before .
Looking forward to hearing from you and wishing you a nice day .
If I told you to choose between travelling in a car or by bus , which one would you pick ?
A lot of people nowadays would take their own car , it 's easier and flexible .
But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going ? that 's because of people changing their minds . They started to like having their own way of travelling . Privacy is also an important reason . People need to have a private means of transportation .
That 's why there is no future for public transport .
I promised to learn math for the whole week .
But every time , I get trouble .
I know I have to learn , but to start learning is n't easy .
I do n't want to study , but there is no way out .
My favourite sport is football . The main reason why I like it is because , when I was younger , I played with my friends and we got together to play every day .
I remember those years and I would like my children to practise it when they are older . It is an interesting sport .
My favourite team in Spain is Real Madrid ; the best team .
If I were a football player , I would like to play in this team , but I think that it is very difficult , because only the best players get to do it .
Nowadays , I like to do other sports : tennis , basketball , ... but I prefer playing football with my mates on weekends , and then we drink some beers in the pub to celebrate the victory or the defeat .
These moments are very special and I hope to be able to enjoy them for many years .
Finally , I recommend this sport for children in order to have a healthy life , get together with their friends , and forget for alcohol and drugs for a while .
I love sports and I believe playing them is the best thing for having a good life .
I am here to write a composition about public transportation in Somalia , especially the capital city , Mogadishu , where there is little public transport compared to our neighboring countries . There is a scarcity of public transport and there is one type and model , which is the van , and very distracted roads , which may cause collateral damage .
Sometimes , passengers and drivers face risks and road blocks , which usually happen when the Somali government leaders are travelling across the city and even abroad .
So , having a good infrastructure helps a lot and constant peace and the people of Somalia will not suffer any more .
Hello friends , welcome to Puerto . Here we have a lot of shops .
We have a very nice shopping centre .
If you want , you can buy a lot of things there .
1 . Is it possible to go without a compression machine ?
Will we be able to compress ducts manually ?
2 . I 've noticed that the machine 's cost is higher than it was previously .
Please , send us the actual strip material price .
If we want to produce spiro ducts and other articles in the future .
Do we have to buy a special new machine ?
As for public transport , you can save fuel as well as reduce pollution , but it takes more time to reach the destination ,
while if you have your own conveyance , you can save time and , moreover , it is safe .
The most important thing is , there would be heavy traffic on the roads and the traffic would move very slowly .
But keeping in view of the environment , we should choose to use public transport .

It is a clean and environmentally friendly city .
The city has its own public transportation system and waste management system .
People who live here take care of the city 's environment , so the city is a clean and green place .
The city contains about thirty public parks .
The parks are full of greenery ; these parks are also used as playgrounds for children .
Trees in the parks are not sufficient according to the requirements of our city .
Ten year ago , the local governing body of the city decided to plant more trees and it asked advice from the citizens of the city about the proposal .
We planted trees near the side of highways , unused land , and outside of the city .
Now these trees are grown up .
It give shade , shelter to animals , and purifies the air .
The trees also stop soil erosion in the rainy season .
Our city has a well equipped waste management system .
Each house in the city has two types of dustbin to keep recyclable and non - recyclable items separate .
In the morning , a waste collection truck comes and it takes this waste away .
These waste materials are processed in an environmentally friendly way .
The last film I saw was not new , in fact it was " The Others " .
" The Others " is a film that is about a family that lives in a house and in this house many strange things happen .
The principal character is Grace , who is the mother of her two children , Nicholas and Anne .
The husband of Grace is called Charles .
In the film , there were servants . They were Bertha Mills , Mr Tuttle and Lydia .
Charles has to go to the war and Grace and her sons stay in that house , but they are not alone . They are with Bertha Mills , Mr Tuttle and Lydia .
The problem is that the mother started to hear many weird noises and her sons were not making them , so who was responsible ?
Her sons have a problem which means that they ca n't look at natural light , and one day , Grace got up because her children were shouting and crying . So she went to their bedroom and the curtains were not there . So she went to the other room and the curtains also were not there . So she starts getting more and more nervous . She goes and talks to the servants , and she gets very angry and she tells them to get out of her house and they do not care so she picks up a gun and the old lady returns her keys .
Then many things happen , and then they discover that the servants were not the ghosts .
Of course I recommend this movie , because it is very interesting and in some parts it is funny too , and Nicole is the principal character , so I love it !
I do not agree with what journalists do , because , to me , if I were a movie star , a famous man who had done many performances , I would not like to be pursued by journalists every hour of the day .
In addition , everyone wants to have a moment of privacy and because of journalists , paparazzi , they can not have a moment to relax , tutoring for children or dependent on what else you want to do , and you can not because of journalists .
And another reason why I am so right in what I said in the lines above is that you feel as if you are in a game then people are always these people and destroy families because they declare false intrigue sometimes .
Sometimes they abuse the right to be a journalist with all sorts of questions , with no response , or have a partial response to these famous people can say that journalists have a stressful job for some people .
And finally , I would like to say yes , I am against these people , or they might still change their style and everything would be OK !

Hello Pierre ,
I would like to thank you for helping me .
You sent me a lot of information , but the most important was about the culture .
My teacher said that I have done a fantastic project .
Nowadays , the number of endangered species has increased .
Aactivist of animals rights claim that the reason is keeping animals in zoos .
But a lot of people say that a zoo can protect endangered species from illegal poachers .
So what should we do about that problem ?
To sum up , there are a lot of clearly strong arguments against keeping animals in zoos .
In my opinion , people should build some kinds of wildlife parks . This solution will allow
It 's a really expensive solution , but we must do that for
our future generations .
My town is called Assuit . The People here have no knowledge of how to deal with their rubbish . people throw their rubbish everywhere . On the other hand , we haven't any kind of law that can limit that action . I mean rubbish throwing .
So , if we still do n't do anything new , our country will still be unattractive .
Humans prefer a luxurious life .
With the coming of cars , people use public transport more rarely .
Everyone prefers to have his / her own car , so the future of public transport is very dark .
This is an alarming issue that needs to be addressed as soon as possible .
Because if everyone uses his / her car , pollution will increase and that will eventually affect every living being .
There we can eat many types of dishes , but the most popular dishes are " costela " and " bacalhau na brasa " .
The restaurant is very well situated with a big car park and beautiful landscaping .
As you enter the place , you are welcomed by a magnificent setting , a lot of photographs of the restaurant 's story and you have a wonderful view of the kitchen where you can see the chefs working , so you can see the quality of the food .
The chefs take great care in selecting the best quality ingredients and the service is great .
Clients do n't have to wait a long time until the dish is ready . While clients are waiting , they always give them bread and wine .
The price of the food is expensive , but nothing pays a good meal .
At the end of the meal , you have to sign a book to recall in the future .
I am interested in working on your summer camp program .
I am a suitable person for the job because I like to take care of kids and I have the ability to be empathic with other people .
I have good abilities , such as , organizing activities and helping the kids to keep their rooms tidy .
The charts below give information about the most important reasons for studying among students of different age groups and the amount of support they received from employers .
The first chart is the reasons for studying according to age of student .
For career has 80% ; under 26 years old students selected it . For the over 49 years olds , only 20% of people selected it ; but if you compare this with interest , it is totally different ; under 26 years old have only 10% ; but over 49 years olds have 70% .
The other chart is about employer support . Under 26 years old is the highest because it is almost 70% , the second highest is aged 26 - 29 years old ; it has 50% ; the lowerst is 35% and the age of the group is 30 - 39 years old .
The best places for young people to visit in Sweden is Stockholm city and a few more places that can be exiting .
In Stockholm you can do whatever you want . There are places for everyone to enjoy .
You can visit the old city and see old buildings and the castle , you can see the beautiful view from bridges over the water .
Young people might like to take a walk in king garden , where there are sakura trees .
If you like night life , you can go to some bars and night clubs that are open till morning .
But there are two places that I meant at the beginning . They are a big zoo called Kolmorden and the biggest aquapark in Scandinavia , which is called Rusha .
Dear head teacher ,
As a student at a local school , I would like to say that to cancelling the field trips
is n't good for students .
First of all , by getting students out of the classroom , students take a break from the school routine .
Furthermore , going on field trips gives students a chance to try things for themselves .
In addition , field trips are an important part of our school activities .
This is why I believe that field trips are good for kids .
Spyro in Kalithea .
Unfortunately , I saw you last many days ago .
Do you know I came back from Budapest ?
You know I was there on a trip .
As you can imagine , I visited a lot of monuments and cathedrals which I could see and find out something new about them .
As I discovered , the river Danube is the loveliest of rivers .
It 's even the longest river I ever saw .
And you ?
Write to me about what you were doing there .
I have been an architect since 2003 .
San Sebastian is a town near the sea .
When I was eighteen years old , I left home .
I lived in a hall of residence for two years .
After that , I lived in a flat .
My flatmate is my best friend today .
She is Azucena , and nowadays , she lives in Toulouse .
My husband and me often go to Toulouse to visit Azucena .
If Azucena did not live there , we would not know Toulouse .
I like Toulouse very much .
It is an old city with red buildings .
Toulouse buildings are built with bricks . Red bricks .
The river in Toulouse is the Garona .
Hello Alison ,
How are you doing ?
Susan told me that you need to know a couple of things before your visit to Spain .
We have customs , such as siesta , Semana Santa and San Ferm√≠nes in Pamplona .
We usually eat home - made food .
It 's what we call the Mediterranean diet .
It includes vegetables , meat , fish and olive oil .
In our daily life we wake up early in the morning .
Please drop me a line as soon as you can .
At that moment , he knew his decision was going to affect his whole life .
He thought about how he could solve his problem and finally he decided to break out .
When he was escaping from the prison , he bumped into an old friend callled Charlie .
Charlie was the only man that could help him escape .
Why do I enjoy my favourite sport ?
So , I think my favorite sport is going walking in the countryside .
I love it when the temperature is a little bit cold , but not too much .
I can relax when I walk alone and hear the sounds of the birds in the trees .
I live in a little village near a forest , so I can go walking through it every day .
There are so many animals and when you are quiet , you can see a deer or a fox .
And sometimes I take my camera with me , because I love photography and there are so many great motifs .
Restaurant .
We all agree on that . Eating food is one of the best moments in our day , it 's like the world stops for a few minutes in which you are just enjoying your food .
But there 's a difference between eating a good meal , and eating by the way .
In this opportunity I 'm going to talk about different cool restaurants we could choose for going out at the end of classes .
Michael decided to open the door and go back to her . He thought better the things he did not want to leave her again . He liked her . He knows himself and he wants to know her . He has kept all his feelings hidden for a long time .
What was the reason ?
The reason is , three days ago , he had been working when a girl at his work asked him whether he had a girlfriend and he said " I had one , come on , you know my ex - girlfriend " , then she just walked away without saying anything .
It was strange to Michael .
He remembered two years ago when he had been working and he decided to return home early . While he was on his way home , he saw his girlfriend with another guy . They were hugging .
He arrived home and he just thought and thought all night . It was the second time that she had been unfaithful . Since then , he has been alone .
This morning , he had not gone to work and he was sitting in a pub drinking beer , when a girl came to him . He knew her , she was Abigail .
This girl was an acquaintance of his .
They were talking about their lives and he remembered how he met her on the bus . Maybe she had always been the woman of his life . He looked at her eyes and smile he wanted to ask her whether if it was not too late to start to get to know her . But he decided to leave the pub . He walked to the exit .
Finally , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year , because Norovirus infected me ! At first , I had a high fever , but I thought if I took some medicine I would be fine .
I could n't eat anything , even on New Year 's Eve and I was so tired that I could n't play poker with my cousins .
Though everything was depressing , I still had a wonderful winter vacation with my family . We went to Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(‰πùÊóè ) to visit its blooming cherry blossom . ( I do n't know its variety ~ is it from Japan??XD ) The cherry blossom was very beautiful but there were so many people .
When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car , the wind was so strong ! I felt a little nervous though the scenery was amazing .
All in all , I still had a memorable vacation .
I tried that new programme on the internet for English learners called Write and Improve from Cambridge English .
I liked the way the page tells you your progress and marks your mistakes so you can fix them .
We will review their performance in 6 months and , accordingly , will decide on any upward / downward revision in their salary .
The company also reserves its right to discontinue the incentive amount if their performance is not found to be as per the job description .
There are some images of my family on the wall .
There is a coffee table made of wood with a clear glass top .
Also , on the sofas there are many colorful cushions .
There is a bookcase next to the rocking chair and when I have free time I sit on it and read a book .
There are three sofas around the coffee table and it is so comfortable .
When I want to study for exams , I go to the living room and sit in front of the TV .
In addition , there is a small blackboard for my little brother because my mother wants my brother to learn Arabic and English letters .
There is a small gray carpet under the coffee table and it protects things from breakage .
For this reason , I spend most of my time there .
It is very common that the bad economy of some countries forces their people to emigrate to another country .
When this phenomenon occurs , most of the migrants need to learn the new language to adapt to the new environment .
As a consequence , they forget their first language .
Another important point is the necessity of approval by some indigenous groups or people that emigrate from the countryside to the city in order to get a better lifestyle .
It is not a surprise that this situation is something that is becoming more frequent every day .
Public transport will be worse in the future than travelling by car because it is uncomfortable and slow .
In Spain many people will travel in their own car or by car with their colleagues or friends . This mode of transport is quick , but it is much more expensive .
If you travel with other people it is as expensive as public transport .
In my opinion , by sharing a car we will arrive at work on time and when we finish work we can go directly home .
The apartments in the cities are much more expensive and people prefer to travel in their car .
People who need to go in the same direction meet each other and use only one car .
This is convenient in terms of the cost of travelling , because every cost is divided between the participants and it is an opportunity to meet other people .
My country is a very interesting place . We have a lot of ancient and mystical places .
You can travel to Samarkand , Bukhara , Khiva and other historical cities .
Our national foods are really delicious .
I think you could n't work in my country , because it 's illegal for foreigners .
Thanks for your letter .
We meet near a fast food restaurant and after that we decide where to go .
In the city centre we can go to other shopping centers such as : " Passage " , Europe " , " Scorpion " . Last weekend we visited Passage .
At this shopping center I bought a new blue skirt .
After that , we went to our favorite art - cafe .
We like it because the cafe has a beautiful design and tasty food . After that , we went for a walk on embankment .
Hope . Hope to hear from you soon !
All the best ,
First of all , thank you professor for teaching me in the meantime . The entire course really benefited me , especially at the first meeting , about British English . I still did not really understand , it makes me frustrated , but gradually , later I found the beauty of the language in British English . I think it 's all because of the usual problem of American English , and so I really appreciate that you choose simple textbooks and it 's easy to learn , and you are really very careful and very humorous . You 're always careful in pronunciation correction for each student , and using a variety of reading skills lets us immerse ourselves in reading .
I love to listen to British English , but it 's really hard to study , because we all learn American English in Taiwan , so when I have the opportunity to in be contact with British English , it 's full - of - tone cadence always feels particularly charming , and British culture exudes noble temperament , so the British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance .
And the strengths and weaknesses of both segmental and suprasegmental , I think it 's maybe the learning habit . When I hear sentences , I use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again . Therefore , I can easily interpret illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings .
Only possible in segmental pronunciation , the occasional missed a few notes , such as -d , I did not notice this because when I deliberately stressed -d , I found the tone and mood more likely to become very weird . This is the biggest problem I 've encountered in pronunciation teaching .
I 'm not teaching English in my new school , but in the future , if there is the chance , I will definitely give it a try . especially in the curriculum learned some teaching tips , the biggest gain this course is to read picture books to read and record , because that and English proficiency is not just training , but will note that strengthen their pronunciation and intonation , and then each time peer feedback also completed the listening exercises .
If I have an opportunity to go back to teaching English , I think I will try this skill to get my students to do the recordings heard training , then make their English better and better .
It is situated inland .
The first stop for most visitors is the church because the local people clean and take care of it .
The town hall put containers for trash in the streets and the workers from the town hall clean the streets .
Besides this , everybody cleans their doors to keep them tidy .
What 's more , all the people , once a year , plant trees all over the village so that it is more beautiful .
To begin with , nowadays more and more people prefer travelling by car rather than by bus or train .
Certainly , it is more comfortable to travel in your own transport with your family or your friends . You can stop and have a rest wherever you want .
You can change your plans and choose another route .
To differentiate between old computers and computers today , we would first have to describe each type of machine .
I start by describing the old computers which we saw in the video , which were a few simple machines ( at the time they were created ) and they filled an enormous room .
On top of that , these machines only worked when you wrote an order to the computer .
These were experimental models .
Visually , the colors on the screen were black and green .
Currently , in the 21st century , computers have had a very long technology advance which range from the software and the size of the internal memory ( bigger than old computers ) , the size of the computer ( which is varied , but smaller than the computers of the past ) and their shape , the weight of them ( they are more lightweight ) and variations in the colors of the screen ( visually ) .
Finally , I can say that with the passage of time we change the way we see the world , evolution comes into play , not only of technology , but also of society , religion , etc . ,
essential in the life of people , but sow will be factors that humans will not be able to modify and it is better to let them continue as they are .
Sometimes famous people want to be alone without any journalists .
In my opinion , being alone means that you have something to think about , for example , to think about our deeds .
Journalists follow you and they do n't allow you to live like normal people .
To be on my own and watch other people live .
I always wear a mask , I can be myself only with my close relatives and friends .
In the end , I want to tell you that we are not robots . Everyone deserves what they want .
My opinion is the opposite of the one expressed in this composition title .
I do n't have a car .
Every day I take public transport .
I live in a city , and for many people like me , the most convenient transport is public transport .
There is heavy traffic and difficulty finding a parking space .
Every day , the population spends a lot of time in traffic congestion .
It 's a very good way to travel in the city .
One problem with cars is the high price of fuel .
I like public transport and I love my planet . I think the best method for reducing pollution
is to use public transport .
But that 's only my personal opinion .
Today I will talk about my summer camp job . People of all ages need to work in summer camps . My name is Patrick . I am 13 years old .
I would love to work in the summer camp to do exercise . Every shop in the USA should do the summer camp job . I am the right person to work there because I 'm very fit and I would love to work in the kitchen , because I am the right chef for the summer camp job .
I would be really very proud to work with you . You will see my wonderful lunch and dessert . Please give me this job .
A representative to carry out an investigation so that the town takes care of the environment .
One thousand people of eighteen years and over were questioned in my town about their ways of taking
The investigation reveals that youngsters are more than ever power to
announced the way they take care of the town .
In addition , the investigation can bring within company in
There is a service representative whose occupied the rubbish shared planning of day .
According to the enquiry , a representative works with a recycling company .
There are services which can clean and pick up the rubbish every day .
It 's on the second floor .
It has three bedrooms , and it has two living rooms .
Also , it has a spacious kitchen .
In addition , it has a nice and three bathrooms .
My apartment is very beautiful .
About 500 meters to AL - Salam Mall .
It has some disadvantages like , it hasn't a private parking lot .
Also , the street where it is has a lot of traffic .
In addition to that , it hasn't got a driver room .
Finally , my apartment is very beautiful , and it has a lot more advantages than its disadvantages .
There are various kinds of different things that happen in people 's lives , some may be normal and nothing special , while others may be so meaningful and unforgettable that you will remember them for a long time .
Have you ever had this kind of experience ?
When I was in elementary school , I took part in a speaking contest , but I failed , and I was broken - hearted .
But soon I made up my mind , thinking that I could n't be so decadent forever . I wanted some change , hoping I would be better the next year .
No matter whether it was sunny or rainy , windy or warm . And I also asked my teacher for help .
Eventually , I was third in the contest .
Through this time , I learnt that winning and losing are not the most significant thing .
The most important thing is that you can learn a valuable lesson from failure .
Resolve/ determine / insistence
My country has witnessed a tremendous change in the last ten years .
10 years ago , I was a child , and I could seldom eat meat for dinner .
But now , I feel uncomfortable without food every day .
Nowadays , young people 's health is n't as good as , for example , twenty years ago .
One reason for the change may be due to the lifestyle that people have .
Currently we usually do less exercise than before , because we use our cars to go everywhere .
Whereas our style of food has changed a lot .
We do n't eat at home and it 's very common to eat junk food every week .
On the other hand , children are used to eating only what they want , because in general , they do n't like legumes , vegetables , fruit , fish ...
They like eating junk food , hamburgers , French fries and sweets and , what 's more , they do n't do any exercise .
All these things could be very bad for their health in the future .
So it 's very important to give them a healthy upbringing .
To sum up , it is very important to be conscious of how food affects our health .
That 's the reason why we have to do more exercise , eat less fat and more vegetables , and teach our children to eat better and healthier than they are used to doing .
My opinion of self - employment
I never ever wanted to be self - employed .
My dad and my grandfather ran their own business for more than 20 years .
My mother always told me that my dad never had time for her and my siblings .
When I was born , my dad decided to quit his company to get more time for his family .
Nowadays , the number of car owners has been increasing in many countries , especially in developed countries , due to the convenience of travelling by car .
Thus , some people claim that the social trend tends to reduce the popularity of travelling by public transport .
Today , private vehicles have become the pride of people 's lives , which means if a person is in their private vehicle , they look as though they have a higher status in society .
So it has become a fashion to use private vehicles , which creates a lot of problems . A big one is the traffic problem .....
Now the traffic problem is the biggest problem . The only solution to this using the public transport system as much as possible .
But now using public transport is seen as something for people of low status , so there is no future for public transport .
To tackle this problem , we have to carefully think about it .
Thank you very much .
Our life keeps changing every day and we notice a huge range of changes in each decades .
The lifestyle , technological equipment and the design of cars and houses keep changing annually .
We can accept that our life will be quite different from now in fifty years .
Changing is a natural habit that makes life more enjoyable for us .
It brings happiness and beauty to us .
For example , we can know the type of a car model by the changes that are made to it , which makes you idiotif the small new details in every model .
Even the kind of house painting can be changed over time .
Now it is more colorful and designed in different ways than it was in the past .
We can not stop changing , but we can guide changes to provide special benefit which makes life easier and more comfortable .
Using the changing method would improve the education system in many ways , especially for people with obstruction .
It brings hope to their lives and makes them taste life in a way that they had never dreamed of .
In conclusion , the changing of our life can help us to explore different benefits of changing every decade .
It service the education and entertainment aspects of our lives .
The ecological problems have been very bad for the last few years .
The enormous number of cars and the traffic jams cause pollution of the air and smog .
But there is active construction of new roads , road junctions and improving of roads .
But people are interested in it and this year I saw announcements about days for receiving separate rubbish .
Our lawns are also a problem .
I enjoy watching tennis on my couch . It is n't weird that I haven't played tennis , because where I live we do n't have that kind of sport , so I can only watch on my TV .
But I hope one day to go to a tournament , travel to Spain and watch my favourite player , who is Rafael Nadal from Spain .
The first time I watched him play eight years ago was the same year that I started watching tennis .
I like how the players move around the court and how the audience applauds them every time they win a point . Although I 'm not on the court , I can feel the feeling of the game . It 's really awesome .
Once in a while , I enjoy watching tennis when there is a competition or tournament , besides watching and enjoying it , I can also learn how real the game is , what its rules were or what happens when they yell at the umpire for no reason . You can learn all these details and wait for a future day to put them into practice , or helping the players is one of the things that I want to make real .
My advice would be that if you want to play tennis , you should just go ahead and play it , not wait till others do it , because you can do that too .
At the beginning , it could be a little hard , but that is the same with many other sports when you start , so just keep in mind that you could play tennis with the most talented players from all over the world .
But , what about sharing a ride ?
Riding a horse is an old - fashioned way but still interesting .
Public transportation is excellent ; you save money , take care of the environment and make friends .
Nowadays , Easter is associated more with spring 's arrival than with religious rituals .
People are more likely to take care of the gardening or shopping than participate in the celebration of Good Friday , which makes the author connect Easter with a pagan spring festival .
Flamengo was champion in 2009 . In 2009 Flamengo had a great team with good players , but now it is struggling to finish the competition in the first 4 teams of the championship .
My mouth is dry and has an awful metal taste , my head aches , it 's still spinning slightly and there is a terrible ringing in my ears .
It must be the aftereffect of whatever those clowns in masks have done to me . I want to shut down all the noises around me , especially those whispered shouts coming from behind .
My best friend has always been like a sister to me .
Our mums went to high school together , although they never talked a lot .
The first time I met her , she insulted me , but I just did n't pay attention to what she had said to me .
It was in school , when we were only three years old !
Despite that , we started to talk more and more , until we were what we are nowadays .
She always helps me with whatever I need , and she 's amazing .
She 's always happy and laughing , and never gets angry when I get agitated !
She 's incredible ; she is like the sister I never had .
On the other hand , she has never been a talkative girl , so it 's usually me who is always talking a lot .
Even so , now she is starting to talk more often , and when we started high school we made lots of new friends !
I could n't imagine a life without her . She 's the best person I ever met .
My town is located along the middle coast of Vietnam .
It is a really beautiful place and has a lot of attractions scenery , such as the great beaches beside rows of trees , the obviously regularly weather ... Therefore , taking care of the environment there is a vitally important mission of my town 's state .
When receiving an alarm about the pollution of water or land ... by the town 's inhabitants , the authorities must reposibile for this cause .
They often notify all the town 's citizens about spending a free day on clearing all the rubbish on the beach and on the roads of the town .
Then , they will gather all the rubbish in one place and burn or bury it .
Finally , the government usually encourages on the radio , television etc .
It means that tourists and the people of the town have a crucial duty to protect the beach , the roads etc .
On weekends , I usually wear clothes according to the weather .
If it is very cold outside , I put a jacket on , but if it is very hot , I wear shorts , sandals , a lighweight vest and sunglasses .
Sometimes , when I have to dress well , I wear dressy stuff , such as skirts , dresses , high heels and a sort of classy hairstyle .
When I stay at home , I can wear pyjamas all day long ( for example , when I 'm sick ) . Also , there are days when I want to go to the beach with my family , and so I put my bikini and a summer dress on .
In your message , you said that you needed to find a famous person in my country and needed some suggestions from me .
I would like to recommend a famous person who 's name is Mr. Chou .
Mr. Chou is a famous doctor in my country .
He started the hospital system in my country .
Best regards , and look forward to your reply .
In modern life , we rely on transport to get to work or travel everywhere .
It is convenient to travel by private car everyone can afford it , so that everyone has a private car nowadays . Some people suggest private cars are going to replace public transport .
I ca n't agree with this point of view for the reasons below .
Firstly , the growing number of private cars causes a big problem with traffic jams . People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam .
That wastes people 's time and makes people feel exhausted .
Not to mention , it 's definitely hard to enjoy travelling on holidays .
Secondly , private cars are the main reason for air pollution . We should consider the protection of the environment for the future of humanity , not only care about the convenience we can see for now .
On the other hand , public transport systems can reduce the number of private cars in the busy areas , for example , buses and trams .
For instance , Melbourn , the second city in Australia , where there are trams through the whole city area .
Therefore people do n't need to drive cars to travel in the city .
The last point is that people go for long journeys by public transport .
Public transport brings relaxing holidays and efficient business trips for people without being weary after a long drive .
For these reasons , it is unlikely there is no future for public transport .
On the contrary , we need more public transport to improve our traffic system and find a better way to protect the environment .
Alison read the note and it said " I 'll be back at 8 pm " .
It was 11 pm and her boyfriend was n't in their house . She started getting confused and temerously .
After waiting for 20 minutes , she decided to call the police ; they said " wait for the morning , maybe he went somewhere , we ca n't help you now " .
After that answer , she was n't satisfied , so she decided to start calling all the hospitals in the area .
it was 4 am and she had no answer .
Alison felt desperate . She noticed that her husband 's car keys were in her house , so he was walking or someone had picked him up . She picked up the phone and she called all his group of friends . Nobody knew anything and now they were scared .
She was terrified . She started thinking about the possibility of death .
She got into her car and looked for her husband all over their small city , Pentonville . After half an hour , she saw him sleeping in a square .
George had lost his memory , and he could n't come back .
Nowadays , they are living a happy life and every day Alison has to make him remember their life .
Nowadays , there are many types of transport in the world : bus , taxi , train but train more conform then else . I always use the bus in the city .
If you to travel from city to city , public transport is cheaper than other modes of transport .
My favorite sport is football .
In my opinion , if you want to start to do this sport you could write a team . Moreover , I think that it is good because it could help you to lose weight .
The statement " public transport is our future " has been an interesting political discussion for years .
On one hand , public transport is good because it does n't pollute so much and you can move around the whole city .
We do n't use so much petrol as if each passenger were to use their own private transport .
But in fact , you ca n't use it if you have to carry a lot of things or when you are in a hurry .
In conclusion , public transport is very good and if it disappears it will be a big problem . It is true that sometimes you need private transport , but apart from that , public transport is used a lot by people of all ages .
Transportation is very important in cities and villages as well as in sub - lines .
Many . Many people have no vehicles , they only depend on public transport for some reasons .
Any Anyway , in some cases , a car is very useful to reach the destination very fast .
Public transport provides all the information about routes they follow and give an idea to passengers about the place .
Some Sometimes it may be very expensive due the fares .
I 'm a committed , responsible , and organized person .
I like new challenges to improve myself .
I think that I have enough experience for the job .
My skills and accomplishments speak for me , because I 'm qualified for this job , I have the requirements that are requested to apply to work here .
If you choose me , I comitted with myself to comply with everything , working in a timely manner , because that is how I am .
The most important thing for me is to have more work experience and surpass my achievements that I gained long ago .
First I would like to introduce myself . My name is Joaqu√≠n Guti√©rrez and I want to tell you why my favourite sport is football , which is a sport that I have practiced since I was six years old .
I like this sport very much because it must be played with a group of people and is more fun than other sports which you play alone with one other opponent , like tennis .
I must confess that , the first time , I did n't like it very much , because I was a bit shy and It took a lot of effort to integrate with the other players in the team . But with the passage of time , I liked it more and more .
Currently , I play in the first division of the club River PLate from Argentina .
I would like to advise children who are taking their first steps in this sport , that it is with perseverance and effort that you can achieve great treasures .
In the past , I did some exercise .
I have swum in a swimming pool and I have also cycled on my bicycle .
I also went to the mountains with my family .
I always went to school on foot .
Last year I gave some of my sister 's dolls to a charity .
Now , this year , I 'll do more exercise . I'll go with my family to the beach and swim in the sea .
I 'll eat better . I'll walk more . I'll do good things and speak more with my friends .
Have you heard about Islam ?
What are your media sources or what ?
Can you ask yourself why we are here on earth . To entertain or for what ?
Be honest with yourself .
First , I would like to tell you that I do not agree with this statement . I could even say that this opinion is the opposite of the present and future situation .
As for me , even if travelling by car is so much more convenient , most people will always travel by train , railway , bus and other types of public transport .
In my opinion , people will travel by public transport more frequently , because this type of transport is less expensive , more reliable and even more environmentally friendly than travelling by car .
On the other hand , we can say that it is really uncomfortable to travel by public transport , but can improve even this in the future .
We can discover new ways of travelling , take more care of our public transport and modernise it , so people will be motivated to travel on it .
My trust in future technology is so enormous that I hope there will be new environmentally friendly and cheaper ways to travel around our world .
If this happens , people will be more social and empatic , not only about people 's emotions , but also about our environment , and they will treasure it .
To begin with , there are two ways of cutting down on pollution which leads to global warming , which has become a real threat to our lives day by day .
To illustrate this , when we use renewable energy , we reduce emissions , so , our natural resources will be conserved for our future and our children 's future .
For example , by using wind energy or solar energy for electricity generation , we will use less fuel , which is implicated in emissions .
Secondly , we should improve our regulations that impose rules on people to reduce the use of things that cause a lot of pollution such as using big vehicles or building big facilities such as big factories .
As a result , ways to cut down on pollution . For instance , when one person uses a car for 6 people and many people do the same , that causes a lot of pollution . Because of that , we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars to cut down on pollution for a better future .
All in all , using renewable energy and improving our regulations are two ways to cut down on pollution for a better future .
Another thing we can do for a better future is avoiding war .
Because war destroys mankind and countries .
Many wars start because people do n't know or respect other beliefs very well . Thus , we need to learn about other people 's beliefs if we are to live with them .
For example , the fight between Muslims and Hindus in India or in the Lebanese civil war .
For example , people should cooperate in intervening to bring peace to the world , to stop war in many areas like the United Nations is doing .
For example , the United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . In brief , knowing each other and more cooperation between countries are two ways to avoid war for a better future .
For that we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars to cut down on pollution for a better future .
All in all , using renewable energy and improving our regulations are two ways to cut down on pollution for a better future .
My most terrifying day was January 23rd last year .
I was at school : while I was listening to the English lesson I felt a severe headache .
After ten minutes , I asked the teacher to call my parents so I could go home .
At home , my dad and I had lunch , but my headache did n't stop .
At 2 p.m. my mum decided to go to the hospital because I could n't understand anything and I could n't talk .
At the hospital , the doctor put me on a drip and after some hours I felt better .
I wo n't ever forget that day !
Currently , a very significant problem for its social and economic impact is the chaotic public transport in Lima .
To solve this problem , Lima has been making long - term strategies .
Lima is one of the cities with the least road culture in the world .
We do not respect traffic rules and drive only with the intention of going as fast as possible to our destination . This often causes traffic accidents and congestion .
For this reason , people are becoming aware of the terrible problem and are learning and teaching vial culture to new generations .
In addition , public institutions are promoting this and also private companies create advertising to increase awareness .
Lima is among the top ten cities that have the messiest public transport in the world .
This is due to the fact that Lima , in the beginning , did not have a plan to design its public roads and highways , and it has only been improvising to build them without any criteria to transport its population .
Currently , this issue is so important that governments are investing and working to create solutions , such a metro .
I think we have really become aware of the chaos of public transport and we have begun to design and implement strategies that , in 20 years , will improve our reality .
I believe public transport will have a future , because this transport is really necessary for people .
In all cities of the world , people will need public transport to get around the city .
People think that public transport is only the buses , but public transport is the buses , the taxis , trains and subway .
Maybe travelling by car is so much more convenient , but there are a lot of cars and those cars produce a lot of fumes and the natural world is dying . If we do nothing , the natural world will disappear .
I would like people to take public transport for travelling , so we will be able to rescue the countryside .
I usually take public transport to go to the University , because public transport is cheaper than a car .
I used to use my car every day , but little by little , I started to take public transport so that I could save money .
With respect to the international dispute over the Diaoyutai Islands , the Republic of China should consistently express willingness to resolve the issue in a peaceful manner in line with the principles of the UN Charter and international law .
To this end , it proposed the East China Sea Peace Initiative in 2013 , which called upon all parties concerned to take the steps outlined below :
( 5 ) establish a mechanism in collaboratively exploring and developing resources in the East China Sea .
He imagined he could fly like a dragon .
As he jumped down the stairs , wings flapping across Cairo .
He flew to Saudi Arabia .
Eventually , he saw the Kabaa .
As he got closer , he saw a lot of people around the Kabaa .
They were doing rites of pilgrimage .
One there , a man , raised his hands and called to God .
It was amazing .
He had never seen anything so fantastic . But all too soon , it was time to leave .
It had been a fun day out , but unfortunately he had to be home in time for bed .
After he had arrived at home , he fell asleep and he started to think of his next adventure ..........
My neighbourhood is a very pleasant area , it is quite big and it is so green .
The population is estimated at around ten thousand people .
My neighbourhood is surrounded by a large range of mountains which have scenic views .
We have got a large shopping centre with some local shops , you can get plenty of things that you want from it .
One of the most amazing things that will attract you , is that it has a safari , park which is the most enjoyable thing . At the same time , it introduces you to wildlife without your needing to go out of your city .
All the amenities that are necessary for your daily life , such as a fantastic school with perfect teachers and a modern building can be found here .
Transportation is not an issue , because it has got many bus lanes and bus stops .
It is not quiet and it is an active city in different ways .
If you like active cities with enormous activity , I think it is an excellent place .
My favourite sport is badminton and I always get up early to play it every day . I like it because it is the best way to lose weight and improve your health ; better than medicine .
I think people should get exercise by starting to play some favourite sport instead of watching TV or playing games .
The purpose of this proposal is to provide details about shopping facilities in my hometown , Vung Tau , and give some recommendations for tourists .
They have a long tradition dating back to the 18th century when Vungtau was a small commercial port .
Not only are they well - known for their long tradition , but they are also famous for the hospitality of the inhabitants living here , which attracts domestic and foreign tourists who come here to see the famous sights as well as shop for souvenirs .
They are located close to the local art gallery which takes about 15 minutes to go to on foot .
They offer a wide range of choices , from souvenir items such as pictures and jewellery to local specialities , at a reasonable price to suit the interests of different people .
You can buy them as a small present for your family members or friends .
I assure you that there should be high - quality and varied products there satisfying your needs .
It is conveniently situated in the town centre , which takes 5 minutes to walk to as the crow flies .
A lot of products , such as consumer electronics , foods , and souvenirs are sold here .
Compared with local shops , products ' prices in the shopping mall are considerably higher than those in local shops , but it offers a wider variety of products .
I highly recommend local shops to our tourists for their cheap prices and the hospitable manners of residents here .
My name is Yusuf Hamid . I am 17 years old and I attend the state secondary school in Sche√ülitz ,
To be more precise , I am in the graduating class .
I come from Hallstadt , in the close vicinity of Bamberg .
My hobbies are meeting Friends and hanging out with them or playing basketball in my spare time .
I 'm easily excited and nervous because this oral examination will determine whether I can do my A -level at the college of further education in Bamberg , which is what I really want .
My favourite sport is soccer .
It 's played by eleven players who try to score a goal within ninety minutes .
There is a grass surface , but it 's also played on artificial grass .
I really enjoy playing it because it 's very exciting because anything could happen .
I usually play it with my partners and my friends , which makes the game even more fun .
I highly recommend anyone to play soccer , because i 'm sure that they will enjoy it very much .
It 's also a complete sport because people will improve their health and fitness .
The first thing I want to say is that people use the car like a luxury object , not as a mode of transport .
People spend their first salary on buying a car .
So , normally , the use of a car is for pleasure .
People do n't use the five seats of the car to travel .
From the point of view of the environment , this is a bad idea , because it uses a lot of gas per person .
The cities are crowded and there is a lot of pollution from noise and exhaust .
A new problem is in the small towns , because they are not designed to accommodate a lot of cars .
I think that the main problem with public transport is the communications between villages and small towns , because they only exists between the big cities .
Some countries have a good communications network and people use then mainly because public transport is cheaper than the car and quicker .
It is a problem of mentality . If we had been born into a society that used public transport , I think that would be better and we would use it normally .
In my own town , people do n't use public transport . Some months ago , the council set up a public bike service and , three months later , they had to close it .
My name is Afsaneh . I 'm from IRAN . I came to London 4 months ago and I want to talk about the Iranian celebration of new year .
We have 3 special days during the celebration of our new year .
They are called :
It means Tuesday night of week and takes place on the last Tuesday night of the year . On this night , people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to the fire : I give you my sign of sickness ( yellow color ) and you give me your healthy sign ( red color ) and eat some special foods .
It means new day of the new year and takes place on 21 March ( first day of spring ) this day is very important for us because we clean our houses and buy new clothes just for new year . The major things on Norouz day is haft sin table and including the seven items which start with letters " s " .
We gather around the table on this day and wait for the spring in the last moments of the year .
When the new year starts , we hug and kiss , wishing each other happy new year and presents are exchanged .
During the holiday , people go to see their family , friends and relatives for a type of short visit .
It means thirteenth day of spring . On this day , people go on a picnic and spend the day out of their homes in nature because they believe that the number thirteen brings bad luck for them .
The television can entertain , and also educate people .
There are so many educational programs , like Animal Planet , and so many others .
Sometimes , some TV shows are so great that they help you in certain classes , for example , Animal Planet can help you in biology . The History Channel can help in history , etc ... In my opinion , television can be as good as books , and can also be a form of learning as good as only reading books , because TV is something fun , so you can learn and have fun at the same time .
Series can also help you to study . For me , it helped me a lot because I love series and some q I watch have helped me in school , such as Breaking Bad , which helped me in chemistry , and so many others .
Last year I saw a movie called ' ' Side by Side '' , and it talked a little about life in ancient history , and by coincidence I was doing this subject in school , so it helped me a lot .
In my opinion , television can entertain and it can educate people in different ways .
I am writing in response to your advertisment for SUMMER CAMPS .
I am very interested in the job , because I would like to work for you this summer .
I could start whenever you like .
I worked as an assistant chef in a Lagunak Restaurant last summer . I worked in another restaurant in London , but I would like to look after children , because I have studied to be a teacher .
Also , I have worked in other summer camps , which are Funny Camp , Nature Camp , etc .
I believe I am suitable for this job , because I enjoy working with children and I know how to cook very well .
Also , for me , the salary is not a problem , because my motivation is to learn .
Yours faithfully .
Everyone says that our lives are going to change in the future but that is what everyone says .
In the future , I really want my grandchildren to be happy . That is all I ask for . I may be young , but I think I do n't see myself living on earth in the next 50 years . I mean dreaming does not hurt .
I ask myself every day how can I survive in this mad world ?
I do not know how to answer this question honestly , but I guess I will never know .
I think that public transport has a great future because there are more people who use it every time .
However , I think it is very expensive , but with a decrease in the cost , there would be more people .
Nowadays , having a car is very expensive because you have to pay for a lot of things .
Public transport would have more of a future if it were better distributed .
Personally , I use public transport more and I hardly ever use private transport .
The transportation is practical because not all places are search , use cars , trucks and sometimes boats more .
The tourist will never be bored and will have a lot of time to visit the city .
Baja California 's weather is not as cold as Chihuahua 's .
When you go to the beach you have to cross a large avenue to get there on foot .
I have a very tiring day when I go and go straight to bed .
The last few days when I was in Baja California I got very little time for shopping and going to the beach .
Well , I think you have chosen the best idea , because there are
First , I believe you should travel from the north of Italy to the south , in
Finding a job in Italy is n't as easy as you think , because the
economic system is in crisis , so it 's hard even for Italians , thinking for
But that 's not all . Since you know two languages , maybe you could find
a summer job in a travel agency , because they need someone in
reception who can speak another language apart from Italian .
I will find someone who knows the agency 's manager , and you will
have sent me your CV after the weekend , because he will surely want it .
I 'm very glad to hear from you again ,
I think the car is more convenient than public transport .
In a car , you do not have a timetable to consider , you 're free to leave , to go home when you want ... not sit still in snow , rain , cold .
And without getting stuck in the city because of delays by drivers . On public transport there is the possibility that you 're standing for the whole trip , there is always a lot of people , it is cold in the winter and in the summer it 's too hot .
Trips are longer on public transport than by car ,
By reading the history , we can know that some disasters happened every year of Jaiwu .
There have been several serious natural or man - made disasters this year .
In Taiwan , a serious air crash caused by bad weather happened first .
Around the world , up to three air crashes which resulted from being hijacked or shot happened .
There were also conflicts between western countries and ISIS .
In my opinion , all of us should be careful with all the details when we deal with everything to prevent disasters .
Additionally , all human beings should stop fighting and devote themselves to pursuing a peaceful world .
Last but not least , we should do everything according to our conscience .
Frankly , it seems that the town that I have been living in has not taken care of the environment .
It is easy to see when we walk around or when we go for a walk .
In general , we do n't care about anything ; water , recyclable things , even our air conditioning .
This is such a chronic problem throughout my country .
Here in Brazil , it is very difficult care about it because it demands serious action and skills from our government , which unfortunately wo n't happen soon .
Although Brazil has gone through several changes in the last 40 years , the main one hasn't started yet , and I am talking about education .
Our government prefer to keep our population without information , because it is easier to manipulate their minds .
And why am I talking about it ? I am talking about it because the foundation of environmental protection is our mindset . Just with knowledge and information , we will be able to manage actions to save , protect and improve the environment , and instead we have the current result .
So , if we believe it is an important subject to care about , we need to move fast and our first step should be our election process .
This aphorism is famous and true .
People try to build big and luxurious houses but they forgot about the main thing .
It is warmth that is needful for us .
We can have a really good house where there is a lot of furniture , space and ornaments .
We can choose expensive things for the interior ,
but these things are not important if there is not a comfortable atmosphere .
We have to invest our love , dreams , patience , and as a result , we can create the best house ever .
Building our house we make the most important place for us .
So we have to follow our dreams and create a warm and cosy place .
In this report I am going to talk about how my town takes care of the environment .
First at all , I asked the council about this great problem which is pollution and the way to solve it .
He is aware that the increase in pollution is a big problem and that measures must be taken to try to solve it .
There is no easy way , but it is necessary to do it .
n the town , he tries to make people aware of the situation and they take care of the environment .
On the other hand , the question is whether this solution could be enough or not .
In my opinion , we should be conscientious and stop it . If we do n't stop it , after , it will be too late .
I love my family , we hardly ever argue !
For example : we go to the restaurant , we go to see my brother 's football matches , we eat or stay at home all together .
We sometimes give presents at parties , like birthday parties ...
The best present that I have received was ... I do n't remember !
Another thing , in my home there are some rules : my brother and I tidy our room , we clean the bathroom after we use it , we ca n't eat on the sofa .. .
I always try to obey the rules , but I sometimes break them because I 'm lazy !
I do n't argue with only one member of my family .. I sometimes argue with my brother about television channels , but we make up immediately .
With my parents , I argue about school , how I use my mobile phone , how I speak to them ..
My last argument with my family was yesterday .
I 'll talk about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , and Riyadh City in particular .
First , you should know about the weather . We have a very cold winter and a hot summer compared with the other countries in the Middle East .
Riyadh is the capital City . It 's in the center of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia .
All the stores and malls close at midnight , as well as for the five prayer breaks , because we need to go to pray . For work , you need to know what the field you want to work in , is so I can help you to search for a good job matching your abilities .
After what I have told you about my country , I hope you like it .
My village has around 700 residents .
It has a lot of beautiful things , like an old church from the 15th Century . This church is in ruins , but the new church is also very beautiful and comfortable .
My village has a wall of stone . This wall was built by residents of the village in 1715 .
Another interesting place in my village is the square with its spring .
Also , there are the supermarket , bar and restaurants .
For many years , people have used public transport to go to work , to study , and to travel .
So , we use trains , buses and bikes to get from place to place .
Let us examine the advantages and disadvantages
I think that public transport will have a future for many reasons .
A man could have some problems with his health .
For example , if man had a broken leg , it might be hard to drive a car .
Also , for some people , it could be cheaper to travel by bus , especially for a tourist from a foreign country .
Sometimes it is better to travel by bus because of thorny road .
The bus is a democratic form of transport , which is used by students , kids , adults , rich and poor people .
When you are travelling with a big company , it is the best decision to travel by bus .
This is because everyone has a place on the bus .
And it 's fun and exciting to travel with a group by bus .
Nowadays , people have a stressful life , so we ca n't spend time waiting for public transport .
We might think that there is no future for public transport , because most people use their own car .
Using your own car , you can take the decision of what timetable is more convenient and what route you are going to use .
It 's more comfortable to go anywhere in your own car . The problem is the pollution that this life brings us , and also the parking problems .
If everybody goes in their own car , they have to park and maybe the place is full .
Also , travelling by car is so much more convenient because you do n't have to stop in each town , so using your own car saves time .
Nowadays , people are really worried about their jobs due to the big financial crisis in which some people have lost their jobs and others are working in rubbish jobs for little money .
Because of all this , the question is too difficult to answer .
In my opinion , the most important is thing enjoying your work because we spend an average of nine hours in the office or in whatever work that we do . As a result , if you do n't feel comfortable , your life could be hell .
The truth is , that the ideal would be that all people could work in their dream jobs and , of course , make a lot of money , like for example , Hollywood actors or football players . But that is almost impossible .
In summary , for me , it is better to enjoy yourself at work every day , although you do not have a big salary .
The most important thing is to wake up each day with a big smile and work hard .
The Scorch Trials is one of the best films and thrillers that I have ever seen . It is so exciting to see all the thing that they do to survive in the outside world with all those people that are infected with a virus and the reason why they put them in the glade for them to be immune if some sick person bites them .
One of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel to go for them and take them again to the Cruel building , and like all of them , does n't want to go with them . They start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decides to go after them and he gives a great speech to all the people who go with them and help him to get back Mihno . And what I really want to see in the next film is whether Thomas is mad at Teresa ( I never liked her ) and if they get free and the world goes back to normal .
It is a beautiful place where people can go to have an excellent time and enjoy the forest and lagoons .
There are cabins where you can have a good time in front of a bonfire and sleep in a beautiful room made of ecological materials .
On the trip you can do many activities , like climbing , swimming , paddling , rafting and enjoying the place .
It is a beautiful place to go in your free time and get to know it .
I think I am the right person for this job because I have a lot of motivation and a good level of English .
I would also like to get this job because I love the USA and I often do babysitting , so the company of children does not frighten me .
When I was younger , I went to summer camp in France . Consequently , I know which activities I can propose to children .
I hope I have convinced you .
This subject is beautiful and incredible . like it very much .
I want to do this course every day if it 's possible also now .
I want your help .
Can you help me somehow ? Please . I want to study this subject .
The day began as usual and there were no signs of trouble , but when she woke up and went downstairs she saw a dog but the dog was an unusual color .
Usually her dog was a blue color but at that moment it was red
Recently , I saw Tarantino 's new film , Django Unchained , and I have to say that I am looking forward to watching the next one .
He took down every mistake he made his in last films .
Firstly , Django Unchained reminds us of the hard life suffered by black people in the past through a great introduction without dialogues , where black people were unchained while they came back to be sold to an owner farm . This was matched with an amazing soundtrack as identity Tarantino 's films .
Nowadays , in many countries , young people are looking for doing sports to be fit and very active and there are many sports to participate in .
On the one hand , there are some arguments for sport , especially volleyball .
When I play volleyball , I totally forget all my problems and focus on nothing but volleyball and the intensity of the game . This is a game I like to play .
In addition to this , it pushes me to keep on trying so that I can get everything right .
It 's all about willpower and the absolute desire to get better .
On the other hand , there are a lot of famous players of volleyball who have had knee ligament injuries .The most frequent cause of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone .
In addition to this , injuries were more frequent during games than during training .
In my opinion , volleyball must then be considered among high - risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings . My advice for someone who is starting this sport is that you will be refreshed after you play this game and it makes you do your work in a relaxed way .
I believe there are numerous possibilities for public transport because cars and public transport play completely different roles in our society .
First of all , public transport probably meets the needs of people who hardly use or do n't use their cars to travel .
In Japan , which has one of the largest populations over 60 , many senior citizens prefer using buses to cars .
In addition , a new generation is growing up and they do n't own their own cars because there are few opportunities to travel and because of the high cost of having a car of their own .
Second , public transport provides a quick and easy way to visit unfamiliar places .
It is not necessary for us to know in advance how to get to the destination when we are using public transport .
So it prevents us from having to open maps to confirm every single route .
When it comes to our environment , the use of public transport could be a solution for reducing the emission of CO2 .
For these reasons , I see a bright future for public transport .
It is beyond doubt the taking care of the environment is regarded as a turning point in our life .
It is upstream that irrigates our economic life , and there is no doubt that negligence has the ability to destroy many good aspects of our lives , and our government is doing its best to put an end to negligence ,
but we also must cooperate to save our town . On the one hand , we must Presentation an awareness program for all people ,
and we must not throw rubbish in the street to keep the area clean , and we must Maintain clean trees to keep the area attractive . Thus , we can improve the national income by attracting many people from other towns . And we must teach children that cleanliness is necessary for their health and at their school they should throw rubbish in the waste baskets and anyone who throws it on the ground will be punished . In conclusion , we ca n't do without cleanliness in our town .
The natural environment is being destroyed . That is a problem people focus on frequently .
Many countries build more and more buildings . This affects people 's quality of life .
Building more large buildings can destroy people 's and animals ' living environment and some animals may become extinct .
Governments should take some measures to deal with building more buildings . We will destroy the natural environment .
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
I do not agree with this statement because in big cities there are a lot of cars . If all the people in a city use their own car at the same time , there will be a huge traffic jam , so travelling by car is n't much more convenient in this situation .
There are more problems in big cities . One of them is parking . There are a lot of areas in a city where it is very difficult to park and you only have 2 options ; you can park in a private car park and pay a lot of money or you can waste your time searching for a parking space .
I want to talk about my favourite sport .
Have you ever heard of hockey ?
This is really my favourite sport .
And I am fond of a Russian team .
We are taking part in a championship this year .
And I am glad to win a championship cup .
I am waiting for the final of this game .
I want to give advice to children .
Do n't be afraid of hockey ! You are used to sitting in front of a computer , but the best choice is to get up and go to the hockey club .
I am Xyz . I am 18 years old and I am a student .
I am a volunteer and I work as a babysitter . I can cook .
I have experience of this work , because last year I worked at a children 's camp in London .
I enjoy fun with children .
Please contact me .
My email address is xxxxxxxx .
Yours faithfully ,
I am was asking to me if you want to go to a party with me ?
What do you think ?
The party is next week at Julia 's house , and it is going to start at 5:00 pm .
I started swimming at nine years old .
I got first prize in a match .
As a result , I think that I have some talent for swimming .
Since then , I met my teacher at the pool .
She taught me a lot of things , and is the most important figure in my life .
She is a doctor . She told me that swimming would let my body more better .
From then on , I felt my disease decrease and feel relax .
Consequently , I need to swim often .
First of all , swimming can help your health .
The research shows that swimming can decrease disease .
When you are in the water , you will feel relax .
Third , swim can help you make more friend .
You can go to a swimming club . That is a way to meet people with interesting of same .
You should try this sport now .
Many people think running is a waste of time or that it 's very difficult , but I do n't agree .
Now my average jog is 8 - 10 kilometers and going on 40 - 50 minutes .
I have fewer colds .
After that , on the next day , I feel better .
Four years ago , I often had colds and long recovery periods .
Now I have more energy and better health to become happier .
Cause of my leg was hurt .
After rehabilitation , I continued to feel pain in my foot and I still limped .
I decided to put an end to this and , one gorgeous morning , I started running !
As a result , I know the men can be harder than can be seem .
After these moments , you start doing things that many people think impossible or even unbelievable .
I advise starting with one km .
Two to three jogs in a week is the norm for beginners .
First week one km , the second , one km and 300 meters , etc .
4 ) Think about your initial physical condition .
I found an ad for this job on the Internet .
I would like to start working in your cafe , because I am very interested in cooking and everything connected with it .
I have experience of working in a cafe .
My last job was working as a dealer in a lot of shops .
I think I am good at dealing with people , particularly in the food sector .
I have traveled a lot , because this is my hobby . I have learned about a lot of food in many countries .
I am used to working a full - time job .
I am prepared for long working hours . That 's no problem for me , because I am young and I like working and spending time with people .
I look forward to new challenges and tasks .
I hope for a positive response .
Do you have any plans for next Sunday ?
We want to go for a picnic to the park near my house at 12:00 . My husband invited you to that .
Do you fancy coming ?
If you are coming , let me know if you like meat ?
Is Physical Education necessary in schools ?
First of all , It is true that not all people like doing sports because they are hard work and a bit stressful too .
We can also say that there are other more important subjects than Physical Education , like Biology or History .
However , Physical Education is necessary because it makes people less lazy .
Despite the fact that sports are hard work , doctors are always saying that sports improve our health .
Schools have Physical Education to teach this good habit from our childhood .
In conclusion , Physical Education is necessary in schools because sports improve our health and make us feel good and healthy .
