People have had a need for communication since the dawn of time .
Every human being has a need for socialising and that is the first reason why I believe we start making friends .
Personally , I usually get on with people pretty well and make new friends easily as I am a natural extrovert ( or so I think ) .
It usually starts with small talk or compliments , as at school I was taught that expressing appreciation to people can be a good start of any kind of relationship .
A true friendship forms itself on a foundation of strong mutual understanding and this takes a good deal of time .
Friends do not have to share the same opinion on every topic . However , they should respect and support each other even if they disagree .
Mr Smith was found on the floor with a glass next to him which was completely broken .
I thought that he must have called reception for some wine , as the waitress said that every night after he had eaten , he always drank a glass of wine .
All night , the body had lain like this on the floor .
The next day , the waitress knocked once , twice , three times , but no one answered , so she thought that the man might have gone out .
In fact , I discovered that Mr Smith 's nephew wanted all his fortune .
Sometimes , people will do anything for some money .
Nowadays , it 's believed that it 's better to work on your own than to work as a group .
At first , I completely agreed with this , but then when I started to think about it I realized that it 's not like that .
Firstly , I think that if you work as a team , you can help each other and if you have more people to talk about any situation with you can have a better and more complete answer , because you have the ideas and the knowledge of every single member of the group .
Secondly , I think that the members of the team give you support , love and companionship .
Sometimes the members of a group begin to be so close to you that you love them the same as if they were part of your family .
Moreover , if it is a really nice group , it is more fun to work with them than to work alone .
In conclusion , I believe that it 's better to work as a team than to work on your own because the team give you love , companionship and you can have a very good time .
It is well known that an image is better than a thousand words , and that may be the reason for the success of television in a recent survey as the most important invention of the last 100 years .
However , this choice may not be the wisest , as there are other inventions more useful than television and with better future applications .
I am referring to the Internet . Born in the 1970 's as a military project to interconnect missile facilities and the central headquarters , it soon spread to universities and educational centers .
This fact , along with the spread of personal computers , quickly led to a generalization of its use in the first decade of the XXI century .
For more than 50 years , it has been the main entertainment channel , displacing others like radio , theater , cinema and , sadly , also books .
In its first years , television was also an important channel for culture ( theater plays , classic films , etc . ) .
Unfortunately , in recent years , television has lost this educational focus .
The Internet , on the other hand , has become more and more popular , not only for entertainment , but also for business , and today it is almost impossible to find an activity in which the Internet does n't play a major role .
The Internet has also replaced television for watching films and TV shows , especially among young people , who prefer to download and watch videos instead of watching to the fixed schedule of TV .
This experience is unbelievable and unforgettable for me .
It was in winter 2002 when 2 friends and I were working in a hotel in a village called Tignes .
At about 8 p.m in the evening on December 12th , my friends and I went back home .
It was the end of a hard day 's work , so we went to bed early ; we were very tired and we had forgotten to put out a candle .
One hour later , our table was on fire .
Monica and I called out her name and we slapped her face .
At that moment , some friends and other workers who lived on the same floor came into the bedroom .
At the beginning , we could n't stop the fire , but although this night sounds impossible , we managed to put out the fire .
Public transport has been discussed enough but there is always room for further discussion .
Now the question under discussion is whether public transport has a future as travelling by car is gaining more and more popularity because of its advantages .
Well , I think it has a future .
First , there are always lots of people who would prefer not to give much thought to where to park their car or how to avoid traffic jams .
In smaller towns without an underground there are usually a number of bus routes to cover the city area , so , all you need is to go to a bus stop and to get on a bus and soon you 'll reach your destination .
It 's not a secret that gas , insurance and repairs are costly .
Safety issues are also very important .
It is obvious that it is safer for the environment than thirty cars with a single person inside .
You should take into account that thirty drivers ( often inexperienced or aggressive ) pose a greater danger to road users than one trained bus driver who feels responsibility for his passengers and for other people in the traffic .
The answer is obvious , I think .
And the last , but not the least , thing is that there are quite a lot of people who are not able to or just do n't want to drive , so the only solution for them is public transport .
Moreover , cities ' authorities encourage the development of public transport because it creates employment , lessens the impact on the environment and contributes to road safety .
So , my opinion is that public transport does have a future . Travelling by car is convenient but public transport has undeniable benefits for long - lasting life as well .
Michael thought that he could use his father 's car , and borrow some money from his mother .
He knew that Peter was a little bit irresponsible , but he thought that the arrangement sounded perfect and nothing could go wrong .
He was thinking that this time it would be different , everything was planned and they would have a great time .
She 'd gotten used to receiving those short messages every day .
No name of the author on it , but let 's face it - there was only one guy in Brooklyn who would wake up every day before the dawn , no matter if it was raining or snowing , and run like crazy to Alison 's family 's small flat .
Occasionally , her older sister would watch her from the hall and poke her index finger at her forehead . " What a jerk " she 'd mutter under her breath .
Thomas was one of those guys that every gal wished to be around .
He was handsome as hell , well - built and a true gentleman .
He worked hard at the docks to make a good living for his mother .
She lost her job when the war started , as well as her husband - Tom 's father .
Back then it was pretty obvious that regardless of his young age of seventeen , he would quit school and start earning money .
Try to fit a heart and the bravery of a lion into the small frame of sixteen - year - old girl .
Her major health problem was asthma , as well as anemia , a poor immune system and being underweight .
Because of the latter , she 's skin and bones with almost no muscles .
All her clothes are from the kids ' section and yet they 're usually too loose .
But there 's something in her big bright eyes , circled with long brown eyelashes and freckles , that makes her appearance unique and causes Tom 's heart to flutter every time he brings to his mind her piercing gaze .
Alison 's sister , on the other hand , is the total opposite .
The only thing they have in common is the eyes , taken from their mother .
The rest is completely different .
That 's why Mary is constantly surrounded by a bunch of fellas , meanwhile Tom is the only one to follow Alison and have her back .
This film stands out from low quality versions because of its accurate details .
The film , instead , was shot in central Italy and , surprisingly , the scene on the balcony was n't even filmed in Verona .
The young bridegroom is then involved in a brawl and banished from the village .
The acting of a classic is undoubtedly a difficult task , and yet Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting play their roles very convincingly .
However , the water is dirty and it is recommended to clean the pool at least twice a week .
The gym is nice and comfortable , but newer machines should be bought to replace some of the machines that are currently in use .
Also , the court is cheap and the changing room is nice and clean .
On the other hand , the opening hours are not long enough and they should be extended .
It is advisable to paint the walls with a brighter colour .
Apart from the above - mentioned points , there may be so many other ideas which can make a big difference to the club .
Back then , when she had been a little kid , she had dreamed of seeing the entire world .
The woman had smiled at Alice and had given her some words of advice , " Young girl , you will lose something important to you .
Alice had looked on in confusion as the woman had walked away .
Alice had gone around the entire world , from the hottest desert to the highest mountain .
However , when she had arrived , there was nothing but a barren desert .
She was shocked .
Sadness struck her heart .
It had been told that anyone who stepped through it would be cursed , but Alice 's desire had been stronger than her fears .
Finally , after much time travelling , Alice had this feeling .
That girl , indeed , was Alice herself in her youth .
Had you told me that I would win some literary competitions and that some people would speak well of me , I would n't have believed you .
The year was 2012 , and I had n't written anything until that day - I had just been translating some stories and , once , even subtitles for a Korean movie from English and Spanish .
But that day - it was in spring and I believe it was Thursday - my English teacher told us about a literary competition .
The theme was ' I visited the Earth in 2112 ' .
It sounded like quite a good challenge for me , so after finishing the lessons , I quickly sat down and started writing .
And when I wrote down the last sentence I immediately sent it to the stated email address .
Only then did I realise that there was nothing more to do , that I just had to wait .
For the first days I was a little bit nervous , but day by day , I started forgetting about any competition .
But a month ago , my mobile phone started to ring .
I picked up and heard a nice woman 's voice .
And that voice told me that I was the winner of the third place !
I was so happy !
That moment changed my life a bit because I 've started to write more and more stories .
And the more I won competitions , the more proud I was of myself .
Since I was a child , I have been curious to know how stuff works .
Through the years , my interest in machines and electrical devices increased , so whenever a device stops working I try to fix it before calling the maintenance , and my parents always encouraged me even when I broke something .
When I was in secondary school and my friends were dreaming of being doctors or dentists , I decided that I would be an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer , so I entered the scientific branch .
During my studies , my parents and I noticed that I understood kinetic physics more than electrical physics .
Also , I was good at mathematics subjects that related to solid geometry . That is why I decided to study mechanical engineering .
Since I enrolled in the faculty of mechanical engineering , I had a goal to complete my Master 's studies in Europe or America .
After searching and asking , I found Germany has numerous prestigious technical universities , and it offers a great study atmosphere for foreign students and supports them in many ways .
For those reasons , I am convinced that Germany is the best country to complete my studies abroad in .
Therefore , I have decided that I am going to continue my postgraduate studies and pursue a Ph.D. degree to work as a teacher at a university .
I have been looking for a while for a suitable university to apply to .
First , I like the curriculum of the mechanical engineering Master 's program .
Second , TU - Clausthal has a very good rating in engineering on many websites like ranking.zeit.de .
Finally , TU - Clausthal is located in beautiful countryside .
I hope that I get the chance to complete my studies at your university and to gain practical experience in one of the greatest industrial countries in the world .
A lot of different languages are spoken all over the world , and it is not easy to choose one of them to learn .
My view is that , nowadays , English is an important language that it is necessary for almost everyone , so I will choose to learn English first .
The most common reasons to study a language are work and travel .
Although in some places people do n't speak English , you can always find somebody who does .
Even though you have to study vocabulary and expressions , the grammar is easy to understand and you will be able to make simple sentences in a few days .
Whereas there are a lot of options , we rarely start learning other languages before we can communicate well in English .
Their transformation from innocent posters to digital screens ranging in size from minuscule to vast has made adverts all - pervasive .
Multimedia , advertising and entertainment companies now work in synergy to target everyone from toddlers who can barely speak to pensioners confused by the speed of life in the new age , unsubtly playing on their needs and desires in order to turn them all into faithful consumers .
They have so successfully insinuated their own product into our everyday existence that we no longer see it anymore as what it really is : a nuisance .
Creators of adverts have long given up on informing the consumers and instead opt for seducing them .
The result is insincere , misleading and often deceitful messages that our minds are saturated with .
Perhaps it is time to do an experiment and hit a pause button and reflect upon this subject .
Would it be bleak and boring and leave us at a loss as to what to buy , or might it just turn out to be a long - yearned - for respite ?
As a matter of fact , Venice could be a very good candidate for hosting the marathon competition , which will last one day .
Moreover , Venice is one of the most beautiful cultural cities in Italy .
The marathon runners coming before or staying after the competition could take advantage of visiting the city , which offers a great number of attractions .
Public water buses and private water taxis run 24 hours a day , although less frequently at night .
Although the private service is very expensive , it is efficient .
Four and five star hotels are located in the main area , but smaller hotels and a youth hostel are also available for families .
In addition to this , there is a significant lack of evening entertainments in the city , such as theatres , cinemas and night - clubs .
On the other hand , participants will find a wide range of restaurants , trattorias and bars with a good selection of menus offering local food .
In conclusion , I think there will be no obstacles and objections to hosting this sports competition in my town , which , on the other hand , is also a cultural event for many of the participants .
I read your email yesterday but I have n't had the time to reply until now .
I helped with catering for the staff and during the concert I was free to walk around wherever I wanted because they gave me a security badge .
I asked if I had permission to stand in front of the stage during the main concert and the organisation agreed .
I do n't think so .. .
After the show , I had the chance to meet the band members .
Here is a picture from last summer when we were in Halland on an island called Nidingen !
In my family there are five people ; my mom Malak , my dad Claes , my little sister Novalie and my little brother Edvard .
I compete in skiing and I think it 's great fun . I often go skiing in Åre , Vemdalen and in Ramundberget .
Once every year , I ski with my ski club ( Täby slalomklubb ) in Switzerland .
In Zermatt you can see the Matterhorn ( the mountain that you see on Toblerone packaging ) .
In the summer holidays , my family and I just spend time on the west coast on a small island called Kålhuvudet .
That is one of our summerhouses . I love to be there because when we are there we swim in the ocean and we fish for crabs and just have a lot of fun .
You can , of course , see the ocean and it is very beautiful .
My parents call me a shopaholic and I almost agree . I like it because it is fun to look at clothes and try them on .
I read quite a lot and my favourite book is Harry Potter .
If it was possible to go to Hogwarts I would do it .
Now you know what my favourite book is , so you can almost guess what my favorite movie is … Of course , Harry Potter .
But I do also like a movie called The Game Plan .
It is about an American football player who does n't know that he has a daughter and one day the daughter comes to his apartment .
Then it is a fun and fantastic story that I do n't want to tell you because then wo n't be fun to see the movie .
I do n't watch only movies , I watch some series to .
For example , Pretty Little Liars and Modern Family .
Pretty Little Liars is a little bit scary , but I like it .
Modern Family is my favourite series .
I like it because it is very funny .
My favourite song is a song called Chandelier by an artist called Sia .
It is a girl called Jasmine Thompson and she sings cover songs and I think she is a really good singer .
I do also like a song called Classic with an artist called MKTO .
One band I like is One Direction . I think they sing really well .
When they were in Sweden , I was at their concert and after that my voice was almost gone .
But it was really fun to be there , but is what pretty cold , because at Friends Arena the roof was open .
My favourite food is sushi or a fillet of beef with potatoes and béarnaise sauce .
I like sushi because the combination of fish , rice and soya makes it delicious .
I like beef and my favourite is a fillet of beef with béarnaise sauce . It is a very good combination .
My favourite restaurant is a restaurant called Dahlboms in Åre , because they have the best spaghetti bolognese ever .
Hope you enjoyed your reading . I think this is what you maybe want to know about me !
Micheal tried to hit the door with the hammer , but it was useless because that door was made of steel .
Snugly Micheal heard steps coming towards him .
He opened his eyes again when the steps had faded away .
Michael felt strange , because he was n't feeling walls around him .
He felt like he was about to die .
The moment he reached the light , everything changed .
Micheal seemed to be really happy at that moment .
Suddenly , Micheal opened his eyes and he realized it was just a weird dream .
It was an amazing event !
Local people were invited and a talent competition was held .
The number of people exceeded my expectations !
Generally , bands played really well , but , of course , there were also terrible singers in the competition - but it did n't matter so much .
I 'll never forget the sounds and smiles of those happy people with their arms in the air who were standing under the stage .
On the Charity Fun Day , the air was filled with the fabulous smells of Indian , Italian and many other world cuisines .
Unfortunately , not all of the food was tasty , so one of the things I 'd suggest changing next year is to avoid hot dogs .
Also , I 'd recommend delicious homemade ice cream .
It was a fantastic experience , especially for the people for which it was intended .
It 's breaking my heart to hear that you 're in such a terrible situation .
You 're such a cute little girl .
Let me know what your decision is .
I discovered the English language when I was eight , and it amazed me so much that one year later I started to take a course .
English was also the key to my passion for technology . The more I understood the language , the more I understood how to use computers and the internet .
About six months later , I joined a computer class for kids in the same location that I took the English classes and since then , my love for computers and the language has just grown .
That is why I wish to work in the area of Computer Sciences , and studying abroad would give me an extra motivation and open new doors to show and expand my full potential .
Besides being my personal favorite for its culture and language , the United States of America offers big opportunities in this area because of its great universities and educational system .
I am currently an intern on a scientific research program in a group called GALP - Logical Programming Teaching Group , that , with the local city hall of Araraquara , aims to transform the city into a national technology , research and software producing center , accomplishing this goal by teaching logical thinking and algorithms to kids , diminishing future evasion in many exact science courses .
Although I write and speak English at an advanced proficiency level , this exchange would provide the fluency I need in academic contexts and interpersonal communication . As all of the most relevant papers , research and journals are written in English , I want to achieve this level to make it easier to write and produce good materials for the scientific community , and to communicate better with all cultures .
In Brazil , there is a huge lack of professionals in the field of information technology in both academic institutions and the job market . Travelling abroad , especially in the U.S. , would qualify me in both areas .
I would be happy too , if , by any chance , I could apply to summer jobs or internships as another way of gaining experience .
Working as an intern at an information technology company or as a teacher 's assistant would provide me with a good example of how the market works for both academic and commercial careers .
In conclusion , I want to study in the U.S. because of its differentiated educational system , for the work and research opportunities that I might find , to know better a culture that amazes me with its capacity to innovate in all fields , to become fluent in a language that I love , to return to my country with more knowledge in areas that I would not find here , and , in the long - term , become a better professional or teacher , with a good and solid background in computer sciences , information technology and finally , system analysis and development .
There are many places to visit , but the most beautiful is Traku castle .
It is a very popular pace to visit among tourists .
The castle is very big and you will need several hours to visit it .
If you want to visit it , book a guide who will tell you the history of the castle in English .
In addition , there are many souvenir sellers , so you could buy something .
" Installation art " is a new form of expression made of a mixture of media , used by contemporary artists to communicate something in a modern way , different from traditional arts .
It was situated on a stand in Parque Del Retiro , in Madrid .
It was built in two different parts .
The first , placed in a corner of the stand , was made of a pile of plastic bottles and plastic baskets .
Seeing it for the first time , it was impossible to understand the meaning of the column or the pile .
Only after having read the explanation was it possible to appreciate the installation art , and to have a complete understanding of its meaning and shape .
Despite their beauty , new forms of art are very complicated to understand , especially compared to the classical arts .
An example could be medieval art .
Seeing a Da Vinci portrait or a landscape painting , it is immediately possible to appreciate the beauty of colours or the accuracy of shapes and the expressions of the subjects painted .
At first sight , those paintings evoke an emotion in the observer , and the name of the piece helps to have a complete knowledge of the masterpiece .
On the other hand , looking at installation art , it is harder to have a clear emotion at first sight without knowing the meaning of it or something about the artist .
In conclusion , I think that all forms of art are made for the same reason ; to communicate something .
In every historical period , artists have represented their life and what they feel in different ways .
Classical art was easier for us to understand because it has been studied at school and it is very famous , while modern artworks are totally new and more complicated to understand because of their composition and their significance .
In my opinion , the difference between installation art and classical art resides in the feeling that they can inspire in the audience .
Dear Camp Director ,
I have experience of looking after children .
I am always willing to help with anything . I can be very creative when it comes to fun things .
On the other hand , they should learn something new in a summer camp .
Kitesurfing - this sport is getting more and more popular , not only in countries such as Australia , Turkey or Egypt , but also in other ones , like Poland or Germany !
A feeling of being completely free , the joy of moving on a surface of water standing on a small board , the incredible speed - all of those things can easily make you happy .
If you just learn how to keep control of your body when standing on a surfboard and how to steer a kite , there 's nothing that seems hard any more .
Last month , I helped at Adele 's concert at the Royal Albert Hall .
Although I was a cleaner , it was the best thing that has happened to me recently .
Before the concert , I had to sweep up the whole hall .
During the concert , I was responsible for supervision of sort - out in the toilets .
It was n't my dream job , but it really payed off .
After the concert , I saw Adele , and my friend took a picture of me with her !
She smiled at me !
By the way , I met your ex - girlfriend there with her new boyfriend .
Of course , I told her you 're dating Lisa now .
I hope it wo n't be my last job at a concert .
This past year was special for me . I graduated from High School and I took a gap - year .
It was very confusing but probably the best year of my life and I will tell you why .
As I said earlier , I graduated from High School , which was a huge relief .
It was awful .
Thus came the question of what I was going to do next , but I was n't ready to make that decision back then , so with the agreement of my parents , I decided to take a gap - year .
I was going to spend the next 6 months in the United States which actually terrified me .
As my departure came closer , I started to ask myself more and more if this was a good idea and if I would have a good time , all those things .
The journey to the United States was surprisingly good , I had some friends on the plane who were going to the same destination as me and I actually did n't miss my family that much .
The 6 months I spent there were the best of my life . I was so happy and enjoyed myself every day .
I also got to know myself better and I have reached a decision about what I want to do next year . I am going to study at the university .
I hope that I will enjoy that as much as I enjoyed this past year . It was truly amazing .
So if you are ever even considering the idea of taking a gap - year , do n't hesitate , just do it .
I was thinking that maybe it was just my imagination .
Eventually , I slowly opened the door and went out of my room .
I went to the kitchen and sat on the chair , nervously fiddling with my bracelet .
It suddenly fell apart , and all the beads dropped on the floor .
In that sinister silence , it seemed to be the loudest sound in the world .
All of a sudden , my phone rang .
Before I managed to say something , I heard a terrible scream and my friend just hung up .
I felt cold sweat again , just like five minutes ago when I 'd seen the open window .
We haven't talked for ages " .
We at Madhura Nagar , understand the need to protect the environment and hence are committed to what we do .
We limit the number of houses and the number of people living in those houses , because more people would mean we have to clear vast expanses of land for housing , which would mean a reduction in the number of trees and a deathblow to the natural balance .
We encourage people commuting to nearby places to walk or use a bicycle , depending on the distance and those going to the same areas outside the town to join car pools .
We also have a biogas plant on the outskirts that takes care of the rubbish and sewage and the power generated is used for street - lights and meeting the power needs of the community office .
We distribute jute bags annually with our community logo on them , so that people can use them instead of plastic bags .
Each year , we encourage school - going children to plant trees to teach them the importance of trees in safeguarding our environment , so that they can grow up to be responsible towards the environment .
We encourage people who come up with any innovative ideas about how we could further protect the environment .
Dear Mr . Smith
I would like to apply for the job as a security guard for the Openair Frauenfeld as advertised in your Facebook - post of the 18th of July .
I 've worked as a security guard in a lot of places around the world .
I was in the position of leader for a Katie Perry concert and I worked for Angela Merkel when François Hollande arrived in Berlin .
I was a paramedic in the first place , but then I wanted to change something in my life and combined it with my hobby , which is going to the gym , and became a security guard .
With these experiences , I can safely escort people who are knocked out or a bit ill and ca n't stand the concert anymore out of a concert and help them .
The only exception is volleyball - I just ca n't play it , I do n't even know why .
But I love basketball and handball - especially the former - every time we play basketball at school during Physical Education , I 'm so happy about it and I do my best . I do n't know how to explain why I love this game so much .
Maybe it 's because , in basketball , you have to run a lot and you have to be really fast , and my second favourite sport is running .
Anyway - if someone asked me for advice about basketball , I would say : do n't give up if you are n't the best player in the world . I 'm also not .
The public love to know everything about their idols and they always try to find out some spicy details .
Everyone deserves privacy , but public figures should be aware of the fact that society wants to know as much about them as it 's possible .
Whether they like it or not , they should be prepared for photographers and journalists trying to chase them at every single moment of their life .
It might be hard , but they need to be patient and try not to care about the people who interfere with their personal lives .
In my opinion , journalists and paparazzi should n't stalk celebrities on their private holiday or try to get into their intimate affairs .
There are some boundaries that should n't be crossed .
Even though they are well known , they have a right to have free time and they should be able to spend it however they want to , without anyone disturbing them .
It 's really important for people to know the boundary between curiosity and nosiness .
We should respect other people 's right to privacy and let them live their own lives .
Nature is one of the most important themes in the Romantic Age , since it is a reality that inspired many writers , both novelists and poets .
It has been an important subject especially for writers from the ' ' first generation '' like William Wordsworth ; he saw nature as a reality inseparable from man , where it comforts in sorrow and teaches to love and to act in a moral way .
In the Romantic Age , we can find another important subject based on the concept of nature : the sublime .
It is associated with strong emotions caused by natural spectacles , like hurricanes , waterfalls or starry sky .
The sublime inspired many writers , like W. Wordworth and S. Coleridge , who had a conception of it as the feeling brought by the sight of infinite spaces , like the desert , sky or ocean .
The idea of the sublime that Wordsworth had is considered by many as the standard idea of the Romantic sublime : forms of nature that inspire feelings of awe , danger or weakness .
Also , Coleridge had a concept of the sublime , but for him it was associated with infinite spaces and the sense of perdition and suspense .
I am a 20-year - old girl with an immense desire to get busy this summer .
I am very familiar with the tasks and rules that need to be respected in a summer camp , as I have been one in a previous summer camp with the St John 's Ambulance .
It was my duty to make sure everything was running smoothly , according to the program , and I had to supervise and direct the other assistants if any problems should occur .
I am a qualified first aider and I am able to deal with any minor or major health problems that might arise .
I have been volunteering for St John Ambulance for 6 years now and I can say that it is a truly amazing and eye - opening experience .
Here are some tips to help you make a positive first impression .
Instead of that , you should show that you have experience or specific education in the area .
Going to a job interview can be a stressful experience for even the most job seekers , but if you use these tips , the first impression of you will be positive .
I would like to share my feelings about a particular friendship that is highly important to me and , furthermore , evaluate the reasons why it is especially complicated to maintain long - lasting friendships in any situation .
First of all , as far as special friendships are concerned , I must say that I am not a person who makes friends easily . Consequently , I do not have a large circle of friends .
Although it is true that this is not a long - term friendship , I can say that I have found a true friend .
Throughout this friendship , I have been given the support , the affection and the confidence to pursue my dreams .
On the other hand , friendship is a two - way street where you receive and give back the same favors and , naturally , I enjoy doing so .
I value this friendship and it is of great importance to me because it is a balanced , one - of - a - kind relationship .
A reason for this may be the fact that , over the years , people change and grow apart .
For this reason , not all childhood friends grow older as close confidants , simply because they are not the same people as they were before .
As you gradually grow up , your world expands , your personality changes and so do your acquaintances .
However , the natural process of aging is not the only change we undergo , but there are others such as enrolling in school , getting our first job or changing an old one , travelling or moving to another city .
All these situations may impede us staying in touch with old friends , but , on the other hand , can give us the opportunity to make new ones .
To summarize , I would like to say that even though we are incapable of remaining on friendly terms with everyone , we should know that the process of socializing is one of the factors that makes us human and we should always embrace it .
There is also a food court on the third floor , catering to all sorts of customers , as well as a few restaurants on the first and second floors .
On the top floor , there is a multi - cinema complex , offering several of the latest movies .
There are two underground floors for parking , which can get a bit crowded in peak seasons , but which are very reasonably priced .
Another shopping option is the main street in the centre of Viña del Mar , which used to be more popular in the past , but which was displaced by the shopping centres .
All in all , I think there is a wide variety of shopping options in our home town , so I expect tourists would not be disappointed with what there is to offer .
This report has the aim of showing and discussing the main ways to reduce pollution and to take care of the environment in Zaragoza .
Some information about what people do with their rubbish and how they try to keep the area clean is described in the following lines .
Although the majority of the citizens in Zaragoza do n't give special treatment to their rubbish , there are some people who have recycling bins in their homes .
Also , Zaragoza is provided with a number of collection points , where rubbish of large dimensions such as furniture can be collected and recycled .
How does the town try to keep the area clean :
There is a law which states that if someone throws rubbish such as papers , cigarettes or chewing gum onto the street , they may be punished with a fine which could increase up to $ 100 .
A commercial team responsible for raising awareness of the critical situation the environment is suffering .
3 . More than 200 buses with the aim of avoiding excessive CO2 emissions .
Zaragoza 's population is aware of the importance of keeping the town clean and so they 're willing to do plenty of things to avoid pollution and its environmental consequences .
My name is Emma . I 'm 16 years old and I believe that I would be perfect for this summer job .
I have 2 little brothers and I think I 'm capable of taking care of little and older kids .
I 've always liked to play with kids and do fun activities with them .
My favorite activities would be painting , and making up fun games .
Although I like playing with kids of all ages , I think that I will have more things to do with the kids between the ages of 8 and 10 , because I find myself more open with kids between those ages .
I can cook anything , really . Just give me the ingredients and I 'll make you whatever you want .
As I said before , I 'm really good with little kids . I was a teacher once at a summer school .
It was 8:00 o'clock in the morning that Saturday in L.A. , and suddenly an urgent message appeared on the TV news and on all the radio channels .
They announced that the Big One would occur that afternoon at 7:00 PM approximately , so they warned that people had to leave the city or go to safe places in the next few hours .
Peter decided to help his father with his work and the problems that were happening , while his mother was packing the luggage and preparing the car to leave .
Peter and his father were very busy solving the problems of neighbours and it took them some hours .
However , Narwal Ji has taught me from the basics of Indian singing , to being someone able to sing on stage in front of a large audience .
He has given me a great opportunity to grow as a beginning singer to sing during a concert and his guidance as a teacher is something that I will always appreciate .
The night has been a rewarding experience and boosted my confidence greatly .
Overall , the entire night was shown nicely and was entertaining for everyone watching .
You asked us to organise a visit to a place or building that mirrors one aspect of our life here .
We have brainstormed about many possibly interesting locations , and we eventually decided to prepare a little tour in and around the Grand Place of Brussels .
Away from busy and noisy roads , the beautiful old inner city reflects what Brussels really was for centuries ; small but cosy cobblestone streets flanked by small houses and shops in light colours and with old - fashioned roofs .
We would gladly share our excitement about the Grand Place with your students , so that they can immediately get acquainted with it as a very enjoyable place to go to .
Faithfully ,
Most of the year I live in Poznań because of my studies at the University , but every summer I go back home to spend some time with my family and friends .
It opens only in the summertime , mainly for tourists .
Because of that , there are no regular employees , so at the beginning of every summer new season staff are hired .
It was like working in paradise .
The main reason why I loved working there and every day I went to work with a big smile on my face were the possibilities to watch every show I wanted .
There is only one auditorium , so I was busy just between the shows and sometimes , for family shows , there was a 15 minute break in the middle of the show , for the kids to use the toilet or buy more snacks and drinks .
I watched almost every movie shown , some of them more than once .
I mean , it was September , so I had one whole month of vacation ahead of me to do whatever I wanted to and it was awesome because I could finally just relax , sleep , read books and spend a lot of time with my loved ones .
This place really stole my heart and I miss its atmosphere , regular visitors and the people I worked with .
Date : 27 September 2014
Thanks for granting our daughter , Cheung Tsz Huan , the first interview held on 27 September 2014 .
We do hope that she can be granted a second interview as we really appreciate your school vision , upholding the spirit of Faith , Hope and Love to nurture students .
As evidenced by the school visit guided by a polite , cheerful and confident P2 student under the Angel Scheme , we think your school vision has been successful to a large extent .
Our elder daughter , Tsz Yin , who is currently in Form 4 of St. Paul 's Co - educational College Secondary School ( " SPCC " ) , greatly enjoys her school life and , at the same time , has achieved good results in the past three years .
And she has written a letter to you asking you to grant Tsz Huan an opportunity to grow up in the family of St Paul 's .
To share and learn child - rearing tips with other parents , my wife attends the SPCC monthly book club .
To enhance our parent - child relationship and facilitate our understanding of her school and social life , we participate in the kindergarten 's volunteer group .
In addition , we spend at least 3 hours with Tsz Huan every day - reading , talking , painting and playing games .
She enjoys reading , performing arts , including painting , dancing , music and sports , swimming in particular .
Her teachers have complimented her on being focused , creative and eager to learn .
As the parents of Tsz Huan , we are keen to work with the school and be part of its development .
In 1975 , the consumption of fish and chips was ten times higher than the consumption of the other two types of fast food .
However , the quantity of fish and chips eaten per year declined from 100 times per year in 1975 to just over 80 times in 1980 .
In contrast , the consumption of hamburgers and pizzas started at about 10 times for hamburgers and 5 times for pizzas in 1975 , and then rose constantly until it reached approximately 100 times and 85 times , respectively , in 1995 .
The purpose of this literature review is to provide a clear picture of the motivation and business strategy of entrepreneurs in their start - ups .
The literature review has three main parts .
Firstly , the review of literature will define the word " entrepreneurship " in a business context .
Following that , the next section will examine the entrepreneur 's motivations , which covers 2 major aspects : intrinsic personality traits and extrinsic factors .
Thirdly , the current opportunities and challenges of the Vietnamese food market will be reviewed , combined with the literature of Vietnamese entrepreneurs ' motivation .
The place is very near where I live , and I 've worked in a lot of Cafes before , but unfortunately , I had to leave them for school and college .
Sometimes I do n't have time for myself to have fun , and from what I can see from your place , it is very popular and full of fun people .
I 'm very eclectic , but also fierce when I should be .
I may not know how to cook the usual food of the cafe , but I am a fast learner . I will only need one day to get used to the food and learn how to practise at home , and then it 's up to me to find a way to be good at it .
I wo n't be much trouble for anyone .
Set in in late 1950s France , Chocolat deals with the topic of society discriminating against different people because of their being different : whether they are gypsies , women that do n't depend on men , or people that do n't share the Christian faith .
The plot revolves around Vianne Rocher , a single mother and chocolate expert , opening a ' chocolaterie ' right before Lent in a small , closed - minded French village , the mayor of which decides to boycott her .
During Lent , the protagonist gets to know other outcasts ( mainly women ) and helps them .
One of the strengths of the film is its star - studded cast : Juliette Binoche as Vianne , Alfred Molina as the mayor , Judi Dench as a grumpy , elderly woman resented with the oppressing society of the village , and a young Johnny Depp as a handsome gypsy arriving in town with his caravan .
It suits perfectly the theme of the movie , with a little bit of jazz manouche , a popular genre amongst European gypsy communities , and reminiscences of Mexican folklore , as the recipes Vianne Rocher prepares in the ' chocolaterie ' are a heritage from her Mayan ancestors .
If I had to find a downside to Chocolat , it would be that the film format does not allow us to have a deeper look into some of the characters and their story lines .
A must - see if , like me , you enjoy cinema with strong female characters in the lead roles , but you do not necessarily want to watch another dramatic story .
Michael Clifford was a lucky man who had everything he could ever want : he was a thirty - year - old English businessman married to a sophisticated mathematician with whom he had two sons and a pretty , talented daughter . He owned a successful corporation and had a gorgeous chalet near the sea .
He hardly ever drank alcohol , but thought it would be impolite not to , as he had been invited by his colleague .
Later that night , while Michael was cheerfully chatting with the barman , his mobile phone emitted a sound .
He rushed out of the pub , opened the car door and got inside , not knowing that he was to die in an accident because of his current state .
However , it is a wise decision to choose carefully between public and private transport , because they both have advantages and disadvantages depending on where we want to travel to .
On the one hand , private cars are great because they allow people to travel whenever they want .
Sometimes it is cheaper to use public transport , such as busses , trains or airplanes , depending on the distance .
Travelling across the Atlantic Ocean , for example , requires an airplane or a ship .
Trains are a great mode of transport across intercontinental distances , especially since they have become faster .
All in all , I believe that public transport will not disappear very soon .
Time was ticking by and he knew that if he did n't do it now , he would be in deep trouble , that his social life would be over .
All of them anxious to get outside and relax for a few hours , suffering from an endless punishment : knowledge .
As he got near his destination , the density of students seemed to grow and it was becoming even more difficult for him to advance in that sea of moving bodies .
Fortunately ,
Poland is classed as a country with a hard history and a lot of places remind us remind about that .
Besides their past , we can , fortunately , adore their beauty .
In this small part of Cracow , you can meet with Jewish culture and architectural style .
For those who enter , it will be an ' unforgettable ' experience .
You walk among ancient , fallen tombs shaded by tall trees of great age .
It is the oldest synagogue in Poland and was constructed in the XVth century .
Finally , you can do shopping in The New Square , a round trading hall .
You can buy almost everything there : fresh fruits , vegetables , and household products .
On Sundays , the range of products is much bigger .
Parents face important decisions when raising children , not least of which is whether or not they should allow their children to keep a pet .
Some parents would gasp in horror and reject it when their child asks them if he can keep a pet , whereas other parents would be more than happy to let their children have a pet .
I believe that children should have pets because they can benefit from taking care of pets , especially in terms of their personal development .
Take my cat , Luka , for example . I found it on the streets and felt like keeping it with me when I was 12 years old .
My mother told me that I would have to take care of it by myself when I went to ask her if I could keep the cat .
From that day , I started to take care of it on my own .
I took it to the hospital when it was sick , and gave it food when it needed to be fed .
This does not suggest that children can not learn from having a pet .
For instance , when Luka died when I was 20 years old , I was so sad and heart - broken as if a member of our family had died .
After that day , I started to be able to sympathize with people who had lost their beloved ones because I have been through a similar situation .
Based upon my personal experiences , by taking care of pets , children can not only learn to take responsibility , but can also learn to sympathize with others .
In other words , keeping pets is beneficial to children in terms of their personal development .
Not only financial development , but also the environment are essential to a healthy city .
Reducing waste at source is always our top priority and education is of the utmost importance in this regard .
Recycling bins have been installed on every public housing estate and most housing estates , along with the road - side ones found in every district .
We have seen a great drop in the amount of solid waste .
A tree planting campaign is carried out every year in cooperation with schools , community centres , etc .
Eco - tours are also promoted to educate the public and tourists to appreciate the beauty of nature and , above all , to arouse their awareness and cultivate a caring heart towards nature .
With concerted efforts , we have made great strides in environmental protection in recent years , as seen in the declining amount of waste and increasing amount of greenery .
The round table ' Russia - Turkey : prospects of relations on the modern stage ' at St Petersburg State University .
On April 29 , 2014 , St. Petersburg state University hosted the round table " Russia - Turkey : prospects of relations on the modern stage " .
Bekir Günay , the Director of the Eurasian Institute , Associate Professor , spoke about a new understanding of Eurasianism .
He also broached the subject of Eurasian Community development , noting that it 's very important whether it 's developing towards equality or dominance .
In particular , he applied the theory of Joseph Nye Jr. 's " soft power " to the relations between Russia and Turkey .
Other participants of the Turkish - Russian round table also talked about current issues of the history and current relations between the two Eurasian countries .
He also referred to the recent action of the Turkish authorities on the sudden introduction of new requirements regarding the expiration of foreign passports .
Just before the beginning of the mass tourism season in Turkey , it was announced that the passport should be valid at least four months from the date of entry .
The round table at St. Petersburg State University attracted quite a large audience .
During the break , the participants enjoyed traditional Turkish sweets .
Living in a big city , I can cycle to work every day , which I believe is a great way to exercise and reduce my environmental footprint .
Besides , cycling along a canal allows me to witness flowers and trees blossoming and chicks growing up , reminding me of the beauty of nature .
However , I believe that it is at home that I contribute most to saving natural resources ; we are , obviously , very careful with turning off the taps when we wash our hands , brush our teeth and so on , and we recycle as much as possible .
We live in the century of mass consumption , when shopping requires more and more time out of our daily routines .
For some , this activity is a torture ; for others it is the most pleasurable way of spending free time .
But have you ever gone to the shop just for milk and bread and come back with a full bag of goods but no bread ?
It depends on the person how often he goes to buy groceries , probably according to individual needs .
Most consumers do not count time spent in food stores , as they have their own habits and their attitudes towards shopping .
Some people choose bigger supermarkets as they offer a greater variety of goods , but require more time , while others just pop into the closest store and do their shop weekly .
If you have a ready - made shopping list , it saves your time and energy , so that you do not need to wander between aisles in the grocery store .
When it comes to parties , it is even more time consuming and irksome than ordinary shopping .
The queue you are standing in always seems to be the longest .
Hundreds gather there , parking spaces are full , again facing long queues in stores - no matter how unpleasant it sounds , it is the reality nowadays .
People become crazy , agitated or bored while shopping .
Afterwards , some get into their cars and get stuck in traffic jams on the way home , it causes more tension and destroys your mood !
Also , some people spend huge sums of money on things that are not essential . They are attracted by commercials , advertisements , sales assistant recommendations , so they do not follow their budgets by buying everything , as they are excited by the shopping process itself . It causes regrets and financial problems afterwards .
Finally , it may be very tiring , as you may waste precious time just walking around and not finding the thing you are interested in and need .
Then you feel tired and depressed about the idea of keeping on looking for it in another place .
On the other hand , the majority feel lazy and they go shopping just for special occasions , without any rush , they dedicate time in search of fashionable clothes , best quality garments , stylish items .
Although shopping may be entertaining , it is still a time - consuming and tiresome job .
Being busy and spending time looking for clothes , presents , souvenirs , furniture or healthcare products , especially for women , may be a perfect way of spending even all day .
On the other hand , searching for your favourite brands , non - seasonal products , some special goods , just looking through shelves , trying the garments on , asking for advice , testing products , there is plenty of work to do to make a perfect purchase .
This may be the reason why some go for bread and milk and forget about it after entering a colourful and attractive store .
All in all , I strongly believe that shopping is not enjoyable for the vast majority .
Fortunately , this unavoidable part of our lives is not that problematical anymore , as we may experience the pleasures of online shopping without leaving home .
It is a perfect alternative to save time , money and energy for those who are not that keen to hit the mall .
She always wanted to be in the spotlight , and she had always succeeded , since everyone adored her .
She was expecting a letter from the local drama club , in which they would reveal the character list of their new play .
Jennifer had auditioned , and she was 100% sure that she would be the lead woman .
Oh my God , oh my God , that must be the letter from the drama club ! " , Jennifer screamed .
" Dear Jennifer and Carly Brown , We are delighted to inform you that Carly has been chosen to be the lead woman in our new play .
I could n't believe my ears ! I , Carly Brown , the insipid and far less interesting sister of the great Jennifer Jones , the most beautiful girl in town , had been chosen to become the lead woman in a big play !
From that moment on , I haven't been in Jennifer 's shadow anymore - she has been in my shadow .
The industrial revolution took place in England from the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th and it completely transformed this place .
The English economy changed from an agricultural one to an industrial one : in England there was an increase in pollution and also terrible hygiene conditions , the landscape changed a lot and also houses , shops and people .
These big changes influenced poetry a lot and we can see that , for example , in Blake , because in " The Tyger " he uses a lot of colors referring to industrial life ( red , orange , silver .. ) and he describes the Tyger 's creator as an artisan that creates it in a furnace .
In contrast , the American and French revolutions are important because they introduced the ideas of freedom , fraternity and equality , so these concepts also strongly influenced the poetry of the period .
We can see the conceit of freedom in Shelley 's " Ode to the West Wind " , where the wind is wild and it is the very symbol of freedom ; in contrast , in the " Rime of the Ancient Mariner " , we can see the brotherhood of mariners on the ship and of party guests and also the equality of all God 's creatures .
The idea of brotherhood is present also in " I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud " by Wordsworth , because he sees nature , daffodils in this case , as a friend to men .
During the last thirteen years , the cost of living has been significantly increasing in most countries .
This change makes most people have to work every day , even using their private time , so they need to find out the best way to save their time and boost their energy after work .
Fast food is one of the ways to solve that problem .
People who have just done their work are very hungry ; they can not go home and cook their diet meals by themselves but their bodies need to be provided with energy in order to sustain their lives and continue their jobs , so junk food is considered the best way to solve the hunger .
To make it clear , the bosses , who are always busy in their business , usually eat fast food , they go to KFC or Lottie Mart to buy it , they even might order fast food by phone because of fast delivery .
In addition , junk food is very easy to find .
Therefore , finding a good place to buy and enjoy a meal of fast food is not so difficult and it will not take time for people to go back to their work on time .
Junk food contains a lot of unhealthy chemicals and a high percentage of fat and cholesterol , which are the biggest factors leading customers to obesity and cancers .
According to scientists , people who usually eat a lot of junk food will have more than 50% risk of becoming obese and even dying soon .
Furthermore , most junk food just solves hunger in a short time and then it will quickly return to the customers after they have felt full .
Finally , there is the loss of traditional meals .
As a consequence , they gradually forget how to cook a simple meal and the diversity of healthy food is gradually lost .
Some advantages are that fast food can help to save time and deal with the temporary hunger of white - collar workers , but it can also harm their health .
The customer should be careful before they choose fast food as part of their daily diet .
Within 6 years , Facebook has reached more than 1 billion users and is still growing rapidly .
As a shy person , I can confirm the differences between real life and virtual interaction .
For example , if you want to find someone who likes the same movie genres or series on social media , all you have to do is type in an interest .
While it can seem harmless , cyberbullying causes many problems for teenagers , such as depression , suicidal thoughts or even worse .
To conclude , although social media seem flawless , we should always be careful and responsible before we sign up .
I saw the advertisement for a job to work on this summer camp .
I really think I would be the right person for this .
I am really hardworking and love kids . I used to babysit for my neighbour 's kids , so looking after kids will be easy for me .
Working in the kitchen does not seem so bad either , because I know that everything depends on our attitude and if I have a positive attitude . I 'll have a good time no matter if I 'm doing a fun activity or cleaning dishes .
I hope you think I 'm the right person for this . I think this would be a great experience for me as well as for the kids .
People and Change
I feel that this can be attributed , in the first instance , to the changing nature of modern societies .
We are , therefore , in a situation in many countries today where being highly mobile is something
Even though the boat was ready to go , Jessica was afraid of it breaking into pieces again . She could almost foresee that forthcoming heavy rain destroying her boat , so she had an idea .
She tied the boat with long and very strong fabric made out of synthetic fibers that she found on the plane . She also used nails to attach some new and more resistant wood to the boat .
She was ready to leave , but something inside her was telling her to stay . The boat was very strong , but not enough to travel for days and maybe weeks across the ocean . She was afraid .
Meanwhile , Jacob was completely in love with that girl he met weeks before . Her name was Scarlett . She said that her dad was in the military and was working on a high - tech portable device that would change gravity to low levels and for a short period of time , like a fraction of a second , but it was later suspended because their boss told them it was very dangerous to experiment on and it was going to be very expensive . But as her dad continued with the experiment , his boss got so mad he kicked them out of the city onto that mysterious island .
She also explained that they did n't know how the majority of people on the island got there , because not all of them spoke the same language , but they learned how to communicate with signs .
They had a lot of things in common , they liked the same kind of music , the same kind of food and they both liked to read fantasies and comics .
Jacob asked her again if she wanted to go with him to a better place , but she still refused , until she accepted with only one condition : if all her family could go with them .
Jacob asked Jessica if they could leave the island with Scarlett 's family . She was not happy about it , but she said yes .
But they needed to make the boat even stronger and more rigid so it would support all the family and all the extra food they would need .
Some Pro - choice groups and individuals believe that a person has the right of choice . This includes the right to decide if they want to give birth or not .
Even though in some circumstances , such as life - threatening and sexual - abuse pregnancies , it could be the best thing to do .
Hence , every woman must be able to have an abortion as a choice .
Abortion can be given as an option in life-threatening.pregnancies .
The presence of a mother is important in a child 's life , especially in the first few months .
During the first months , the relationship between a mother and a child develops rapidly .
The baby 's inborn capacity for imitation and regulation of visual and auditive stimulation , is gradually patterned and this is supported by the mother 's empathetic response .
This natural process would be interrupted by the absence of the mother and the child 's development could be negatively influenced in this case .
Development of emotional and psychological problems because of maternal deprivation can be a result .
The child will have difficulties building and sustaining relationships during adult life .
Because of this risk , abortion can be considered an option .
Besides , abortion could also be considered in the case of conception as a result of sexual abuse .
Conception as a result of sexual abuse is not uncommon and , in these cases , abortion should be a choice .
Sexual violence has a devastating impact on victims , all areas of a victim 's life are affected .
Many victims believe that the additional trauma related to carrying their rapist 's child can be avoided by terminating the pregnancy , and therefore help them put the assault behind them and recover more quickly .
Even though , not all victims will choose to have an abortion , it has to be given as an option .
Even if abortion has to be given as a choice in special cases , it is not a solution to accidental pregnancies .
It is for the person who decides to have coitus to make sure they use an appropriate contraceptive .
Otherwise , you may run the risk of people seeing abortion as an easy way to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy .
In order to prevent this , it is important to apply strict guidelines regarding situations where abortion is given as an option .
Abortion only has to be approved as an option in life - threatening pregnancies or if the mother has been sexually molested .
Undeterred by this , it is still the mother 's decision if she wants to save her own life or carry and care for her rapist 's child .
I had the opportunity to be a student of and work as a research assistant with Dr. Montés in the same field .
He taught people from different backgrounds , undergraduate and postgraduate students , and managed to explain difficult public health topics marvellously .
Also , in Master 's degree final project II , Dr Montés helped us to accomplish the master 's degree thesis with excellence .
In my work as a research assistant for Dr. Montés , I experienced great learning in many fields , not only in Public Health topics , but also in research methodology , public speaking , and writing .
I witnessed and learned from his ability to work with other faculties , such as Faculty of Medicine , Department of Engineering , Faculty of Economics , and School of Law .
I attended policy making forums and events where Dr Montés was a speaker and his opinion was highly respected .
Moreover , we developed projects with multidisciplinary teams for the following institutions : the Colombian Ministry of Health , and the World Bank , with excellent results .
I think Dr Montés fulfils the requirements of the position you offer .
Since he has great expertise in teaching , and is an excellent boss , respectful of the opinion , time , and personal background of everybody .
I think that he will be a great asset to your college .
I 'm writing in response to the letter Professor Collins wrote to you .
In the letter he complained about the out - of - date system of schools in Italy and he made some suggestions about how this could be overcome by major educational reforms .
First of all , the professor says that the majority of Italian teachers are not well prepared to do their work and , consequently , students do n't achieve the skills they should to succeed in a future job , but I do n't agree with this statement .
I think that the real problem that makes our schools so out - of - date compared to those of other countries is the way teachers communicate with students and transmit their knowledge to them
As a matter of fact , students are often seen as empty pitchers ready to be filled by as much information as they can contain .
They should make their students experience school as a pleasant experience , as something their future is based on .
Secondly , in his letter , the professor suggests that schools should spend more money on computer equipment .
I agree with this recommendation because I think it 's important for schools to make the same progress society does year by year , always offering new materials and technologies , such as computers or interactive whiteboards in classrooms , making studying more interesting and sometimes also easier .
This is what , in my opinion , must be changed in schools to satisfy society 's needs and overcome the old and inappropriate " out - of - date " system .
Many people feel that it is good to make their student life easier .
On the one hand , I firmly believe that students can find more valuable information in textbooks because they have existed for many centuries .
For this reason , I believe that they have more reliable content .
Furthermore , if you go to a library , you could spend all day reading books and learning about different things because in these places there are many ancient books .
On the other hand , I personally think that pupils enjoy working with textbooks more because they can do this activity with classmates and they can help each other .
Also , in my opinion , young people should not use computers for too much time , because this could be dangerous for their health , causing sight problems or headaches .
Taking everything into account , in my opinion , every student should have a good encyclopaedia at home because it is much better for their education .
There are a lot of people I admire , starting with my own parents , as they have to work so hard to make ends meet and to pay the rent as well as their employees and to give us - my brother and me - a good life today and tomorrow .
As a writer - to - be , I admire her work creating a fantastic world of magic and epic as well as dark characters who are recognizable all around the globe .
His ' Song of fire and ice ' saga has been brought into the television world with the title Game of Thrones and it is currently receiving awards as the best TV drama series of all time .
My fascination for those people is that they fought for their people 's rights , the black race 's rights , in a world of white people treating them as slaves and bullying them .
Because knowledge is the best weapon we have got against those who want to rule us as they want .
I am at home in my lovely house , where I love every detail of the interior , where everything is in its place .
It is the weekend and we are all together today .
We play piano , sing favorite songs , play board games , we laugh a lot and love these weekends together very much .
Sometimes , our kids invite friends and today my son came with his girlfriend .
After all the courses that I 've done , I am wise and do n't talk a lot .
Next to me , everybody feels calm and confident . I 've learned a lot in the last 15 years .
Every word I say , I say for a reason .
My kids are proud to have parents like me and my husband .
Together we make this world a better place .
We found a way to help a lot of people to live a happy life and enjoy what they have .
We 've planned a nice event to celebrate my 50th .
Friends , colleagues , family all those people who were next to me on my way to this wonderful day .
I have just started teaching a new , face - to - face group of adults .
I was excited to get back into the classroom . I would mainly teach online that day , and try out some of my new skills on a group .
The group 's native language is Amharit ; they have all had to learn Hebrew , so English is a third or , for some of them , a fourth language .
So I switched off the projector , took out my whiteboard pen , dusted off my flash cards and reverted to traditional methods of teaching .
To begin with , recent statistics reveal that the number of obese adolescents is rising .
And last but not least , it seems that new technologies are not helping to develop young people 's social and intellectual skills .
In addition , spending too much time on activities like watching TV , surfing the Internet or playing video games prevent them from doing sports .
And finally , teenagers may be becoming more dependent and introverted because of electronic devices such as mobile phones or personal computers .
For instance , filling the fridge with a large amount of fresh fruit and vegetables , doing some exercise and having some fun with friends regularly .
How are you ? I 'm taking a year off and staying in London for six months , so I hope you can help me if it is n't too much to ask .
I 'd like to find a part - time job but , first of all , I have to find an apartment to live in , so I was wondering if you could look for a small apartment where I can live . It would be better if it 's near the underground station and in the city centre so that I can go sightseeing in my free time .
I 'm looking for a well - paid job , because I know that houses are expensive in the city centre .
I 'm looking forward to being there . I also need to take a rest and that 's the reason why I want to find a part - time and not a full - time job .
I hope I 'm not asking too much and I 'd be really pleased if you 'd give me your help .
Thank you very much .
The more computer science influences humans ' lives , the more important a status robotics has in the field of engineering .
Only a decade ago , robotics was limited to scientific research .
However , today , it is used in more fields , such as medical treatment , elderly - nursing and archaeological studies , as well as education .
2012 ) described an experiment by Showa University which aimed to test how well dental students could deal with emergency situations .
The result indicated that although the patients were merely robots , out of 98 candidates , only 22% of students gave the diagnoses correctly .
From a survey , 78% and 72% of students considered robot patients to be useful in medical emergency and risk training , whilst 63% of them thought it had great value in training for surgical treatment .
It is obvious that in this experiment , students could acquire knowledge more effectively and teachers could also identify weaknesses of students specifically .
The University of Southern Denmark conducted an experiment which aimed to examine how well robotics techniques named I - BLOCKS ( a modular electronic building block system ) could do at language tests .
Surprisingly , the result illustrated that these robots can not only put words in the right order grammatically , but also recognise whether a sentence is correct or not .
Furthermore , the I - BLOCKS application could also build structures of robots which are able to react to their surroundings , and build binary expressions to calculate in real - time and show both final results and sub - results ( Lund , Marti , & Palma , as cited in Nielsen & Lund , 2008 ) .
With the help of robotics , like I - BLOCKS , students and teachers might spend less time on studying , and some sophisticated processes are simplified as well .
Nevertheless , robotics is not that satisfying because it is complicated to operate , which is always the reason why operators are distracted .
Suh et al . ( 2010 ) described an experiment that aimed to test differences of time on operating robots for doing tasks .
Two groups of participants were asked to do a suture - tying task and a secondary task with distraction , such as decision - making , memory - task .
It was found that there was an apparent difference in average speed and completion time when comparing tasks by students with basic knowledge and those from another group .
Moreover , in the task with distraction , the experienced group was 1/3 - 1/2 faster at analyzing .
Even though it becomes more efficient to study with robotics ' help , complicated operating requires a lot of time .
Perhaps being familiar with robotics and good at operating could help out with this shortcoming .
Today , more people , not only in the field of education , but also in different fields , have made use of robotics as tools to deepen their exploration and studies .
It is possible that robotics will be a normal part of individuals ' lives .
Mordoch et al.(2012 ) conducted some examples into robotics in daily lives : social human - robot , social assistive robot , therapeutic robot , mental commitment robot , care robot , robot - therapy .
For a country , robotics could be a new weapon in the future technological wars .
However , there is some debate that it is unethical to let warrior robots participate in modern wars and fight with real soldiers ( Troop , 2012 ) .
However , the disadvantages of robotics and some social or ethical problems should be considered carefully when robotics is contributing to humans ' lives .
In conclusion , with technology and computer science developing , the application of robotics widens from scientific research to a variety of fields now .
Besides its influences on education , robotics has an effect on medical treatment , nursing and even design for future war as well .
Even though robotics brings more beneficial consequences and advantages than disadvantages , its shortcomings still should not be neglected and more scientific research should be done to improve the application of robotics .
Public transport allows you to save time and money on commuting .
Public transport is so necessary in big cities that the car industry is continuously developing new means of transport .
Not only can customers choose a wide range of transport to commute in , but they can also discover technologies that are not available for private purposes .
In small towns and villages it is easiest to travel by car .
Some places have scenic beauty in abundance , while many are famous for their architectural wonders .
In addition , every person has different tastes , choices and preferences .
Some people enjoy the sight of scenic beauty ; some are attracted towards places of historical and archaeological interest .
I have visited many historical and tourist places in many countries , like Belgium , Great Britain , Spain and others .
But the visit which made a lasting impression on my mind is the visit to Red Square .
Nowhere expresses Moscow , Russia 's vast and ancient capital , like Red Square .
An enormous 400 by 150 metres , Red Square lies in the centre of Moscow and on its four sides stand the Kremlin , GUM ( Department Store ) , the State Historical Museum and the Cathedral of the Protection of Most Holy Theotokos ( aka St. Basil 's Cathedral ) ; centres of government , commerce , history and religion .
It includes domes , cupolas , arches , towers , and spires and is sure to inspire you every bit as much in real life as in the photos .
All these and many more , like its cultural places , famous streets connected to the square and gorgeous as well as old buildings make it the " spirit of Moscow " .
Indeed , the beauty of Moscow is enchanting and has a unique spirit .
Anyway , Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism , which mixes comedy and pathos , while the Brontë sisters ' realism is full of Romantic and Gothic elements and it 's widely influenced by the desolate English Moors , where they grew up .
In addition , Dickens , as well as Charlotte and Emily Brontë in some of their novels , quite frequently uses first - person narration .
For example , in " David Copperfield " , Dickens 's most autobiographical novel , the story is told through a first - person narration from the point of view of the protagonist as an adult .
Much shorter than their fellow tennis players , they have always been able to compensate for their physical shortcomings with an extremely good technique accompanied by a strong head .
You are alone on the tennis court facing your opponent .
Though you might be fighting for a long time and getting more and more tired , you have to search for the strength inside yourself to continue and reach the end of the tennis match .
You must never surrender : until the last ball has bounced twice on the ground , you have to keep fighting , regardless of the score .
Fate may play a role , but you still have to try and bring out the best in yourself .
Nonetheless , it helps to shape your own personality .
I would definitely recommend anyone who would like to start this sport to approach it with a good spirit .
Although it might look difficult at the beginning , with time , you will come to realise how tennis will positively impact on your personal well - being .
I 'm glad I ' ve finally heard from you after all this time .
Anyway , great to hear that you got the job you really wanted and that you are enjoying it quite a lot .
I 'm available whenever you are , so it 's an affable idea to meet up and hang out .
We could go shopping in the city centre . They have some very cool stores that we both will be able to enjoy , even a Primark and I haven't seen any shops anywhere else yet .
Also , there is a huge and cool movie theatre where we could watch a film together , since they 've got some very exciting films coming out .
Or else there are some pubs we could visit . Most of the time I quite enjoy going to a pub on the weekends myself , but it 's all up to you .
I 've had lots of things on my mind recently , especially after my mom died .
It was very considerate of you to send condolences , so please , have my thanks .
I 'm still looking for one suitable for me .
Last summer I thought I had found it .
Also , the staff there was very nice and they wanted me to stay , but I needed more money , so unfortunately , I could n't .
Tell me more about the people you work with and how you feel there .
It was a cold night in November . I was exploring a lost temple with my friend Michael . We had been looking for that temple since our teen years : the temple of the silent cartographer .
The legend says that all the maps of the world are hidden in the temple , protected by a guardian called Soneka the dreamer . He is an ancient warrior and his objective is to kill everyone who tries to steal the maps of the cartographer .
At the entrance of the temple were two statues . The first was white and the second red . The statues were carrying a sword made of gold and diamonds . Those swords were used to fight Soneka and to open the gate of the cartographer . Once we passed the sculptures , our objective was to kill the beast and grab the map of the golden city .
Then we heard a loud noise coming from inside the temple . It was Soneka . His appearance was glorious ; a big warrior wearing golden armor and carrying a big sword , his skills were unmatched , he was faster than the speed of sound . Our only chance was to run to the vault of the cartographer , but only one can pass through the door of the cartographer . Michael decided to stay outside the vault . I ran into the cartographer 's temple and Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Since the concept and preliminary implementation model of the Yiddish Centre was developed in my office , it was expected that World ORT would participate in the project in a few capacities , rather than just including a Yiddish component in our events , subject to the theme .
Some of the aspects were discussed during my meeting with Mordechai in August .
I think that , as Robert once recommended , we should discuss the whole spectrum of our cooperation , not just the seminars , define the feasible components , and have a WJC - WO MOU on such subject signed .
Nowadays , travelling by car is much more common than we could ever have imagined .
And because history has a way of repeating itself , I truly believe that the olden days of using public transport are making a comeback .
On the one hand , owning a car means independence , so that , we can travel anywhere we want , whenever we want , without being tied down to a set timetable and , furthermore , it is certainly more comfortable than public transport .
On the other hand , today we are forced to share transport with other people due to economic problems that our country is facing .
People do not earn as much money as they used to . In fact , they earn a lot less .
Therefore , even though a car is more convenient and more comfortable than any form of public transport , it is also less economical than the latter , which leaves people with no other choice than to use public transport .
How are you doing ? I 've heard on the grapevine that you 're making a killing with your latest PC program .
In contrast , I 'm just getting used to looking things up every day on my computer .
One piece of good news is that I finally gave in and bought my first Smartphone .
It has turned out to be very handy .
I also like to have a look at the foreign newspapers but they only let you read the headlines and the beginning of the article .
I always thought that the Internet was amazing , but now I even surf the web to find some solutions to my children 's homework .
It 's like a blog but it 's written by many people who write their impressions of beautiful sights .
Well , that 's all for now . I hope to hear from you soon .
The structure is divided into these sections :
- Method : Data selection- The three songs we will be analyzing and the reasons why we 've chosen them
Furthermore , we will give some examples of clauses that represent the meaning of our songs better .
- Conclusions : The questions we asked before will be answered .
With our analysis done , this final part is where the results of our work is written and we can tell the difference between these songs and what we thought at the beginning .
These songs are relatively modern , but if we take a look , we will find some sexism in some parts .
However , there 's hope for women to find a song that does n't treat them like an inferior gender .
Still , women are the victim in three different ways . We will search for these situations that share the feelings of regret , created by some specific situations .
Anastasia 's song tells a story of a victim . Meanwhile , the others talk about women that feel guilty because they have hurt men .
We have found this kind of agent in songs with a love relationship as the subject .
In our research , the cognition verbs have been the most common in the group of mental ones , followed by the affection ones , which is quite normal when describing a love relationship .
The woman uses mental and material processes the same number of times .
Regarding mental processes , cognition is the type most used .
The material processes show some actions that the girl would like to erase because they only cause emotional abuse to the man .
As we can see , the boy gave her love and she just wanted to leave him .
If we look at the boy 's processes , we will find only positive things .
The processes that appear more usually are mental and relational ( attributive type ) .
These cases are always regarding good actions or showing the good characteristics of the man .

On the other hand , the woman just says " I 'm sorry " .
The mental processes , specifically the cognition ones , tell us that she has thought a lot about what she did and that she was wrong .
The other participants appear a few times , but these participants tell us important things about the relationship .
Consequently , these participants give us some keys to understand the situation better , but actually they just confirm what the girl feels .
She is regretful because their relationship got worse and it was n't what she supposed it could be .
She broke up , but now she is in his hands .
This can only be explained by the fact that he is a good boy and she was ( probably ) confused .
Although now she is sure , she has suffered a lot . " The cold " and " the fear " were inside her .
Even so , there 's a sentence that could confuse anyone .
She has to do it , and it is a sacrifice .
This means he still loves her , but at the same time , he 's still hurt .
Finally , the woman tells him that she will understand that he does n't want to restart the relationship , but she makes a promise :
The problem is that maybe it is too late and she can only wish " I 'd realized what I had when you were mine " .
This sentence and some others sound like they were spoken by a man …
After the first few words , you will like the experience and it will be hard for you to stop .
It is always interesting to communicate with native - speakers of a foreign language comfortably .
You may find the first initial stages really stressful .
To speed up the learning process , you need to read many comic books in the language that you want to learn . It will be hard to understand everything that you read but the pictures in the comic books will help you .
You also need to choose books by your favorite authors .
This is important because you understand their way of writing and they will be easy to understand . Enrolling on different forums that are in the language you want to learn will be of great help to you .
Anyway , I was thinking maybe you could help me out with this latest one . I 'm supposed to do some research on eating customs around the world and I figured , instead of just doing a quick search on Google and grabbing something off a Wikipedia article , I 'd ask you for a more direct source of input on the habits of the English .
If I quote you in my work , I might score a few extra marks .
Proposal for the introduction of a sports activity .
Those are a few reasons why it is important for us as a healthy group of people to have facilities in which we can practise these kinds of activities .
In my opinion , running is one of the most helpful sports when it comes to starting to move and get fit , in particular for those people who have not been doing any kind of physical activity for a long time .
This activity will not demand huge amounts of money to be done and , with an insignificant investment , would help a large group of people who desperately need it .
To start running , this community will need a few things .
Once people know all the benefits this sport has , they will need a space to practise it comfortably .
With this in mind , money would be spent on constructing a running track where no - one would have to worry about traffic or obstacles in their way .
There are almost no contraindications to practising this sport , so almost everybody in the town has the opportunity to try it at least once .
This activity not only improves your body and health , but also helps you have positive thoughts , making everyone feel happier .
Conclusion
In my opinion , improving the practice of this sport will be a great investment for our community and will have a great impact on our health and in our everyday lives .
The reading passage mentions three ways to prevent cane toads from spreading , while the speaker offers three reasons to refute the reading passage .
The first point , suggested by the lecturer , is that a national fence can not stop cane toads from spreading .
Unless the national fence can prevent the eggs and young cane toads from moving through the waterways , the fence is useless .
Thus , the lecture disputes the idea mentioned in the article that building a national fence could prevent the spreading .
The lecturer 's second argument involves capturing and destroying the toads using volunteers .
It is argued in the listening passage that untrained volunteers could harm the native frogs , which are endangered .
In short , the lecturer questions what is stated in the reading passage that we could prevent the spread by volunteers capturing the cane toads .
Finally , it is argued in the listening passage that a disease - causing virus that killed the toads could be a disaster .
The lecturer says that if the virus was brought to the original habitats of cane toads in South America , it would cause ecological damage to the local ecosystem . To sum up , the lecturer doubts the method mentioned in the reading whereby a specially designed virus could specifically harm cane toads and prevent them from spreading .
To conclude , the lecturer disagrees with the ideas in the passage by presenting three convincing reasons .
National fence , volunteers , and virus are not good solutions to the problem of cane toads spreading .
" Mission : Impossible " soars again with stunning fifth outing !
It it hard to believe that Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise is still able to reinvent himself and carry the weight of a blockbuster franchise like the " Mission : Impossible " series , much more so after considering the fact that he is now in his early fifties , and still looks as fresh as he did in the 25-year - old " Days of Thunder " .
Finally , a special mention goes to Joe Kraemer 's superbly thrilling score , just a masterclass of old - school , kickass orchestral action music .
But it is also because of these sets of beliefs , mostly of religious origins , that some societies fail to evolve and respond to the ever - changing needs of all of their people .
One of the main advantages of cultural practices is that they allow societies to maintain their identities and gain economic stability .
Progress and traditions are not opposites in a society where respect and tolerance for others is the priority .
People who break the law , should be ordered to work in the community in order to pay for their misdeeds , when they have done a minor offence or if they have acted unintentionally .
Nobody is sinless and people should not be treated as seriously as being sent to jail .
This is unfair , because they do not do any harm to the environment nor to society .
It is better that they do a certain amount of community work , for example clean off their graffiti , which will teach them how hard it is to clean off graffiti , and thus , prevent them from making new graffiti .
Working in the community is more appropriate compared to sending people to prison when criminals have committed a minor offence .
Everybody deserves freedom , despite their crimes .
Although their misdeeds should not be tolerated , I believe that they had better do some community work .
For example , in Bulgaria , people who lie down and relax on the grass in the park are sent to jail for 6 years , because they are considered to be " doing serious damage to the environment and preventing the park from further development " .
Community service orders should be used when people have acted unintentionally and when they have committed a minor offence , as this will help them realize their mistakes , without them being limited in freedom by being sent to prison .
This will help them realize their mistakes and thus , quit making them .
The plot is about a teenage girl who moves in with her mother to their dream house , which was next to a home where a horrible double homicide had taken place .
As the movie develops , it has lots of interesting turns that let the viewer draw his / her own conclusions .
Although it had bad reviews , the movie was well received by the audience ; not to mention the fact that Jennifer Lawrence 's appearance right after the hit of Hunger Games was great for advertising .
Actually , I intend to study law but , since there is no ' law ' in the subject choices , I chose economics .
Without law , this world that we are living in would not be in order and peace , but in chaos .
I believe that every human , organization and company has their own rights and it is my duty to use my legal knowledge to protect them from infringement of their rights .
My study plan is to undertake a pre - university programme locally to prepare myself for further studies overseas .
In my opinion , the exchange of thoughts and views between all these brilliant people is exactly where a totally new and creative idea will be sparked .
From a very young age , children can gain basic computer skills through programs that allow them to learn , draw , paint and play .
However , there are various negative aspects to using computers .
Social networking technology is a tool used by people all around the world .
However , I think that this type of technology might be doing more harm than good .
All social networks have their own pros and cons but certainly there are some social networks that affect us more than others .
In conclusion I can say that the social network that affects the population the most is Facebook .
It affects our lives in many ways , including our communication , self- expression , bullying , isolation , friendships , and even our very own sense of humanity .
Facebook has more bad effects on adolescents than on adults , who are known to be more mature about what they post and how they interact online .
It is more likely that adults would use their profile pictures as a way of casually showing themselves , their family , find new clients for their jobs or possibly a recent trip they took .
Comments that are left on their pages mean more to them than words said face to face .
Adults need to teach teenagers the importance of not abusing social networks , especially Facebook .
Teachers at school may impose more restrictions that make teenagers avoid using social networks in an extreme way .
At work , bosses may reduce employee 's salaries if their job gets affected because of distractions that are caused by social networks .
Proposal to improve the school 's facilities for language learners .
First , an inspection of the school 's facilities was organised , in order to assess the school premises .
Currently , each class is given to 50 students which limits their opportunities to experience one - on - one activities that enhance their learning process .
It would be advisable to accommodate classes in the main building , which offers enough space for smaller classes .
Secondly , it was surprising to discover the absence of internet access in the computer room .
Even if the room has a considerable number of computers , the absence of internet access does not give students the opportunity to use the many websites that would be useful to improve their language skills .
Therefore , I strongly recommend guaranteeing internet access , which does not represent a high cost for the academic board .
Access will give learners the possibility to use technological tools that will ensure a better experience while learning languages .
Finally , authentic materials in foreign languages were not found in the school 's library .
It is crucial to provide students with printed materials in the target language .
Thus , I suggest making subscriptions to international magazines in order to enrich the school 's library .
I strongly believe that if the suggestions made in this proposal are given attention , the service provided to language learners will be strengthened and enhanced .
How would the entire world in general and the mountaineering fraternity , in particular , judge my decision ?
I could be pulled over the snowy cliff by Joe 's fall in my effort to pull him up instead .
Picking myself up slowly after the numbness around my waist and hip had subsided , I knew I had little time to apportion blame to Joe or myself .
After all , we were in a team in search of personal glory to be the first to ever climb the west face of this Andean mountain !
I had to look for help ; there was little time to lose .
Ever since I started learning English , I have found watching TV series quite handy , especially those which are perfectly subtitled , in order to follow the plot properly .
On the other hand , I have been in search of a series which catches my attention and it took me a very long time until I finally put my finger on it .
Although the story is focused on the Lord 's family , the service staff has an important part to play , as the world is changing continuously and the nobility is becoming old - fashioned .
The main point in this series is that every character has been absolutely developed , with their own characteristics and personalities .
Even the background is cleverly chosen , which enhances the intriguing and dramatic script .
Needless to say , the actors are sublime and they give their touch to their role , especially Maggie Smith , who is one of my favourite actresses .
For of all these reasons , I highly recommend considering Downton Abbey to be included in your top ten list .
My penultimate position was as chief executive of a company with photocomposition , which was followed by the creation of a publication service serving the " Sell Side " department of Pictet , then Helvea demonstrated my sense of organization and easy adaptation to new environments .
Furthermore , I am fluent in the English language , with good writing skills .
Conscientious by nature , I always strive to be thorough in my work , to be diligent , and consistently complete my tasks .
NB : In addition , in case of employment , I would receive an allowance of a participation of 50% of the salary for a period of two years .
About work , since you are a native speaker of English and you have an idea about teaching English as a second language , you can apply to teaching centers that offer jobs for native speakers of English .
And it will be good preparation for your studies at college .
The success of the soap opera depends on the theme , the people have to decide whether to relate to it or take an interest in it .
As a typical Brazilian , I have a favorite soap opera . It is called Floribella .
The story is about a poor girl called Floribella she is an eccentric seamstress . She has amazing friends and they have a band together .
She starts to work for Mister Frederico , a young and wealthy man who has three brothers to take care of .
He is arrogant , but Flor is the only one who can calm him down in difficult situations .
She falls in love with him , but unfortunately , he is engaged and his fiancée is an awful person who always tries to humiliate Flor .
I 'm afraid to say that this soap opera does n't have a happy ending and I did n't enjoy the end either , but I still recommend it , because it 's a beautiful love story and the characters are really amusing and the story is funny and lovely .
Despite its ending and all others odds that it may have , I 'm still a big fan of Floribella and I ca n't wait to watch it again on Netflix .
And by the way , the soundtrack is awesome , you 'll be addicted to it .
Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) is indicated in more than 90% of mission statements around the world .
As for my city , the mayor gives the environment his top priority and a budgeted plan under the process of implementation .
awareness sessions have been made to explain the difference between re - use , recycle and reduce .
Different color trash bags were distributed to citizens to be used at home to separate the trash according to each material .
Also , films on soaring birds were played to explain the importance of birds in cleaning the atmosphere .
It is worth mentioning that schools are considering the environment as part of the education system that should be taught to students .
Finally , I 'm proud to say that taking care of the environment is part of my and my family 's daily life .
Trash distribution , using green products that respect the ozone layer , not wasting water and many other actions .
I am writing to apply for the position of assistant professor of English with an emphasis on nineteenth - century American literature that you advertised on the February 20XX MLA Job Information List .
Over the past five years , I have taught a variety of English courses .
I have extensive experience of working with ESL students , as well as students with a variety of learning disabilities , including dyslexia and dysgraphia , and disabilities like ADD and ADHD .
I pride myself on creating a classroom environment that accommodates the needs of my individual students while still promoting a high level of critical thinking and writing skills .
Some of my most satisfying experiences as a teacher have come from helping struggling students to grasp difficult concepts through a combination of individual sessions , class activities , and group discussion .
I argue that , rather than being submissive to the requirements of the editor or publisher , female authors in fact developed a more transparently reciprocal relationship between themselves and their readers than has previously been assumed .
Not so long ago , I watched film called " 47 Ronin " .
The action takes place in Japan , in the time of samurais and witches .
The main hero is a mysterious stranger , betrayed by everyone , sold into slavery , chosen by fate to exact revenge , who will become one of 47 warriors that defy death .
Appearing from another world , he will rise up against the darkness to protect his forbidden love .
I also liked the plot built on the basis of a Japanese legend .
And I just ca n't forget to mention the beautiful scenery and realistic special effects .
A transportation vehicle that has changed people 's lives .
Not only that , what prides itself as the most influential vehicle - as most people recognize - is the automobile .
There are people who have never ridden a bicycle , and people who have never been on an airplane , but it would be hard to find a person who has never been in a car .
It is generally believed that the invention of the car has led to the dispersion of the population out of urban centers , to the growth of the suburbs .
Prior to the automobile , is the horse and wagon life , it was not feasible for people to live far from their place of work .
Moreover , it has led to an important expansion in commerce , resulting in the growth of the ubiquitous shopping malls , department stores , serving as a powerful pull for tourism .
Being able to live far from one 's workplace , people can travel far and wide for pleasure and indulge themselves in a remarkable trip .
It may be for a day , a week , or a longer period of time .
In the urban city , the car is by far the most common mode of transportation and has greatly impacted on the growth of the tourist industry .
Though good enough , the growth of the population and mobility do not tell the whole story .
This powerful vehicle is considered vital for another reason : being an indispensable factor in many respects .
It is the key that supports many industrial fields , such as steel , machinery , plastics .
The whole business success would not have reached perfection without the help of transportation to distribute their materials and commodities well .
Thanks to the speed , excitement , and convenience of cars , our lives are enriched .
The newest Japanese restaurant in town - Ohana restaurant - is the place to be on a Friday night .
The staff 's clothes are beautifully coloured and , believe it or not , all of them are Japanese and can speak English fluently .
The moment you go through the huge wooden doors , the music sets you back into the Meiji Era and you feel like you are about to meet a very important samurai .
Work and social life both play important roles in putting people 's lives together .
In my opinion , my social interaction balances my life more than my working experience does .
The companionship of our loved ones is always the best solution to release our pressure .
For example , every day it seems that an extremely tight deadline is always chasing after me and making me breathless .
Meanwhile , I always feel exhausted and barely have any energy to talk with anyone after a long day at work .
However , I can always recover my energy after having a nice little chat with my family or friends .
Therefore , the happiness derived from my social connections helps to alleviate the stress related to work .
Take my yoga class , for example .
Both acquiring new knowledge and making new friends make me feel happy .
Therefore , an active social life not only benefits my mental health but also keeps me in a good mood .
Lastly , some people may think that co - workers naturally melt into our social life , since we spend so much time in the workplace .
However , most of the time , people maintain a good relationship with their co - workers in order to accomplish their common task harmoniously .
For example , we talk about something trivial , such as gripes and gossip , with our colleagues .
Therefore , the more deeply our emotions interact , the more greatly our happiness is influenced .
In conclusion , because of intimate support , growth in life experiences , and emotional interaction , I agree with the statement that my social life has more of an effect on my happiness than my occupation does .
In other words , even though I can get temporary happiness from accomplishing a work task or gaining a compliment from my co - workers , personally , I think I obtain more permanent enjoyment and satisfaction from engaging and interacting with the people that I love .
As a result , I believe that my social life influences my personal happiness more than my job does .
When I opened the door , imagine my surprise ... There was a large box standing in front of the door , addressed to me , and I had never received packages before !
The only post ever sent to me was a birthday card , sent by my grandmother before she passed away .
Still a bit surprised , I grabbed the box , which proved to be no picnic , as it felt as if it had been filled with rocks .
If only I had looked a bit more carefully where I placed my feet ...
Children and elderly people ca n't have a driving license , so if they need to go somewhere , using public transport is their only option .
Travelling by car is also very detrimental to the environment .
In big cities , the air is very polluted because there are too many cars . Travelling by public transport reduces the impact on the environment , something that most people are aware of , but still they prefer to use their own vehicle .
There are some reasons why people leave shops in a bad mood , or even do n't want to go into them .
For others , it is overall a pleasant experience they can not enjoy as much as they would like .
Firstly , shopping may be uncomfortable , because more often than not we can hear tiring music there , saleswomen can be too intrusive and the queues are usually very long .
Sometimes women go to the store just to look at the new stuff , to look around , and questions asked by salespeople make us angry .
It is said that the man who goes shopping for more than one hour is angry and tired .
Sometimes it is also a problem for women who want to go shopping with their partner .
To sum up , doing shopping is unavoidable , so we can make everyday shopping more enjoyable .
For example , we can take at least one family member with us .
Going from one store to another can waste your time , cost you a lot in gas , as well as mentally and physically exhaust you ; when it comes to products that you regularly use , buying in bulk is the best option you have , since that way you get a bigger quantity for a lower price ; or just choose online shopping - a great way to make your purchases from the comfort of your own home , without having to go out on a rainy day , deal with noisy ( and sometimes even smelly ) crowds , spend money on gas and wait in huge queues .
First of all , I would like to begin by giving some information about the city where the place that you will be visiting is located .
The city of Istanbul is one of the famous and crowded cities of Turkey , which constitutes the country 's economic , cultural , and historical heart .
The population of Istanbul is over 20 million and Istanbul is among the largest cities in the world by population within the city limits .
The Historical Peninsula is the centre of ancient Istanbul where the four major empires were ruled from .
I would like to touch on some of them .
Hagia Sophia was built as a cathedral in 537 , converted to a mosque after the conquest of Istanbul , and is now being used as a museum .
Topkapi Palace was built in the 1470 's and the Ottoman Empire was ruled from this palace for 380 years .
Basilica Cistern was built in the 6th century and is the largest of several hundred ancient cisterns that still lie beneath the city of Istanbul ; 143 by 65 meters , with a holding capacity of 80,000 cubic meters of water .
Beyazit Tower is 85 meters tall located in the courtyard of Istanbul University 's main campus in Beyazıt Square .
Actually , I was asked to recommend only one place , but the Historical Peninsula is an area where those historical distincts got together .
I hope the information given is useful for you .
I am writing in regard to some important documents I left in my hotel room during my stay .
Last week , I attended the C&A meeting as one of the major speakers .
The following conversation was so engaging that I forgot the time and , as a result , I was late for my departure for Chicago .
I am not completely certain , but I remember that the last time I saw them was near the tiny blue table located in the left - hand corner of the room .
If you find them , could you send them to my office by post ?
Having goals in life will make one 's life meaningful and purposeful .
They are studying at an English university abroad and becoming a programmer .
Being able to study at an English university will give me the opportunity to get a better job and an exciting experience .
Secondly , the experience one gets from a multicultural medium is very valuable and makes one more mature ,
There are many reasons why I want to be a programmer .
Primarily , because being a developer is my dream job and , secondly , because developers make a lot of money .
I have wanted to be a programmer since I was 14 years old .
For example , if I want to marry in the future , I have to be able to send my kids to a decent school and provide them with what they want . Not to mention wedding party expenses .
To sum up , graduating from an English university and then becoming a programmer are currently my main aims .
Having a good job and a high salary will make my life richer and more rewarding .
With the advent of privately owned vehicles like the car , an individual 's dependence on public transport has certainly been reduced .
However , that being said , in my opinion , there is still a future for public transport .
First of all , from a cost perspective , public transport is much cheaper compared to a car , especially when a cost - reduction concept like ' car pooling ' is not followed .
The financial benefit that public transport gives to the common man is second to none , especially in common situations like long - distance commutes for daily work .
In addition , from a ' time savings ' angle , increased usage of public transport results in reducing traffic and helping people reach their destinations quicker by avoiding being delayed in traffic jams and at lights .
From an environmental perspective , the use of public transport ensures that carbon emissions from automobiles are prevented , helping to preserve the balance of nature even in big cities like Tokyo and Delhi , where the carbon emissions are very high .
However , there 's always a channel that broadcasts a new episode .
Besides that , it 's very likely that you can find some programmes you like amongst all the trash because of the wide variety .
During the past five years , I have been organizing various events not just in England , but also in the United States and Portugal .
However , I have also previously worked with older people .
As a matter of fact , when you get to know me better , I am very helpful .
Today I want to talk with you about the process of making bank notes .
We use cash every day and it is of great importance to our daily life .
Firstly , some things about design must be taken into consideration .
Not only the background colour , but we also need to choose the artwork .
Apart from that , we also need to design security features .
After that , we now need to print them out .
Every bank note should be coloured both sides and we even need to use special ink in case of being copied .
Some good quality sheets will be packaged and distributed to the market but the bad sheets will be disposed of .
Maybe there will be some partially damaged sheets , so the bank notes will be separated into good and bad .
The main features of these bank notes are good quality and the effort made by bank workers .
So do n't look down on the bank notes in your hand now ; they are precious .
It got out of control and they started fighting .
Peter tried to stop them but it was impossible , so he tried to find somebody to separate them .
He did n't find anyone , so he grabbed Louis and tried to calm them down .
Lucas wanted to apologise and forget what happened , but Louis was really angry , so Lucas decided to go home .
The ball went straight through the police station window and broke the glass .
Peter got so scared that he ran away .
Louis got caught and told the police that Lucas was the one that had broken it .
The police went to school to talk with Lucas and try to find a fair punishment .
Peter knew that Lucas was n't guilty but he and Louis had been best friends since elementary school , he had to make his decision and he only had two minutes until they took Lucas to the police station .
Peter got up and told the police what really happened . Louis tried to apologise , but it was too late .
Louis had to pay for the window and also clean the school 's canteen for two months , but he realized that what he did was wrong , so he apologised to Lucas .
It seemed that the man in the wheelchair was looking for something but suddenly , he took a couple of books and put them into a hidden pocket in his wheelchair .
Angie and the store detective ran after " the false disabled man " but he was younger and , obviously , he ran faster .
When it seemed impossible to catch him , a girl , who was crossing the street in a wheelchair , crashed into the thief and he fell down on the pavement .
Because of this , the store detective was able to catch the thief and recover all the books .
To express her gratitude , Angie called the girl an " honorary customer " of her bookshop and gave her a crime novel collection as a present .
When the American series ' House ' was first broadcast on TV , it immediately hooked the audience .
The unusual scenario and the great actor , Hugh Laurie , made the result really innovative for a TV series .
He only agrees to take on cases nobody else can solve and most of the time he succeeds .
Due to an unsuccessful operation he had on his leg , he is addicted to painkillers which he makes several attempts to detox from motivated by his only friend Dr. Wilson , but he never really wants to , so he gets addicted again .
Nevertheless , he is willing to do literally anything to save a patient 's life , although he sometimes goes too far .
The series had a great appeal in many countries , which is demonstrated by the eight seasons that were produced .
His revolutionary behaviour and the fact that he let nobody restrain him are the reasons for the series ' huge success .
Also , the medical cases are intriguing and , although someone with no medical knowledge may not understand much , the struggle to save a person 's life captures everyone 's interest .
The innovative aspect of ' House ' is that he often takes illegal actions , for example breaking into a patient 's house to investigate environmental factors which may have caused the particular disease , and he is hardly ever punished for it .
I believe such popularity is well deserved , as apart from its scenario , it was , on the whole , qualitative .
My only objection is that it sometimes went too far , which made the audience dislike Dr. House .
Nevertheless , it is distinct from other medical series as he constantly thinks outside of the box .
The first time I heard about volleyball , I was in my last secondary school year and we were invited to cheer on a local team during a regional tournament in Lima , Peru .
I was amazed by the atmosphere at the Coliseum , with its shiny wooden court , the noisy people around it , that sharp sound of the referees ' whistles ... Then I decided to take up the game .
Once I got fit enough , I started enjoying the game , learning its strategies , developing personal and group skills and having fun at the same time .
I would strongly recommend young people to take up this sport .
The aim of this proposal is to present suggestions regarding the ways in which the extra funding could be used for the benefit of the students and , indirectly , for the benefit of the local community .
Needless to say , in order to combat the rising tide of social problems in Hampshire , the Education Authority decided to increase funds for the educational sector .
Sporting activities might boost the student s ' overall condition and this is the reason why they are necessary .
A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeare 's more enjoyable than solely studying them will .
Cookery classes are very important because students here are young adults that need to have basic skills such as cooking in order to manage themselves and live an independent life .
Cooking classes will help students spend less money on eating out and they will start eating more healthily because by making their own food they will be more aware of what they are eating .
DIY Classes
As most college students will soon leave for university and will live in dorms , without their parents , they are obliged to fix malfunctions by themselves .
The information they acquire during these courses will help them for the rest of their lives .
These courses will develop the civic sense of students and they will start getting involved actively in society .
The Education Authority believes that social problems are linked with a decrease in participation in extra - curricular activities and it suggests that the college should use extra funding to solve this issue .
Today 's television is the paradigm of our society , because of dozens of new channels constantly popping up and only very few controls are done on the quality of what is actually broadcast .
So , TV , which could be an invaluable source of information and entertainment , actually is becoming a big issue for the development of our society and younger generations in particular .
The potential risks for our younger generations
Having easy access to such a rich offering before having developed the ability to make correct choices or filter the information received , our children and young people are constantly under attack from dangerous role models , being attracted by the ones who seem the most winning and cool ones , without any chance to distinguish if they can be taken as a guide to their growth or not .
The absence of parents or the fact they usually have no control or way to drive their choices makes me very worried about the future of our society .
It 's not too late , though , to try to bring our beloved TV back to the importance which radio had for our parents and grandparents , we only need to see it as a potential new social problem and start a process of control and continuous improvement , maybe giving the most virtuous networks the chance to be highlighted .
I believe that if public transport has no future , then our environment will not have one either .
However , the use of public transport , especially in densely populated cities , allows people to save time while commuting to their study or workplace , as trains and trams do not get stuck in traffic jams .
It not only helps reduce pollution , but also allows users to save money in a world where the cost of gasoline is exponentially increasing .
I believe that people should limit the use of their cars to special occasions , such as road trips or long - weekend leisure activities .
Only by doing so will we help to keep our atmosphere free of CO2 emissions and all the grim consequences they have .
I read about your summer camp on the internet and I would love to work with you .
I 'm 16 years old , tall , extroverted , very energetic and cheerful and friendly .
I love kids , and I 'm very outgoing .
I think I can be very helpful to your camp , helping you take care of the kids and also helping you in the kitchen , because I really love to cook .
When I was younger , I went to a camp , and it was one of the best memories I have , so it would be really great to know I would make some kids feel the same way .
I really hope you accept me in your camp , and I await your response with excitement .
Today , I 'd like to share with you a small but historic story , together with my own view on it .
I hope you will like it .
In the historical , there was a dynasty called Jin , during which this story took place .
At an early age , he lost his mother to illness .
As a result , in order to be sure that he could get the same love from a mother as other children , his father married another woman .
On the contrary , the reality was inconsistent with what he expected .
Not concerned with the harsh environment but her own appetite , she demanded Lucky Wang make a delicious meal with fresh fish .
In desperation , he walked to the river bank .
So depressed was Lucky Wang that he simply lay on the ice weeping .
It was exactly when he was hesitating whether to go home to face the beatings from his stepmother or not that two carp leaped up out of the ice and flopped onto the bank in front of him .
Surprised and delighted , the boy took the fish home and prepared delicious fish soup for his stepmother .
After listening to the short story , some people were deeply moved by the happy ending , however , others thought it was unrealistic .
No matter what the fact was , or even if it never happened , the story just wanted to emphasize the importance of Filial Piety .
Even if it was a fiction , the goal to make all the people in society be filial could also be achieved , which would keep the society harmonious as well as orderly for a long time .
Also , it was the governor 's ultimate purpose .
In this day and age it falls on the taxpayers .
It does not boost their confidence in future prospects .
We often hear that no obstacle is ever insurmountable . However , is it true ?
Sooner or later we will have to face the music .
Only in that moment will we understand that we are one of the millions of pensioners who need a lot of different services to live as fulfilled and independent a life as we deserve .
First of all , it would be a good idea to encourage young people to start saving money as soon as possible .
In such a way , they can remain alert no matter what will happen .
Secondly , the state could take 5 percent from every salary .
The pensioners would receive their money when they retire .
It would be a long - lasting benefit for both parties .
Our state would have a large sum of money , which is an invaluable resource .
On the other hand , the pensioners will be sure of their futures .
Everyone should think not just about his own benefit , but about others .
However , step by step , we will work our way up .
Firstly , I have to say that I disagree with the statement " There is no future for public transport " . I think public transport has lots of advantages , more than travelling by car .
You only have to be aware of when your public transport leaves and be there a couple of minutes before .
You can relax when you are travelling , listening to music or reading a book .
Maybe you spend more hours than travelling by car but I think it is worth it , because you can save money .
I usually travel by public transport and it is half of the cost of if I do it by car .
So , I think the statement should be like this : " There is no future for travelling by car , because public transport is so much more convenient and cheaper " .
I 'm not a huge fan of sports in general , but I do take pleasure in engaging in smaller - scale basketball matches , most of which would probably fall into the so - called ' street ' category , or streetball to be more specific .
It takes a higher level of creativity and spontaneity to succeed in it than your usual basketball match , since its flexible rules , no - coach system , intensified relationship between the player and the crowd , and reduced number of participants widen and complicate its field of possible actions .
The ' style ' factor of it ( or " aesthetic value " if you will ) also plays an important role , again , intensifying the relationship between the team and the crowd while granting the pleasure of contemplating and executing flowing movement sequences , finishing a play , or just stylishly mocking your opponent .
Not to mention the social bonding ability of it , while game tension between the opposing teams is somewhat inevitable , the irreverent , human , no - strings - attached nature of streetball events always compensate for its negative aspects ( which , upon closer inspection , appear to be shared between every single sports event ) .
It is a fun , culturally - enriching experience which I recommend anyone interested in going beyond the competitive aspect of sports to try .
Moreover , they often smoke and drink alcohol , which causes serious physical and mental diseases ( CasaColumbia , 2007 ) .
Furthermore , teenagers have changed their lifestyles and now they are generally sedentary , since they use their computers or watch TV all day long instead of doing sports .
Nevertheless , governments claim that nowadays they are more aware of the importance of health than in the past .
For instance , in Chile , the programme Elige Vivir Sano tries to improve the eating habits of young people in educational institutions , where fun activities are promoted to students while integrating healthy living ( Elige Vivir Sano , 2012 ) .
On the one hand , public transport is more convenient for large cities as it provides a service to a larger number of people and we avoid traffic jams and the need to find parking spots , besides the fact that we wo n't get worried about leaving our cars parked on the street and , when we come back , the car could have been robbed or stolen .
On the other hand , cars tend to pollute more than electric trains and this problem ought to be taken into consideration when someone has to decide between using public transport or a car .
Public transport has been improved to such an extent that , nowadays , it is probably competing with private transport .
Although we can choose more destinations and it is more comfortable , prices are not competitive enough to definitively substitute the car .
Without a doubt , long - distance journeys are best carried out by plane .
When considering the bus , users feel that it does not offer any advantages compared to the car and it is only taken when no other option is possible .
If not , they would not make the investment of a car and pay for its maintenance costs and fuel .
Indeed , the public transport cost for the same journey done by car hardly covers the amount invested .
More and more , the oil shortage makes prices for fuel increase , and so does the price for public transport ; the economic policy of importing countries tends to establish saving measures in order to be strategically less dependent .
Moreover , considering pollution , private transport seems to be much more difficult to manage , because it is an individual decision .
To sum up , future generations will have to face the challenge of a sustainable world and , certainly , public transport will play an important role .
I found out about this new shop from friends and pictures online , so I decided to go check it out for myself .
As I had arrived just as they opened at 1 pm , I had the whole place to myself .
The majority of the space was taken up by a U - shaped marble counter where customers can sit and observe their desserts being made .
The patio is probably a bit narrow to place tables outside , but people can go out and enjoy the view when the weather is cooler .
I started chatting with the chef , who told me that he wanted to start a dessert lounge for people to relax and enjoy desserts .
He felt that a lot of places out there tend to make the experience too rushed , where you have to queue up for an hour and finish eating in 20 minutes before they kick you out .
There are currently 9 desserts offered on the menu with prices ranging from $ 108 to $ 138 , while there is also the famous Improvisation dessert for 2 at $ 328 . I could n't decide what to get at first because they all sounded so interesting , so I asked the chef for recommendations .
He recommended the Bamboo Charcoal as the theme is chocolate , which was perfect for me !
Each dessert comes with some appetizers to cleanse your palate .
The test tube contained watermelon juice with sea salt , which was very refreshing to drink in the summer heat .
Bamboo Charcoal ( $ 138 ) - I got to watch the chef as he prepared my dessert at the counter and I was getting more and more excited about tating his artful presentation as it came to life !
It literally looked like a piece of abstract painting .
This was a chocolate themed dessert with bamboo charcoal ice cream , chocolate ice marshmallow , chocolate caviar and raspberry sorbet .
I did n't know what charcoal ice cream would taste like , but it was actually chocolate mixed with a bit of charcoal .
The chocolate flavor was rich but not too sweet , while the raspberry sorbet was delightfully tart and tangy .
My surprise favorite was the microwaved sponge cake that the chef added at the last minute .
He told me that this is a new method of making sponge cake in the microwave that results in a very fluffy texture which would be hard to achieve in a traditional oven due to temperature constraints and timing .
The dessert also came with a choice of coffee or tea , so I opted for the Lime Flower & Lavender Tea on their recommendation as well .
My tea was brought out with a teapot and a small hourglass timer and I was supposed to wait 3 minutes before I poured the tea .
The smell of the lavender was wondrous , while the flavor was almost mint - like and refreshing to drink .
They also offered me some honey to add to my tea when I thought it was n't flavorful enough at first .
Verdict - I was very impressed with the desserts at ATUM Desserant , as they were delightful for both the eyes and the mouth !
The price was n't cheap for dessert , but if you take into account the entire experience and compare it to what you pay for drinks at a bar or lounge , it 's pretty comparable actually .
They also told me that they plan on introducing a new tea set menu during the day , so stay tuned !
As the days go by , more discoveries are being unearthed at a rapid pace .
Imagine looking at Shakespeare in his English class , Einstein in his first science class , and Picasso picking up his paintbrush for the very first time .
Nonetheless , there are some disadvantages . If a person possesses a magic power that is too powerful for others to defend themselves against , he or she can basically rule the world .
Additionally , terrible wars will break out if one group of magic possessors get greedy and try to take away other people 's powers .
It has been a long while since I last saw you and dad .
Undeniably , the food culture disparity between China and Japan is tremendous , although our ancestors originated from the same ethic .
But still , our customs have evolved a lot .
Due to the geographical conditions where Japan is located in the Pacific Ocean , people here have adapted to eating raw fish and like to offer it as a main dish to serve customers in most restaurants .
Unfortunately , I do n't like eating raw foods , especially under - cooked fish .
It arouses in me a feeling of nausea .
So , I can only have a cup of noodles on those nights when I leave school at 8:00 p.m.
progress of integrating into their culture .
Last week , we went to Mount Fuji .
The mountain was half - melted with a glacier on top .
I have never seen such scenery like that in my country , since the climate in South China is humid and hot .
The same goes for me .
When we play football , we definitely cooperate with the other teammates in order to be the winner .
The one who is in the back position will try their hard to block the opponent teammates from scoring , while those who play in the attacking position will make up their strategy in order to score .
This clearly shows that football needs strong cooperation from all of the team 's players .
My advice to those who are starting this sport is to practise a lot , as football needs continuous practice to master the game and be the king of the field .
My second piece of advice for them is to always have a cooperative game with your teammates .
The worst players are those who do not put their trust in the other teammates and the best ones are those who put their full trust in their teammates .
Scuba diving is obviously one of the most exciting and thrilling sports on earth .
I definitely embrace the fact that the diving community has recently been exploding with many new enthusiastic members , not only bringing a unique experience into our lives , but also enhancing awareness about environmental conservation issues among the broader public .
The downside of this is that hordes of eager newly trained divers populate the underwater world , often with little clue as to the life - threatening risks that they are taking .
From my point of view , it should rather be seen as a license to learn .
Consequently , I see a pretty massive responsibility for the instructors and dive masters in telling the newcomers about the risks of their sport .
To my great astonishment , I witnessed a completely different pattern of behaviour time and again .
I saw dive - buddies and even professional dive masters pushing and encouraging novice divers to extend their limits in order to dive to that spectacular wreck or enter that mysterious cave when they simply do not have the appropriate training for it .
You can imagine that it is really traumatic for divers when they encounter a corpse in the water , not to mention the great distress such a disaster causes for the family that was left behind .
The bottom line is : get as much out of your diving experiences as you can , but stay safely within your own boundaries set by your personal training and practice .
I love teaching because I love to learn and love to share my knowledge with others .
Successful communication between different cultures will happen only when we express ourselves precisely and interpret the information accurately .
Students have to master language skills , with which the students can achieve their academic goals .
Acquiring a language and culture is a long - term process which includes learning , practicing , making mistakes and correcting .
As a language teacher , I hope my students will have a deeper and broader understanding of this language , their interest in this language will be stimulated by the course and they will learn the language constantly .
Fame is a side effect of work in the media and so is spine disease for people who work in an office or threat to life or health for firefighters .
It would be completely pointless if we were judging people on the basis of the job they have .
Everyone is equal , so everyone deserves the same .
People who decide to work in show - business or the media have to be aware of having less privacy .
which is an inseparable part of this kind of occupation .
Because of their fame , they also give employment to other people , like paparazzi and journalists .
We live in times where people are very curious about other people 's lives , so the above - mentioned occupations are necessary ,
but let 's think ... is it really so interesting to know , for example , what Madonna 's second husband eats for breakfast ?
Would we , not - famous people , want that kind of interest ?
Let 's step into famous people 's shoes .
So , let politicians , film stars , singers and others be .
Michael had been running on empty all week .
Besides being in charge of organizing his younger sister 's surprise birthday party , he had also been put in charge of the entire Information Technology department of the company he worked for .
His former boss retired and nominated him for the position , claiming he was more than qualified and had the appropriate skill set to keep the department on track as well as make any necessary changes .
The truth was he had been expecting a promotion in the near future , just not in this precise week .
Michael did n't mean to sound ungrateful , because he was delighted , but the timing could n't have been worse .
The only problem was that it seemed nothing was going to work in his favour . The servers had crashed and he was the one who had to fix them .
As soon as one problem in the company was solved , another one , just as infuriating , would come up with the party planning .
He was exhausted , so he decided to go home , let his mother deal with the party , and any problems would be taken care of by his co - workers .
It was risky , he knew it , but he had no energy left in him .
The scope of this report is to give readers an overview of the historical development of water treatment , the changing perception of standardization of water treatment , and the continuous improvement of the technologies that are involved due to the growing lists of water quality parameters to be monitored .
Clean and adequate water supply system is a vital aspect in public health and social prosperity .
It is essential for all forms of life in which water participates in numerous biochemical reactions such as distribution of nutrients , removal of metabolic waste , and body temperature regulation .
Water treatment must meet the requirements of public and industrial standards .
Mithen 's ( 2010 ) research shows that most ancient civilizations inaugurated themselves near water resources and successful civilizations were dependent upon delicate systems of water transport .
Although the importance of water quality was not well understood , the importance of water was apparent to our ancestors .
80 - 20 BC , wrote forty books of world history and in the translated version by Oldfather ( 1939 ) , Siculus provided early documents about purifying water , such as through boiling and sand filtration , dating all the way back to 2000 BC in ancient Greece .
Since microbiology was not yet studied , people at that time could not distinguish between clean and polluted water .
The main precautionary measure was purely judging the turbidity of the water , and this false practice has remained ever since , even nowadays .
It took years for people to recognize that their senses of smell and vision were not reliable judges of water quality .
The development of qunats ( Figure 1 ) began about 2,500 years ago in Iran . They were sloping tunnels drilled into the foot of a hill that contained groundwater .
Unlike the past , where people had little knowledge about sanitation and hygiene , with better scientific understanding and public education , people learn to think and evaluate the quality of the water that they are drinking and using every day .
The history of water treatment continued in 1670 , as two Dutch glass makers investigated magnification glasses and that led to the invention of the microscope .
This scientific discovery broke down barriers and enabled biologists to observe organisms that were invisible to the naked eye ( Figure 2 ) .
The " Chachas " is a restaurant situated in a mall on the outskirts of Bern .
People of all ages and cultures eat there .
The restaurant 's slogan is " positive eating " and they definitely live out that phrase .
The large dining room with a high ceiling is what catches everybody 's eye , especially when you set foot in the restaurant for the first time .
This said , you can imagine the atmosphere is comfortably airy .
Sitting at any table , you can watch the chefs preparing the fresh food .
Assembled around those long tables , you will find smaller tables and even a cosy lounge for people waiting for a free table .
The menu offers a wide range of mouth - watering Thai dishes including starters , curries , noodles and desserts .
Another aspect I would like to emphasise is the service .
The waiters go out of their way .
They are courteous and industrious .
And , as I know that my classmates prefer light and healthy food , I highly recommend going to the " Chachas " restaurant .
There has been substantial attention to writers ' self - presentation and identity in online social media recently ; Boyed ( 2008 ) studied how teens present themselves online through Myspace site ; Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) reports that people present a different identity on Facebook through using " a different language and writing style " .
Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) refers to the " forms of participation " in social media and having the sense of an audience in mind as the key elements that can possibly change " the way people think of themselves " that changes the way they present themselves and their identity online as a result .
He refers to using nicknames , for example , as a means of self - expression that can shape the audience 's mind and interpretation of writers ' identity .
Lee ( 2014 ) defines three methods of self - presentation in most social media : ( 1 ) " online profile " ( p. 97 ) , that is the " entry point to social networking " .
Examining teens ' identity construction on social media , he states that profile is where teens " express salient aspects of their identity for others to see and interpret " ( 2008 : 129 ) ; ( 2 ) " continuous status updating " , that is updating about life and sharing experiences from the " first person " point of view and ( 3 ) " visual representation " , that is " visual images " ( p. 98)(emphasized as in original ) .
Continuous updating , as a method of self - presentation , is one of the features of blog writing by which blog - writers can share their emotional experiences and views with the audience .
Whether the weblog - writers prefer presenting the world from their own angle , through using the first person pronoun , or tell their stories through the readers ' eyes , by involving other grammatical subjects , is among the focuses of this study .
The children were playing outside , old and new couples were enjoying their love , and everything seemed to be completely bright .
They had plans for the future before .. he thought he would marry her .
And then everything had crashed .
Michael tried not to think about it and to listen instead to what she was saying ...
Her voice was weak and feeble as she said " .. and I was really depressed , you know , and then I thought ... we always talked about going to India ... and I thought ... maybe we could fix everything .. so .. I'm just asking .. will you go to India with me ? "
But suddenly , he thought he was really angry with her .
" I 'm sorry , but I do n't want to hear from you anymore " he said , and then stood up and , without looking at her , walked out of the bar .
As you know , I spent last month in Eastern Europe working for a similar cultural organization and I have hands - on experience of organising a cultural festival and particularly a musical concert .
I loved my job there and if I had an opportunity to do it again , I definitely would .
During my staying there , I was responsible for taking care of the musicians and contacting the media .
What I especially loved about my job there , was the opportunity to work with such a diverse group of people .
I also really appreciated the practical experience I was able to get there - how to organise work in the office so that everything goes smoothly and everyone gets what they want , how to use social media for advertising and promotion , how to communicate with the press and television etc .
It is well known that gossip magazines are bought by lots of people who are interested in what these people do , the kind of clothes they wear , or even the tattoos they have .
This happens because some people are famous just because they have had an affair with a singer or a footballer , so the only thing people want to know about them is if that is true or not , and when it happened .
In the case of politicians , I do n't mind what they do on their holidays , for example , if they work properly when they should .
But I think there is an exception : the monarchy .
I think the Royal Family is an exception because they are supported by all the citizens , so I think we ( as citizens ) have the right to know everything they do if we want .
It happened that one day a friend of mine took me to a Film Club session .
Meanwhile , Elen was going to receive a birthday present from her boyfriend , Ken : a house for them both to live in .
At first , Ken , had thought about giving her some cruise tickets as a present .
A house for them to live in !
Ken was a big guy , short hair , sharp teeth and nose , light skin , blond hair and sky - blue eyes .
That day was the day , Elena 's birthday , and Ken was n't sure how to give that massive present when , suddenly , he had an excellent idea .
When Elena took it off she was blown away , completely amazed at what she saw .
Elena could n't have been happier with the situation .
That morning , Michael woke up full of energy and feeling very optimistic about his first day in his new job .
Every single detail should be perfect to make the best first impression .
You only have one opportunity to make a good first impression , he said to himself .
When he was totally satisfied with his look he turned his bedroom light on and off eight times .
When he arrived , the receptionist told him to go to his boss 's office .
" Yes , come in , please " .
He liked her straightaway .
She was a very kind and intelligent woman , and Michael was sure that she was going to be a perfect boss and they would work very easily together .
After the meeting and when he was leaving , he turned back and said : "
And congratulations on the baby ! " His boss looked at him angrily:- Do you think that I am pregnant ? " .
" No , no , I mean ... , I do n't think you are pregnant at all " .
Our city offers visitors a huge range of possibilities to go shopping .
If you are crazy about fashion but your budget is really tight , there are a lot of second - hand shops where you can buy a lot with a little money .
Window shopping along our high street is another option .
Here you will find all the trendy brands and much more .
For example , people interested in cooking have some gourmet shops where they will be able to taste our traditional products .
A must for all tourists , even if they do n't want to buy anything , is the oldest shopping centre in the country .
Other modern malls are located in the suburbs , but do n't worry , our city has an excellent public transport service to get there .
When the weather is good , especially during spring , street markets are really popular .
It is celebrated on mother 's day , in May , the first Sunday and it is located in the city 's longest avenue , around a kilometre full of flowers , where you can make your own bouquet for your mother 's present .
These are some ideas to enjoy shopping while you are visiting our city , but there are many more to discover !
Yes , it 's true that the car is far more convenient than public transport .
When you 're driving your own car you have a lot of comfort .
You are sitting in a comfortable seat .
And you never , ever , come into contact with other people .
You do n't have to wait till it arrives and it is never late .
Your car will always go to the right place - no transport changes , no awkward routes .
But , will it always be the best choice ?
When you want to travel the world or just go to visit your parents who are two thousand miles from you , it would be better to take a bus or a train .
So , in that case , it 's better to leave your car at home .
And what if the car you 're driving breaks down ?
Just imagine that you are sitting in the broken down car , at night , without any sign of a car service for fifty miles around you !
The high cost of fuel will definitely be the lesser evil in this situation .
For short distances , maybe one or two hundred miles , a car is ideal .
But if you take a big journey alone , you 'd better take the good old bus , just like 100 years ago .
People may say that travelling on public transport is the future for our lives .
But in truth there is no future at all for it , as our lives nowadays are becoming more and more demanding in terms of multitasking , goal seeking and family conciliation .
Public transport offers a range of timetables for trains , buses or metro , but when it comes to dealing with the day - to - day tasks , we very often find travelling in our own car is the easiest way .
For instance , travelling with children is very annoying on public transport due to all the security issues involved .
Waiting at the bus station for our next bus after just missing the last one , being stuck in the middle of a crowd trying to reach the same train as everyone else , does n't make our lives any easier at all .
At the end of the day , we decide to use our car , as , the way we live today , combining work , family and hobbies all at once , cars becoming mobile houses seems to be our best option .
You wanted to know what I was said to do before and during the concert , so I will try to explain everything .
The concert took place in Los Angeles , it was a month ago I think . You can be sure that I had the time of my life .
Everything about helping at this concert was so exciting .
I had to take care of other volunteers .
Dealing with other people is the hardest part , especially when they 're the same age as you .
There were people from Russia , Germany , Brazil .
It was really great to meet them and to talk with them .
Before the concert started , me and my co - workers had to clean the stage , set up the equipment and make sure everything worked well : the sound , the lighting and the instruments .
I particularly enjoy the sense of freedom that it gives me : there 's nothing better than being out on the water with only the sound of the waves , and of the wind in the sails .
I find that people consider sailing either a very boring sport , or a very dangerous one ;
Indeed , people can get bored while sailing , if they just sit and do n't interact with the rest of the crew ,
Sailing is all about cooperation , and to really enjoy it one needs to do it regularly , to be able to get to know the crew and find the most suitable role on the deck .
Being a good sailor does n't mean knowing all about it , the point of sails , the winds , and so on . For me , a good sailor is someone that knows the boat s / he 's sailing on , and is able to deal with all the possible situations and also the kinds of people s / he might possibly have to deal with .
So , the most important piece of advice I would give to everyone is : try ,
and if the first time is not so good , try again : in different weather conditions , with different people , and different kinds of boats .
Maybe you will not get addicted to it as much as I am , but I 'm sure you will have a great time , and , in the worst case , you will have the chance to meet wonderful people .
First of all , public transport is far more convenient for people in big cities .
Nowadays , environmental pollution is also important . That 's why public transport should be promoted as an environmentally friendly means of transport .
A car is not always much more convenient . For example , in a big city it is far more convenient to use the underground than a car during the rush hour .
When we use public transport , we can read a newspaper or book and when we drive a car it 's impossible .
In my opinion , nowadays , driving a car is very stressful because of traffic density .
Driving a car is also more tiring . A driver must concentrate all the time .
Of course , public transport is not always more convenient .
When we want to go on a weekend trip to the countryside , a car is irreplaceable for families with children or animals .
Also , going on holidays by car can be very convenient .
With a car we are more independent than with public transport .
There are many pros and cons , but for sure , we ca n't say that there is no future for public transport .
This summer I am bringing a group of 12- to 14-year - old students to Athens and I am looking for suitable accommodation .
At present I am uncertain about the number of students , but it will probably be about 15 .
While we are there , we not only want to see the many attractions in the city , but we would like to visit some of the beautiful places nearby too , so we are looking for a reasonably priced hotel , in the city centre , with good transport links .
During our stay , we require the following : twin - bedded rooms , in the same hotel , breakfast and , on occasion , evening meal .
Furthermore , I would like to ask you if there are any individuals who would be able to look after groups like us ?
Also , it would be great if you could inform me of some special discounts , such as cheaper air travel .
The final section of this proposal makes some recommendations about what should be done to improve the website aesthetic and improve user - friendliness .
A survey was conducted among the 200 people who filed complaints .
The majority of people were of the opinion that the site was clunky and hard to use and nearly two thirds of the participants considered that the design needs to be modernised .
Other problems cited included pretty low uptime of the website , connection issues and login problems , particularly correct credentials not working .
Implement a tutorial to facilitate better usability for new users , and also make it possible to retake the tutorial as per user request .
Conduct a survey on a minimum of one thousand people on what features the website should include .
Although it had been a tiring day , she was very proud of that little sheet of paper .
No one could have imagined that she was such a brilliant person and when she gave the article to the boss , the latter was quite astonished .
The next day , the boss ordered her to write an article about the natural beauties of Colombia , a small State located in South America .
She used to live in a flat , so she had never discovered how different and beautiful the world was .
That evening , she met with a local guide . She was invited to taste the local food and to dance with the traditional clothes of that friendly civilization .
The following day , she went back to London where all her family was waiting for her since they were very curious about Alison 's weird trip .
All over the world , people of different ages are very fond of sport and games .
It gives us a lot of pleasure and many moments of joy .
They prefer reading interesting articles about athletes and sports events , but they do n't go in for sports .
There are a lot of kinds of sports , such as swimming , wrestling , cycling , boxing , football , hockey , track and field athletics and so on .
This is a very popular sport and very good for your health .
You run slowly and enjoy the beauty of nature around you .
This kind of sport is getting more and more popular all over the world .
If you go to Europe , you can see a lot of people who go in for jogging .
Speaking about sport , I ca n't help talking about football , because this is very spectacular kind of sport .
Some football players are world famous ; they have excellent careers and take part in every championship .
Perhaps they find ordinary sports too boring and unexciting .
There are different types of extreme sports . For example , rock climbing , rafting , scuba diving , surfing , snowboarding , parachuting , hang - gliding , bungee jumping etc .
However , they are becoming more and more popular even among beginners .
Doing such sports , people learn how to overcome difficult situations and how to survive in an emergency .
In skysurfing , you jump out of an airplane and use a board to " surf " the air , doing gymnastics in mid - air !
Winter sports always have an element of danger .
For example , snowboarding , which has all the excitement of surfing but on snow , is more dangerous even than skiing .
If you want to feel fit , you 'd better go in for one kind of sport or another .
I think that everyone must do everything to be healthy .
To tell the truth , I do n't do sports regularly and it is not an essential part of my daily life .
In summer , I go swimming as there is a beautiful pond with pure water where my Granny lives .
In winter , I go in for skating .
If I have free time , I go to the nearest skating - rink with my friends and we have a lot of fun , skating together .
On the other hand , there are programmes which bring nothing new into our lives .
Therefore , one should not waste time watching them .
Violent programmes , reality shows and others of that kind have nothing to teach .
In these cases , TV is undoubtedly bad entertainment .
All in all , it is my belief that if we use it properly , i.e. , if we carefully choose what to watch , television can have an important role to play in the learning process of every one of us , and in particular , in the lives of people who can not afford to travel , buy books or live in an educational environment .
If you are looking for a film that provides you with suspense and action at the same time , I recommend you to watch " Now you see me " .
The film , directed by Louis Leterrier , is about four magicians , known as " The Four Horsemen " that are joined together by a mysterious benefactor , and during their presentations they do all kinds of illegal stuff , such as robbing a bank or ripping off their own boss .
Because of them , there 's an agent of the FBI , Dylan Rhodes , that pursues them through different states of the EE.UU .
They are capable of making you think they really know how to trick someone .
Morgan Freeman is the best actor of all times and perfect for the role of developer of tricks and helper of the FBI to catch the " Four Horsemen " .
Also , there is no actor better for the role of agent than Mark Ruffalo .
But it 's not just the acting that is great in the film .
So if you enjoy magic tricks , surprises , very handsome actors and splendid actresses , why would you miss it ?
What I did not do in the vacations
During the vacation , I did n't enjoy my time because I did n't find out that I am a wizard .
Sadly , I could n't meet Lady Gaga or Justin Timberlake .
I was very disappointed because I did not do any of these things during the vacation .
I did not go to Hogwarts or turn my brother into a frog .
As aliens did n't kidnap me I did not travel all around the galaxy during this vacation week .
After not being a wizard nor kidnapped by aliens , I did not meet Lady Gaga in New York or hang out with her and Justin Timberlake .
We three could n't sing together or make fun of Kim Kardashian .
Indeed , what I did in the vacation was sleep the whole day , hang out with my " Unfamous " friends and write and compose two and a half songs .
But , let 's face it , doing these things is not as wonderful as discovering magic powers , being kidnapped by aliens or singing a song with Justin Timberlake and Lady Gaga .
We will be travelling by car to a campsite in Germany .
Even though it is a large campsite , it feels small and cosy .
Some hikes are short , but steep and some hikes are long and involve no climbing at all .
Monica works as the main chef in a restaurant situated in Manhattan , she has been Rachel 's best friend since high school and she longs for a boyfriend ( she finally marries Chandler ) .
Rachel has always been daddy 's little girl but , when she breaks off her engagement at the beginning of the soap opera , she loses all her money and has to work as a waitress in a cafe ( though she gets a job related to the fashion world after a few years ) .
Joey is ... well , he 's Joey : not so clever , a great one for the girls , and -the most important- Chandler 's best friend .
The most interesting thing about ' Friends ' , in my opinion , is the love story between Ross and Rachel : the plot starts when Rachel comes to live with Monica in her apartment and Ross falls in love with her .
Living without the Internet : Is it possible ?
From 7 am to 7 pm , my computer is running the Internet .
Not only do I use it for leisure , but I also use it for work . I will have to change the way I do things on a daily basis .
Will I have to start buying magazines and newspapers to be informed ?
My daily routine is based on having access to the Internet : talking to my friends , reading the newspapers , the weather forecast , and so on ... I will have to change my life .
The wrong choice can lead to a big mistake that can influence our life and people around us .
What if that boy was smarter than him ?
The only way was to show and prove to everyone that he was the best .
So , he decided to ignore him completely .
He did n't answer his questions and did n't want to use all his ideas .
The work was done and Michael was proud because everything was done by him .
He praised Michael 's work .
They both left the office quickly .
Most people love donating money to different charities , but have you ever thought about why it gives us such pleasure ? I believe it 's because , as humans , when we see someone happy , it makes us happy , especially if we are the reason for that happiness .
Is it the poor , homeless children in your country or the starving people in Africa , or is it some cancer organization ?
When I think about donating money , I see sick children and adults with rare diseases , and small groups of scientists and doctors doing their best to help them , but who do n't have enough money for research . I choose them because I know that they are the last people who get help - because how would people help them if they do n't know about them ?
First thing I do if I want to make a donation is go on the internet , and search Google for rare diseases .
Then I look for the diseases which the scientists are currently working on to find their cure .
I ' m left with a lot to choose from , so I see which illness is the hardest to endure and choose this one to donate my money to .
This makes me realize that even if I have a disease , as hard as it is , I 'm still better off than others and I 'm grateful .
To sum up , I believe more people should start donating to the less well - known charity organisations ; to the ones who need more help .
It would be sufficient to just see the smile on their faces .
We should all be thankful we are what we are , because we could be a lot worse off .
According to Berkow ( 2004 ) , airway management is one component of anaesthesia procedure to ensure the patient 's airway is open .
Also , this practice is the primary consideration for efficient post - anaesthesia care ( Scoot , 2012 ) .
The majority of patients that have had general anaesthetic , like Mr. Sharma , must recover in a PACU ( Post - anaesthesia Care Unit ) to monitor the vital signs , especially the airways management due to the anaesthesia , impeding any postoperative complication ( Scoot , 2012 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 2011 ) .
The first 24 hours post surgery is considered the most critical period , because the patient can present , primarily , lung disorders , and the nurse needs to maintain cardio - respiratory stability ( Popov & Peniche , 2009 ) .
Addressing the airway management after Mr. Sharma 's admission to PACU , the first procedure that the nurse should carry out , is follow the A - G assessment protocol , to review the stability and the airway patency of the patient , sustaining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Mr. Sharma 's airway should be spare and clear of mucus or blood ( Pudner , 2010 ) .
Due to the surgery , Mr Sharma is in a supine position , but this position reduces his oxygenation ( Snowball , 2012 ) , and can also impede the air passage , This is related to the anaesthesia effect , where the tongue and the lower jaw fall backward .
Therefore , the oxygen therapy needs to continue immediately along with his admission , via nasal cannula or oxygen mask within 4 to 6L / min , until the anaesthesia effects are completely gone and the patient 's oxygen saturation is restored ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Thus , Mr. Sharma is being given O2 via Hudson mask 6L / min , because he received general anaesthesia and all of his muscles are relaxed and , at the moment , he does not have control over his reflexes ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
To help with this issue , the nurse should make certain that Mr. Sharma is comfortable , and elevate the head of the bed for a more upright position in order to facilitate and increase his oxygenation , helping him to recover from his respiratory instability faster ( Snowball , 2012 ) .
I would like to start by saying it is free .
The second piece of advice is that you should try to find the best places to walk around you .
Sightseeing is very important once you start walking .
Do not forget to greet me when we meet on the road .
All students are different in terms of their cognitive styles , learning levels and achievements , as well as motivation , personality , and pace of learning .
While conducting a needs analysis , you can have a general picture of learners ' motivation for learning English .
After that , teachers are supposed to use partnership and grouping exercises and activities in order to meet the individual 's needs .
Through teamwork , students at varied levels can cooperate and learn from each other through discussions .
It is beneficial for both the higher and lower achiever because they can assist or get help from each other .
Differentiated instructions , giving different tasks for the same activity , are proven to be necessary in a class with varied levels of student .
Teachers can assign tasks which have different levels of difficulty , or different numbers of tasks to students at different levels .
Finally , preparing supplementary materials for both the upper and lower levels of students , so that the higher achievers can stay excited and challenged , while the lower achiever can also learn at their own pace of learning .
Students have more opportunities to learn languages , discover foreign experiences , pass internships and study abroad .
Our generation is more developed and diverse in spheres of modern culture , including art , music , literature etc .
In Ukraine , young people are different too .
We can define it by a list of the TOP music chart on music channels .
It 's necessary to emphasize that Ukrainian music has changed a lot from the time of Independence and is now developing very fast .
It 's interesting to mention that there is a fashion for Ukrainian traditional clothes " vishyvanka " now .
I hope after reading my report you will have some minimal understanding of Ukrainian reality .
Also , I encourage you to visit Ukraine and to see its sights , to feel the culture and speak to nice people !
It 's a small town and there are not too many options for travelling by public transport .
If you want to go to Vigo or another city which is nearby , the coach service is a good and not too expensive option .
The coaches are slow , so most people prefer the car .
If your destination is further away , another good option is to travel by train .
The train is more expensive , but at the same time , it is more comfortable .
So I think that creating a small bus line between the villages would help a lot of people , especially the older ones .
Dear Sir / Madam
I have been learning English for 5 years and I hope to take the FCE ( Cambridge exam ) soon . I also write a blog about art in English .
As a member of the student club at my college , my responsibility is to organize events and collaborate with many students from different departments .
Working on projects helps me improve my organizational and planning skills .
At the beginning , short and animated movies would be the best , such as the movie " Validation " , which teaches us how words have the power to change our lives .
With my experience and range of skills , I am sure I can contribute to your idea and organise great movie nights .
I am happy that you have chosen to spend next year in my country .
I am sure that you will find Brazil a perfect fit .
As a country with one of the longest coastlines in the world , I definitely would recommend you to visit the beautiful beaches we have .
I would also recommend you to visit the city of Rio de Janeiro , there you will find beautiful beaches , wonderful weather and the wonders of nature in a modern and international city .
You will be amazed by " Cristo Redentor " and " Corcovado " . I have no words to describe how beautiful they are .
Another very good option is exploring Brazil 's Northeast , which is as beautiful as Rio de Janeiro is .
Most of the biggest American companies have been in Brazil for a long time and , as an English native speaker , it will be easier for you to find an internship .
The nine months that you will spend travelling around Brazil will give you a better understanding of Portuguese and that will be an advantage to you when finding a new job here .
I have many tips to share with you . I 'll be glad to do it in person when you arrive .
Once again , there is no better place in the world to spend this time you have available .
If you prefer shopping outside , taking a trip to King Street would be the thing to do .
If you want typical souvenirs , you can go to Buckingham Palace , you will find a lot of small shops that sell souvenirs for a reasonable price .
As you know , I enjoyed helping at a concert last week .
It was a really exhausting but illuminating experience .
We tried to make everyone have fun .
There were a lot of visitors from other countries , so we often had to translate the conversation and help with communication .
But the most memorable thing was a meeting with the stars of the concert .
I could n't be more excited about being in the UK for six months !
I agree with you that I 'm brave , but I think I need this time to relax after all the problems that I had with my grandmother .
I 'm planning to improve my English and I have already registered on a course .
My classes will be from Monday to Friday , but just in the mornings .
I 'm sure that I will enjoy visiting all the famous castles and churches .
Besides that , I would love to travel to other European countries .
If you ca n't go with me , I think we could go out some nights .
I have a high level of spoken English , as I have been learning it since early childhood .
After graduation , I spent two years working as a supplementary education teacher .
My tasks included organizing sports and other activities for children .
I was also in charge of providing safe and entertaining activities .
Dancing is something that human beings have always done , in one way or another .
When I was a child I wanted to learn how ballerinas could dance so gracefully .
Also , I always loved classical music .
Luckily , we got word of a dancing school .
That , by chance , happened to be near my town .
I spent four years doing one of the things I love the most ; dancing .
This is a short story written by D. B. Caulfield , the older brother of Holden Caulfield who is the main character in The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger .
Some of the selected aspects for this assignment were the characteristics that Holden says he likes in others of his favorite books , since this is one of them .
He does not like that his brother is " prostituting himself " by writing scripts for movies , since he does not like movies .
I also noticed that one team was not writing anything .
When I approached them , they said they could n't remember the exact words that were dictated .
Another team used the words to make sentences that were unrelated to the story .
The chairs were placed in a U shape , which made it difficult for team members to discuss their ideas and to maintain eye contact .
Ss did n't know how much time they had to finish the task .
Of course , I originally went there to work : putting the chairs and tables right , ensuring that everyone in my appointed space was well fed , and keeping an eye on the cash counter .
But I realise now that it 's quite late already and that I ought to sleep . I 'll write the rest to you as soon as I can ; I haven't told you the best part yet !
Given the learning experiences in the past two year s ' school - based support , some sound teaching strategies have been developed and these include the provision of adequate language inputs , ELPS and Thinking Tools .
All of the above have been making good progress in developing the P.1 - 4 school - based mathematics curriculum while there is still an area for development in the P.5 & 6 mathematics curriculum .
In view of these favourable conditions , higher expectations could be set to improve the learning process and enhance the learning performance of NCS .
More collaborative efforts should be made to make use of the sound teaching strategies with the aim of improving the learning performance of NCS .
Given the experience gained in the support services , many mathematics teachers have been equipped with necessary skills in identifying the learning needs of students and developing effective strategies for teaching NCS .
The research done in this field has provided new mechanisms that give the impression of being an alternative to yield the necessary amount of crops for humans . Unfortunately , there is no evidence of GMC 's being completely safe for human consumption .
It might be a cause of concern that all the research done has been under the control of private corporations that deny full access to experiment reports , leaving a cluster of questions without any answer .
Companies like Monsanto that engineer plants with sterile seeds , encourage non - sustainable production models that promote the extinction of independent farmers who have to choose between their lifestyle and the new farming era .
The Monopolistic and monopsonic features shown in GMC companies establish that the research done in this field has nothing to do either with science or with technology and even less with global food security .
In their quest for the perfect seed , genetic engineers have strengthened crops that are destroying the seeds ' biodiversity , as stand by research led by Greenpeace , GMC crops are threatening to human health because they present more toxic traces than non - modified crops .
It is worth mentioning that we never know the impact that scientific research and harvesting techniques are going to have on our lives , but the fate of those improvements depends on the application that humans give them .
A survey was carried out in the most populated Italian cities and 2000 citizens were interviewed on 22nd October to quantify their interest in this segment of the national TV schedule with the following results :
• 40% of those interviewed , most of whom have proven to be young people , declared that they watch English - language TV programmes at least five times a week ;
• 30% of them stated that they watch them at most twice a week , but they would do so more often if they were subtitled ;
Although the importation of such programmes has had positive effects , such as the introduction of new perspectives on different aspects of life , it has also had negative outcomes .
I would therefore suggest that local products be protected and valorised , to be able to respond to the threat represented by low - price imported ones .
An intelligent person once said : ' The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page . '
I totally agree with this statement and , to my mind , people should travel a lot , because our world is incredible .
Even just in cities , let alone travelling long distances .
But , on the other hand , a traffic jam or bad weather can make our trip inconvenient .
Not everyone can afford to travel by car every day , so they choose public transport .
Cars pollute our air , which leads to many diseases such as asthma , allergies and even cancer .
So , my advice is to travel by bicycle ( or at least , use public transport ) , because it is environmentally friendly !
The difference in work meetings between the British and French are that the British want to make decisions and the French like a debate way more , as is written in a guide to Franco - British business relationships .
This is in contrast to the guide " Light at the End of the Tunnel : Practical Reflections on the French and British in Business " published by the French chamber of commerce in Great Britain .
The booklet published in 1944 by the UK 's Foreign Office , " instructions for British Servicemen in France " is still useful for most , nowadays .
The late actor , Louis de Funès , is mentioned as a role model by the chamber of commerce 's guide .
When you get hired by a British employer , it will be because of your experience or achievements as a leader in sports .
In France , the level of education is the main reason for hiring someone .
The British do n't say what they are thinking , in contrast to the Dutch .
In 1995 , the French came to notice that their language was n't enough for doing business worldwide .
This is one of the reasons why most French under 50 do n't speak English very well .
International relationships are built by people who can speak the same language and who are at the same level in their vocabulary .
The native speakers seek each other out ; the British get together with the Americans , and the French , well … they are on their own .
If the French and British spoke the same language equally , trade would go up by 44 per cent .
It 's no use teaching French in schools , because the French only accept near native speakers .
It 's better to talk English and force it on them .
I live in a small town called Grycksbo and I 've been part of Unga Kris volunteering programs since the summer of 2010 .
Now that I have been volunteering for a while , my expectations have changed : Unga KRIS is still a place where I expect to have fun and meet new people , but I also expect to grow even more as a person , to take on responsibilities and face my fears in different social situations . »
In many cases , volunteers are crucial to helping support life , as when meals are delivered to housebound people .
It 's something that is part of our growth to adulthood .
When I was nineteen , I started and ran my own business . For me , it was one of the most exciting choices that I made .
Of course , without the full support of my family , I could n't have done it .
At first , I found it an exhilarating and rewarding challenge , although it was a modest shop .
But it was n't enough . The fact of the matter was that I did n't realise that being self - employed entailed self - sacrifice , devoting my time , energies and a great deal of patience to the customers , it was so hard !
Things gradually improved day by day for a time and my revenues started growing .
So I did n't mind working against time and for long hours .
During the next ten years , I was thrilled about the fact that I was able to put aside money in order to build our flat step by step .
When I got married , things quickly went from bad to worse because I had to work two shifts , at home and the shop .
As a matter of fact , Budapest , the capital city of Hungary , could be a very good competitor for hosting this sporting event .
Buda castle is an impressive ancient picturesque building and an attractive tourist location .
The obsolete trams and trolleys have been replaced .
Bicycle trails criss - cross the city .
2 . ) Airport Hotel is the closest accommodation to the Liszt Ferenc airport .
The admission tickets to most of Budapest 's museums are comparatively cheap .
The main concern is related to petty crime , especially pickpocketing .
In addition , homeless people have to sleep in the street .
The government should renovate the buildings , which would be great shelters for homeless people .
The police chief should reinforce their patrol officers to tackle crime .
In conclusion , it would be a good idea and a viable way is through sponsorship .
Moreover , this would be advantageous both for the host city and the tourists .
I had just graduated from the Academy and was on my summer holidays .
By that time I had attended six interviews , but nobody was interested in my candidacy .
I decided to go to my parents ' and spend a few weeks helping them with the renovation of their house .
At first , I did not understand anything and I had decided that it was a mistake .
But then I remembered that when I was 15 I 'd sent my scientific work to the Patent service .
It turned out that they sent my work to a few institutes and one of them was interested in me .
That day was the start of my scientific career .
In 50 years ' time , maybe not all of the natural resources will have been used up , but most of them then will have been exploited .
I 'm completely certain that 50 years from now we will still be living on Earth , although our lifestyles will have changed a lot .
So , is it really worth getting away from it all and setting off on a journey around the world or getting their first job ?
Moreover , they feel they have to make the most of their time , to become a university graduate and get a life in what they really love .
Therefore , they choose a job that is related to a hobby or sport so that they can learn from it and earn money at the same time .
To my mind , gaining experience of any kind and taking a gap year before plunging into applying for a university course will broaden young people 's perspective on life and will help them become more confident about what they really love .
If they are lucky , they may end up working in another country or their hobby could become their career .
I learned somewhere that the best thing to make a path through your writing is to start typing .
I 'm not sure if this is true or not , because I 'm not here to judge or comment on the authenticity of the statement , but rather , I 'm here to make my path through writing .
How can someone know they have got the talent ?
How can they know they have the guts ? What I believe , and I think it 's true , is that courage , boldness and callousness make people write truly what they think , without any lies , without any camouflage and without any kind of burnished layers .
Writers often make their masterpieces shiny and glowing in order to make them more acceptable to people , less shocking to them and less close to the reality from which readers had the intention of escaping when they picked that piece of writing in the first place .
Thus , bad personality can be the seed of crime .
On the other hand , I would argue that poverty can be the major catalyst of criminality .
This means that a number of offenders can not sustain their livelihood , and they desperately experience limited options for earning money .
As a result , they are easily attracted by the allure of wealth , which leads to illegal activities such as theft , kidnapping or drug trafficking .
Big cities such as Hanoi or New Delhi witness a growth in juvenile delinquency , which mostly stems from rural and underdeveloped areas .
In addition , the prevalence of media such as television or the internet is partially to blame .
This is particularly common among young people , who are unable to differentiate between fiction and reality .
In conclusion , although human nature is likely to be a cause of crime , I hold the position that crime occurs due to the media and poverty .
In the past , people used technology as a tool for making survival an easier endeavor .
Nowadays , we are witnessing a shift in the role technology is playing in our society and may continue to play for generations to come .
In the modern - day world technology is no longer a tool for survival but it has turned into a means of communication and entertainment .
At the same time , this raises the concern of whether technology has a good or bad influence on our society . Is the use of technology destroying face - to - face interaction and communication between people ?
Whenever you 're in a coffee shop , standing at a bus stop or taking the tube , you can easily see how people are connected to each other using different sorts of electronic devices .
The primary concern regarding this new communication behavior is whether it makes face - to - face interaction and communication between people nonexistent .
This is true in many respects as this may lead to living in a virtual world that only includes interacting with people through texting and social networks .
This leads , among other things , to the possibility for people to be lonely , as having too many virtual friendships causes an inability to establish meaningful relationships .
The young generation in our society are participating in a massive , unintentional social experiment the results of which are not entirely predictable .
Nowadays , society tends to prejudge others just because of their actions and without knowing the real motive of their behaviour .
But with Colton 's quotation , we can clearly see that it has happened for years .
In our current society , we can see it daily .
Lots of children get their hair cut like their favourite football player 's , others dress like their favourite actors and actresses or even adults act like their role models , just because they all do have something in common : they admire those people .
Flattery is different . It is easier to recognize .
Nowadays , in some specific cases , people , if they want to get a good position or be promoted , flatter .
When getting these jobs is not through civil service exams , I think there are only two ways : influence or flattery . And to be honest , I do n't know what I prefer .
To sum up , I would like to invite people who agree with the quotation to rethink their opinion because everything is not what it seems to be .
But there are some lines that are way too dangerous to cross .
If you 're willing to take the chance , the view from the other side is spectacular .
A way that no one ever seems to tell you about .
I am really interested in martial arts , such as Aikido , Judo and self - defense , which I have already practiced .
There are some that do not need too much energy and strengths , such as Thai chi , and others that need more , like Karate , Judo , and so .
The first advantage of martial arts is to improve self - confidence .
You will get ready to fight with others , regardless of their strength , age and so on .
When you use a technique successfully on your opponent , you feel more confidence .
The second advantage of doing martial arts is that you learn how to respect others .
Every time you use a technique you have to show your respect to your opponent , and also other ranks , regardless of their age .
The third one is movement and coordination between different parts of the body ; eyes , hands and legs .
When you use a technique or defend against a technique , you control your body 's movement and coordinate them to work at the same time .
Some people think there are some disadvantages , like injury , and getting aggressive .
People who practise martial arts are less aggressive because they practice controlling their inner energy , and also respecting others .
I suggest that everyone should try martial arts .
But before starting , you should evaluate your needs and your health .
The original work was written by the mathematician , logician and British writer Lewis Carroll .
The wonderland that is described in the book is created through logic games , and , therefore , the success it has achieved in the most varied environments is understandable .
The exceptional play that we saw yesterday features all the iconic characters adapted to some extent to the present time , such as , the White Rabbit , Mad Hatter , the blue caterpillar or the Queen of Hearts .
One of the biggest differences compared with the book is the atmosphere created on stage and the characterization of the characters .
The only negative comment I could make is that you do not have the possibility to use your imagination in the same way as when you read the book .
However , I strongly recommend going to see this play because it has a great appeal for both adults and children .
" Encourage learner autonomy - the teacher wo n't always be there to provide answers " . Alternatives to whole class feedback onestopenglish .
This lesson was the third trail of giving students written instructions and having them explain to their classmates what activities need to be done .
This time , in order to further reduce my TTT , I handed over the correction of activities to the students as well .
I hoped that by handing over complete control to the class , this would give them more chance to practice real world discussion and negotiation techniques .
The amount of talking done by the students was more than pleasing .
They enjoyed being the " boss " and telling other students what to do .
I had an exact copy of what the students had on their clue cards on a separate piece of paper this time , rather than in the lesson plan itself .
This made everything seem less cluttered and more manageable .
I highlighted anything that required action from me on my copy of the clues , e.g. handing a student the answers to an exercise .
Giving the students the answers to the exercises was a partially efficient way to encourage the students to speak more .
This is the first time I have tried this method and I neglected to leave the students extra time to be able to benefit fully from the exercise .
They enjoyed the exercise so much that my timing was completely off .
In hindsight , giving this much control to the class and introducing a new and tricky grammar point ( past modals ) was not the best choice .
The next time I do this lesson , I will use a more skills - based lesson with perhaps a listening or a short reading .
If grammar was part of the lesson , it would need to be a point that is being revised .
Despite having timing issues , I feel that , thus far , this was the class with the most natural student participation and the lowest amount of TTT .
I thoroughly enjoyed the lesson and , according to student feedback , so did they .
It 's a city where you can recreate a part of European history , thanks to the ancient and magnificent buildings , and where you can enjoy the latest technology and have fun .
I suggest visiting the Vatican , as I said at the beginning ; the country inside the city .
Inside it , we can find the well known Sistine chapel . I ca n't tell you what it 's like , because last year when I went , there was a changeover of pope , and it was closed and I could n't enter .
On the other hand , there are more places to visit , like the Coliseum or something else .
Whatever happens , I 'm sure you 'll enjoy the city .
Furthermore , if you go in summer , you should go to a lively area and be with the interesting and nice people , but like every city , be careful in the rough areas .
Despite people 's opinions , if you have the opportunity to go , do n't throw it away , and check it out for yourself .
Like the majority of you , I have friends who are still around me since many years ago , although we do n't see each other regularly , others have simply slowly become less important and some , luckily , have recently entered my life .
Without any doubt , a good friend is a treasure .
Counting on someone capable of understanding your needs , who shares with you their innermost feelings and who is able to discuss possible misunderstandings , is totally rewarding .
As the saying goes , " A friend in need is a friend indeed " .
If you respect your friends , then they will respect you .
In other words , no matter how far away you live , a good friend will always support you .
Curiously , you never know where you will find a friend and every stage of your life brings you the opportunity to take advantage of new people who maybe go to the same sports lessons as you or simply work in the same company .
It is surprising the amount of nice people around you sometimes , and it is a question of spending some time to realize that you now have new friends .
As I said before , every moment in your life is different as your friends probably are too .
Hi ! How are you ? Have you found your car keys ?
Or have they run away ?
I wanted to write to you earlier , but we had my sisters ' birthday party and I had an allergic reaction to something I 'd never eaten before .
At first , we did n't know what it was from , then I realized that the cake had blueberries , and I 'd never eaten one before .
After we ate the cake , I found my mom looking at me and screaming : " Oh !
I did n't know what was happening , and why they were acting like that .
Suddenly , I felt my whole body itching me and mom took me upstairs .
When I looked in the mirror , my face was spotted with red spots and it kind of turned purple , when I looked at my hands and my arms , they were all red from my fingers when I was scratching them , and the parts that were n't red , they were spotted like my face .
Anyways , mom gave me a medicine ( I do n't know what it is ) , and a cream for my arms and hands because they were turning blue .
And do n't be afraid , I 'm okay , and I decided to check everything for blueberries .
What is the experience of learning another language like ?
The learning of our mother tongue is a long - term process that everyone has to be involved in .
However , anyone who is skilled in speaking a foreign language has a huge advantage in a competitive and global society .
On the one hand , I have been learning English for so long that my good proficiency has given me the chance to get a position in an international team .
On the other hand , I have learned French and Spanish just for a few months , because I was curious to learn the official language of the countries where friends and relatives are living .
I am only able to read simple worksheets and to make a brief presentation about myself .
As a student of these classes , especially , of English , I realized that , although the classes were important , systematic language practice was essential for reaching an advanced level and , moreover , for maintaining it .
Nevertheless , learning another language has many benefits , such as the ability to live in and visit countries with different languages , meeting foreign people , working in an international environment , reading books or websites in other languages , etc .
Bauer 's fourth novel is an originally surprising thriller which includes an astonishing view of Asperger 's syndrome from the perspective of Patrick , a trainee medical student .
At the tender age of 18 and coping with his eccentric social code and all the possible courage , Patrick moves from his mother 's house to a rented flat in Cardiff to pursue his greatest dream ; work in the Anatomy Department at Cardiff University .
The writer lets us observe the fear , anxiety and the defencelessness of Sam , a neurological patient who is just beginning to emerge from his comatose state and who has yet to deal with the reality of his new situation , sorting out pieces of memories involving relatives and not quite understanding why a woman he does n't know anything about claims to be his wife .
Patrick performs the autopsy of Sam brilliantly and finds out shocking information which leads the reader to the discovery of tragic and incidental deaths of neurological patients involving doctors , nurses and patients ' relatives .
In this task , Patrick will be helped out by Lexi , the daughter of his autopsy corpse , to throw some light on the creepy suspicion of medical mistreatment and its darkest consequences .
Everything started with some attacks here and there , but no one really knew what was happening , so the attacks were tagged as " animal attacks " .
But when they became more frequent and witnesses described huge , furry , dark and terrifying creatures with blood - shot eyes , panic grew in the population .
Government authorities told people to stay calm and a curfew was established , but Peter was on a camping holiday with his best friends and only heard this when they met another group of people who , fortunately , had a radio .
In order to be stronger in number , they befriended those people and they helped each other .
The new group worked very well together , but there was this girl he just could n't stand at all .
" It 's the end of the world , and I have to spend it with you ? " he whispered . The night had already fallen and they did n't want any unwanted visitors .
I 'm 23 years old and love to cook and I also love to be outdoors and play sports with the kids , I love organizing activities for children and actually playing with them . I 'm always cheerful and in a great mood . I do n't smoke or drink . I have a good level of spoken English and I 've always been hardworking and energetic .
I 'm also very good at first aid , so if someone is hurt , I 'm very helpful with that too . I can do pretty much anything that you want me to . I love all kids and I love spending time with them , I love playing outside and caring for all the children .
Overall , I just love children .
Dear Paul , you are right , it is really a brave step but you know how terrible the situation in Italy is and I have decided to come to the UK to improve my CV as well .
At the moment I am struggling with the translation of my CV .
I am wondering if you could help me by giving me some tips to write a perfect , of at least acceptable , CV .
I have just found cheap accommodation in a hostel which is very convenient for all the facilities .
Even though I am shy and I like my privacy , I think that during this experience it will be better to have contact with foreign people to practise my spoken English as much as possible .
Now , let 's talk about the good things .
The aim of this experience is also to have fun and a great time with you .
For example , what about going for some walks in the countryside or renting a bike ?
I know that the countryside is really lovely there .
OK , I have told you everything and I really should finish packing !
I am rather lazy as a person . I ca n't say I really enjoy sports in general , but I definitely love walking .
I think it 's so effective : having a long walk in the green hills that surround my town , breathing deeply , enjoying the perfume of nature and the wonderful sights and colours of flowers and trees , it 's the best way for me to clear my mind .
There 's no special advice to give to somebody who wants to start this activity : if you aim to do something good for your health and for your mind , just wear comfortable clothes , put a pair of trainers on , choose the most inspiring place and just go and enjoy every minute of it .
I would recommend 30 mins per day , to get the most out of this activity : it does n't take up too much of your spare time and you 'll get great benefits from it .
It 's very cheap as well : apart from your jumpsuit and a pair of comfortable trainers , it does n't require any extra cost for technical or sophisticated equipment .
I think this will be a very good experience for you because you can learn about another culture and another people 's way of thinking .
So , I suggest you try to get a working holiday visa for Korea .
As you know , if you have a normal tourism visa , you ca n't work .
In Korea , we have many kinds of work which are related to English , so you can get a job easily .
Also , if you want to work a in more specific place , such as an electricity company , public office and so on , you can apply to an internship programme .
If you get the internship , you can work as a real businessman .
In summer , you can enjoy many activities on the beach and you can also go hiking .
In particular , I strongly recommend you go to Jeju Island .
It is the most popular place that people want to go to .
If you want to know more information about Korea , let me know , and I do n't mind checking your plan to go to Korea .
It was a winter 's night .
Not only was it going to change my life , but also another person 's life .
When we arrived at the police station , I met an officer called Michael .
Nevertheless , the police had found the buried body .
Michael asked me where I had been at the time of the crime and I told him that I had been at home having a rest with a friend who could bear out the alibi .
During the interview , I realised the different ways I could use to get away if I were alone .
Fortunately , Michael , who had n't thought of that option , left the interrogation room .
With over two hundred thousand dollars in his bag , he was a giant walking target .
Ragged and worn , it certainly had seen better days .
Travelling further down he found his destination , a small steep staircase covered in dust and shrouded in a mist like fog .
A police officer 's car was zooming in his direction , sirens blaring .
To begin with , I think that most people use their car to go to work and also when they go on holiday or to get around the city or town because they feel free and do n't have to pay attention to a timetable .
But , on the other hand , when they travel abroad , it 's easier to take a train or a plane because you arrive faster and you need n't find a place to park your car and , if you want to go somewhere , you can take a taxi or a bus or even the underground .
Anyway , I do n't think public transport has no future , but public transport is used on different occasions than before and when you go to a place you know you wo n't be able to find a place to park and you ca n't waste time looking for where to park .
To make bank notes , the first step is to properly design them .
While background color and artwork are thoroughly considered , security issues are one thing that we can not overlook either .
After this , metal plates need to be prepared by skilled machinists so as to proceed to bank note printing , in which stage sheets are used to print ( each containing 50 bank notes ) .
Also , special ink is printed on both sides of the sheet and the images are slightly raised .
Sheets in the second group then get separated into good ones , which , together with good quality sheets , enter a process of packaging and distribution where separate notes are cut and finally enter the market , and bad ones , which go to disposal with bad quality sheets , where both groups get securely destroyed .
This leads us to the conclusion that the process of bank note creation is secure as well as simple .
My boyfriend is the best in the entire round world .
I met him two years ago at a party , and since that day my life has changed in many different ways .
When I first saw him , I never imagined that I would love that stranger this way .
I have many memories with him , which I always keep in my heart even if they are good or bad .
One of them was the day we went to a concert by our favourite DJ . We had so much fun , we danced , kissed and sang like never before that night .
I loved it .
Nowadays , we are still together , and we are as happy as in our beginning .
As a secret I can tell you that I want to marry him so badly , I swear to god that my life would be much better if I could live all of it with him .
" It 's time for us to shine , " His handwritten words came to life in her mind .
She could distinctly hear his low , manly voice in her head .
His deep chuckles still gave her butterflies in her stomach .
Every movement seemed to take a minute to execute .
The person was holding her wrist , preventing her from wiping any sweat from her face .
Wide eyes , red lips , rosy cheeks , broad build and a little stubble on his chin , he looked incredible .
Those blue eyes , were much darker with insecurity , doubt and mystery .
Her eyes gazed at his lips .
He must have applied some lipstick for them to be that red !
She knows , she knows and she knows it is so wrong to put all happiness , dreams and hopes on someone that may leave anytime , but she could not help it .
First of all , let me tell you the advantages .
Next , we could ask our community for help . I have some books in my library I could donate .
I have them because I have paid for them , not for any other particular reason .
In conclusion , we should provide free books for our students .
I am writing to express my very strong interest in and motivation to work in one of the largest and most professional companies in the world , such as your company .
You will find me to be a reliable person who has a professional , calm and honest approach to all work - related matters .
Technically minded and with good problem - solving skills , I am able to work effectively in fast - paced and ever - changing environments .
Additionally , I would like also to point out some of my personal qualities and values that I believe are extremely important in this profession , such as very high motivation to learn and educate more in this field , great responsibility and reliability . Furthermore , I am also very dedicated to achieving any planned results and goals as well as having well developed communication skills etc .
Given my related experience and excellent abilities , I would appreciate your consideration for any available or appropriate position according to my education and skills .
My CV , which is enclosed , includes additional information on my experience and skills .
The streets were calm and the lights were pleasant . Travelling at night was a pleasure in this town .
" So here we are " he said , looking upward . "
We 'd better do our exam as soon as we can . "
They moved in the crowd that made various phone calls and talked about their busy lives .
She looked around , making faces at everyone around her .
" You have to do your duty here too , remember ? We made progress back in the other city . "
She nodded and made another effort to look around .
Who could it be ?
As usual , they were talking about illegal things .
They got closer to the man .
The other person was n't convinced , however .
They talked for hours . One trying to convince the other . He was doing his best , but in the end , the other man declined .
When he finished talking , he looked at the young couple in front of him .
" What are you doing here , pests ? !
" He made sure his voice was heard on the streets , to reaffirm his social position .
The young couple grinned . " You haven't heard about the mind hackers , right ? "
He gasped and tried to scream , but it was too late to run .
She looked on her laptop , where all the information in that man 's mind was displayed .
" Bingo . We got a code . "
She searched the man , looking for an ID . She took it and as soon as they got it , they let the man go . He fainted and will not remember anything that happened to his mind .
The couple of thieves made their way to the main building .
They entered the building with the aid of the ID and made use of the code to enter the interior of the building .
They went up to the receptionist .
" Are you two the people who will do their skill test ? "
The couple nodded and showed the ID of the man from the other city .
The receptionist nodded and conducted both to the main hall .
It was disturbing , as kids were also included .
One of the bosses in charge of such things .
She felt somehow nervous . " I know we are doing this to escape this inferno , but ... I have a bad feeling about this . " But it was too late .
They walked in to find a man looking out of the window .
" You two are finally here . I know who you are . "
It was impossible . They deleted every bit of information about themselves .
" Did you think you two were going to make fun of me? ... "He pushed her backwards .
" Welcome to your tombstone , hackers . "
Just as a coin has two sides , television , too , has its pros and cons .
Of late , debates on news channels are the talk of the town where you get to know what is happening in your country or neighborhood .
Such programs also allow us to participate by giving our feedback .
Gone are the days when Tom mindlessly chased Jerry .
These days , we have many educational cartoons that teach kids how to draw , make crafts and even learn languages .
The home of the future will look more or less the same as the home of the present .
Even today , processors are in almost every device : dishwashers , vacuum cleaners , television sets , even blenders .
It may sound silly , but I think it actually will make those devices more user - friendly and functional .
Even now , we can buy TV sets with an Internet connection , so development of technology is not a problem .
But we have to ask ourselves , why would we connect every device in our house to the World Wide Web ?
Imagine you could program your house to welcome you after a long day at work .
You come back and dinner is cooked , all your favourite programmes are recorded and ready to watch , your bath is full of hot water and you can just relax .
Reassuming , while the design of houses may look different , the most significant change will be in technology , which will make our life easier .
It has already done this , but we still ca n't see an end to the possibilities .
Firstly , I would like to say that I have some experience of looking after children because I worked at a local summer camp last summer .
As for my personality , I would like to mention that I am a funny person who enjoys telling jokes , making people laugh and even getting dressed up as a clown to entertain others .
If you require any further information , I am available for an online interview .
It 's no secret that there has been a decline in the use of transport such as taxis ever since cars became more affordable and your common Joe became capable of keeping one , two or more per family . However , does that really mean that the future of public transport like buses is hopeless ?
Many affordable bus and metro passes and other systems have also been created in order to motivate the citizens to use them , providing a quicker , and sometimes cheaper , alternative to their own transport .
Nothing was distracting his attention .
It was n't only the smile , but the way she talked to him , the look in her eyes and her flirty attitude that had filled his stomach with tiny butterflies and , as he was going home , he started to realize the love running through his veins , right to the heart .
He took the keys from his pocket and approached carefully , holding his breath .
If you are a fan of romantic films , you probably wo n't like this movie . " Palmeras en la nieve " is a Spanish film based on a book written by Luz Gabas which is about the life of a Spanish man who goes to Bioko to work and he falls in love with a native woman .
The problem with this movie is not the story , because the book is fantastic and when you read it , you really can feel the emotions of the characters .
Furthermore , the main actors ' performance is not very good because they are not completely inside their roles .
An example of that is the extremely amazing soundtrack with a really beautiful song by Pablo Alboran , a Spanish singer .
Other good features are the costumes and the landscapes , which give the movie a very realistic image and carry the spectators to that time .
It 's been a long time since we last contacted each other .
It 's an activity that you need to do every day , since it 's a good way to keep fit .
The majority of people think of sport as a way to relax , to get thin , or to keep fit .
It is in these moments that I give it my all and realize that all the practice I had really paid off .
This is why I suggest people give swimming a try .
I believe you should be fully informed about the quality of the services in the advertisements you publish , as your readers could be negatively biased against your paper due to such incidents .
Generally , the holiday as a whole was good enough , as the most important -in my opinion- aspects , like the quality of the guided tours and the accommodation , were very high .
The first day was a great shock to me as I realized I would be part of a group .
Spending holidays with a group can be very convenient and , for some people , is the only way of travelling , but the advertisement did not state clearly that it concerned this particular type of holiday , which made me and some others feel deceived .
Much time lost could have been saved with a few phone calls . For example , waiting for half an hour in a queue could have been prevented if a call had been made to the museum before we arrived there .
There are six main characters : Ross , Monica , Rachel , Chandler , Phoebe and Joey .
On the other hand , Joey and Chandler live together .
Joey is an actor and he is always having auditions but without success .
And Chandler works in an office , but he does n't really like his job .
Phoebe is the funniest of the group . She sings and plays the guitar , but she is not very good at it .
Rachel and Monica have lived together since Rachel left her fiance at the altar .
She works in a restaurant as the head chef and she 's dating a man twenty years older than her .
The six friends might not have the same opinions , they might argue , they might get angry with each other , but they always forgive and forget !
In my opinion , young people will love this show .
To sum up , I really recommend you to see it . You 'll love it .
I really recommend this movie , but if you plan to watch it with your family , I do have to tell you that there is a lot of blood and killing in the film .
I can easily give it a five star rating , because all of the events that happen seem real in the movie , and they are events that could happen in real life .
Without a doubt , all parents want their children to be model citizens .
However , raising a child into a model citizen is extremely hard work .
On one hand , parents should take responsibility for their children 's education as they are a child 's first contact .
Also , parents are like models to follow for their children , and as children do what they see , they will copy their parents ' actions .
Indeed , school is the first place where a children interacts with society .
Ultimately , teachers may have different values from those of the parents .
On the other hand , parents may have a lack of time to spend with their children due to demanding jobs and to provide everything that their children need , for example , pay for their children 's school .
It can also be argued that children spend most of their time at school and not at home , making it the school 's responsibility to pass on good social values .
To sum up , parents should take full responsibility for their children 's education .
However , one should take into account that a school with similar values to those of the parents would be a great help in the child raising process .
I am writing with regard to the advertisement published by you , to work in summer camps in the USA .
I would like to take part in this experience during the summer , as I will have my summer break during that period .
I have taken part in a volunteer programme , looking after children 6 - 12 during the school term , and therefore , I consider myself as having good knowledge of children 's behaviour , which might be useful for the summer camp .
I am a cheerful , energetic and hardworking person , and I am also a very responsible person , able to deal with small and medium groups of children , and for this reason I consider myself as suitable for the position advertised .
I am looking forward to taking part in this project , and enriching my CV through participation in this project .
Looking forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience .
Yours faithfully ,
Everything in this movie , Henri , is so simple and startling , but at the same time hard to describe .
As time passes by , the relationship has so many ups and downs , but with consistent love and care , it ends with a strong bond that is n't easily broken .
In France , where the film was made , they call the handicapped , " White Butterflies " , which is definitely a better nomenclature than " People With Special Needs " and so many disrespectful names .
The only reason I want to recommend this movie to you is because I want you to forget about all the action , thrills , money - making or good fighting evil .
My sole purpose is to help you enjoy the little things in your lives , appreciate life and its simplicity with all its hidden fun and sad parts as well .
Unlock the door to a new life and kick off your journey toward a whole new group of characters .
Chase the childish dream of visiting a foreign country and getting to know new aspects of life .
Check out how ordinary people , just like you and me , live each and every day , share their grief and problems , join them in their happy moments , get involved in their lives and be passionate and compassionate .
The aim of this report is to briefly describe the main strengths and weaknesses of the course " Good design using DTP " , to give an overall view of it .
The course took place at the Training center in Regent Street , London , on the 14 - 15 of May , as scheduled .
All the participants , which were ten in total , were given a personal computer for the duration of the entire course , in order to put into practice what was taught .
The tutor , Will Reeves , a lecturer of the University of Cambridge , succeeded in covering the whole program in an extremely effective way .
To begin with , he focused on design considerations with DPT , explaining what software to use , and then he went on to tell us about typography and fonts , layout and balance , as well as graphics and logs .
He concluded the course by making color considerations and showing proofing and printing .
The highpoint , however , was the final practical exercises , which gave us the opportunity to test our comprehension .
Not only was the venue inconvenient , but it was also dirty .
The general dissatisfaction was perceived by the lecturer too , who pointed it out to the organizers , who immediately started looking for an alternative venue .
In addition , in spite of having paid a lot , the participants were not allowed to take any materials away , and this resulted in obtaining a less effective result , as the participants did n't have any materials to use to revise .
In conclusion , we would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in this subject , for both the quality of the course and the unquestionable preparation of the tutor .
Nowadays , many countries have ruined areas of farmland , forest and wetland with the intention of constructing housing and transport networks to cater for the needs of people .
There are many problems created by doing large - scale building projects , and it is the government 's responsibility to deal with these problems .
There are some unfavorable influences on people 's lives .
Because of the damage to farmland , forest and wetland , it is likely to lead to the pollution of water and air , which can cause a decrease in people 's quality of life .
For example , in some areas , people have to wear a mask while doing outdoor activities and they might need to purchase water from other towns .
As a result , their lifestyle can be negatively affected and thus they will feel less happy than other people living in unpolluted areas .
The damage to wildlife habitats has an affect on animals in a negative way .
They have to migrate to another place since their homes are destroyed , and during the migration most of them will die because of lack of water , high temperatures or predators .
Besides , those animals who successfully arrive in a suitable place to live are likely to suffer from disease , because they haven't been exposed to such a new environment before .
Although there are many people and animals that are suffering from these problems , I do believe that the government can take some actions to solve them .
Firstly , laws should be created to forbid some projects which cause massive problems for the environment .
Secondly , it is necessary for the government to warn people about the serious problems caused by constructing large - scale buildings .
To summarise , large - scale building projects create massive problems which are harmful to humans and animals , but the government can be helpful in solving these problems .
First of all , on the English course which I did at the HZ , I learned and improved my writing in many ways .
I would like to answer some questions from the guidelines on Moodle , to explain how this course helped me to improve my English .
And the other questions : which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations help me with my writing process ?
From my point of view , my writing has definitely improved since the beginning of this school year .
Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations help me with my writing process ?
More words can be added to the article , so there can be a better explanation of the subject .
I learned a lot of new words during the presentations which I used in my free writing .
To finish , I can conclude that this English course has been very useful to me , because it has improved my English a lot
The way I see it is that the grammatical features learned on the English course , can always be used later on in life .
For example , when letters have to be sent in English .
This is because all people dream of a better future .
Among them , a private means of transportation suggests that there is no future for public transport .
It is already in practice in the western world .
Having your own car or means of transportation is the dream of every individual , including me .
One private car per individual is needed .
Whether to go to work or other places , travelling in a private vehicle is hassle free .
It saves a lot of our time .
The trend of personal car ownership is increasing rapidly .
We can not deny that there will be a time when no person will want to travel by bus or train .
It is so clear that private transport will overshadow public vehicles .
Everybody knows about the big problem that our society has with domestic abuse .
But most of us just from a distance ; we really do not imagine how this can affect people who suffer from it .
Unfortunately , many people are damaged , not only physically but mentally , and the worst is that violence destroys families and also involves the children in the hell it causes .
Children quite often feel guilty of not being able to prevent these problems or help their mothers to escape from them and tend to think they are doing something wrong when they obviously are not .
It is very serious and hard to solve , because victims have to be very strong and brave to recognize and face these situations and be able to report their aggressor so as to manage the matter finishes .
In most cases , they even feel ashamed or afraid of these situations and prefer saying nothing to telling the truth .
All those people who are living with this abuse have to know that they are really important and deserve to be happy and free and they are not alone .
There are many people who worry about them and are willing to help and support them .
There is always someone who you can count on among your family , friends or associates , but you must ask for help .
There are many reasons for using public transport , such as commuting into the central business district .
However , public transport use can be affected by a number of factors such as mechanical failures and environmental issues .
Using a car can be more flexible for some individuals .
I think there is a role for both modes of transport after taking into account all of the above reasons .
The reasons for use are dependent on the individual and the circumstances .
It 's one of the best Al Pacino films and it 's very different from previous ones .
First of all , in this film you do n't see a gangster Al Pacino . It 's about a retired army colonel who suffers from loneliness and depression .
It 's worth seeing because a young boy , Charlie , helps him get through his sadness on a very luxurious trip to New York .
However , the drama is perfectly achieved in each scene and they keep you glued to the screen .
So , overall , I strongly recommend it if you like redemption stories , and if you want to learn some pieces of advice for your life .
The text discusses the idea of how advanced communication technologies give us the advantage of creating a 24/7 international working day and provides several reasons to support this .
The first point the professor addresses involves the text 's assertion that creating two or three teams situated in different geographical locations will help reduce the work hours for each team and , at the same time , will decrease the timeframe for getting the project done .
The professor refutes this point of view by saying that , based on his own experience , this team work could be not so beneficial .
For instance , some group could have questions , but it would not be able to ask the other group because they would be sleeping at that time .
Therefore , the working group will make its own assumptions and may cause a waste of time .
Moreover , the group in California may do work in one way and a group in India do the same work differently , so it will be challenging to bring both of them to the same way of getting things done .
Another point from the article that the professor opposes is the claim that telecommunication helps to solve many problems that physical separation would cause for businesses .
The professor points out that holding virtual meetings between teams in different timeframes will be challenging .
For example , one of the team will have to stay late in order to talk to another group , causing inconvenience .
These variables include internal and external cultural aspects .
These variables influence the behavior of employees .
The model distinguishes three kinds of expected performances : individual- , group- , and organizational performances .
The researchers found that there is a big difference between what the boardroom preach and what the employees experience .
More and more people nowadays try to find some ways of relaxing , due to the fast pace of life and stress .
Smoking appeals to many people of different generations , because it gives fast relief for a short period of time . That is also quite reasonable .
It 's a fact that tobacco has been used as a light drug for centuries by people of different nationalities .
Moreover , tobacco contains a vitamin , called PP1 that is beneficial for your health .
It also helps to overcome some stressful situations , even though it 's temporary , it 's still beneficial for your heart , rather than being constantly stressed .
Finally , smoking is a personal choice of freedom for everyone .
On the other hand , smokers sometimes do n't even realize that their children or relatives become passive smokers too .
So if your habits can be harmful for them , you need to understand the cost of it .
For the same reason , the government needs to control the situation by using a banning strategy if people smoke in certain forbidden ares , like kindergartens , schools , hospitals , etc .
In my opinion , people need to have freedom to make decisions on their own , but as soon as it starts to be a threat to others , they should be stopped immediately .
Madrid is a huge city which offers a lot of recycling facilities that take care of the environment .
There is a great public transport system .
Old clothes , books and toys in good condition can be passed on to charity shops .
It could be an example for other cities of how to help and conserve our planet .
Over the past few decades , human activities have changed the global climate , hence we are facing higher risks of weather - related disasters .
Furthermore , various destructive disasters have struck the whole society with many negative effects , drawing the attention of citizens to catastrophes .
A natural disaster such as drought can be generally defined as one that has a far - reaching influence because of its long duration and wide scope .
One of the obvious reasons for weather - related natural disasters is global warming .
Moreover , the world 's uncontrollable population results in the demand for cars , industries and farming industries , that have contributed to greenhouse gases .
Because of human activities , the temperature of the sea 's surface and the atmosphere have been gradually increasing to a new level .
van Aalst ( 2006 ) pointed out that an increase of earth mean surface temperature of approximately 0.6 degrees has been explored over the past century , with the phenomenon which has been observed that land temperature has exceeded that of seas by a quicker speed ( p.6 ) .
In addition , most greenhouse gas emissions can affect the atmosphere for decades , which might cause marine monsoon inaccessibility to mainland resulting in low rainfall .
Another phenomenon that can be caused by global warming is the decrease of snow coverage in relation to glaciers melting ( van Aalst , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
Thus , it can be seen that global warming has accounted for a series of extreme weather phenomena .
Generally , the increase in temperature has resulted in a surge in hot days , and a decrease of cold days .
This will largely cause less soil water and precipitation .
The area as mid - continental will unquestionably become drier and have insufficient precipitation , which may make it more vulnerable to summer droughts ( van Aalst , 2006 , p.8 ) . "
In brief , there will be serious consequences as a result of less precipitation due to extreme weather .
The direct impact of prolonged drought is the reduction of incomes for farmers resulting from the decrease in output .
This can lead to a loss of profits upstream and downstream throughout the supply chain , which can produce directly negative impacts for producers , as reported by Bauman , Goemans , Pritchett and McFadden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .
Moreover , it creates colossal economic damage when the drought occurs : lives are lost , people and animals are forced to move to a new place , resources become unsustainable or even extinct ( Bergholt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .
Another stricken area is the social perspective , which has threatened the majority of the population .
Firstly , drought has caused farming in some of the areas , such as Africa where there is an underdeveloped infrastructure and a lack of abilities to react after an emergency .
Moreover , farming is one of the most crucial impacts of weather - related natural disasters , and it has caused a significant number of casualties for both mankind and animals .
Secondly , farming has also contributed to migration .
When the public suffers from natural disasters and there are no solutions , they are forced to leave their homes in order to move to a new place , which could affect the next generation that might face a multicultural society .
Consequently , drought has led to the severe social impacts of natural disasters .
In conclusion , catastrophes such as drought have had immense economic and social impacts .
Not only human beings but also all organisms are confronting the threat from climate - related natural disasters .
The fact is , natural disasters have changed people 's and animals ' living environment , bringing about a multitude of influences in both direct economic revenue of farmers and indirect effects on enterprise .
Additionally , climate change related to natural disasters also causes famine , which has caused deaths and forced people as well as animals to leave their homes . More seriously , the climate is continuingly changing and still contributing to natural disasters .
Perhaps I am doing a little wishful thinking .
It is too early , is n't it ?
It 's too early to talk about love at this age .
Everything seems to strange when you are fifteen and you are talking about love .
Well , that question has been going around in my mind for so many months .
To me , to fall in love , is to accept and admire those little things that exist in that human being .
So why bother loving someone who will never return that love ?
Their life will be happier when you cease to exist .
Yes , it hurts , but at the end of the day , almost everything in this world will make you bleed .
It will make you feel vulnerable , but that is life .
They will always love you based on your looks rather than your personality .
I am the chairman of the 2012 Metropolitan Medical Conference that is being held in Miami , Florida on July 5 , 2012 , and I would like to invite you to present your research on beta blockers . We would be delighted to listen to you discussing your work , and I hope you will also agree to run a short question - and - answer session after the presentation .
Additionally , Metropolitan Medical would be pleased to cover your travel and lodging expenses while you visit the conference , in addition to providing you with a per diem allowance .
Please reply with your answer as soon as you are able to , so that we can begin to arrange your travel .
Some people do not think of walking as a sport , they believe that a sport has to be a rough activity , one that leaves you overtired and sweating .
But in my opinion , a sport is any activity that requires a certain amount of physical activity , one that can help you to improve your health .
I enjoy walking because it allows you to do physical exercise and talk , look at the landscape or do other things at the same time .
If you are young , you could walk fast , if you are old or not especially fit , you could start walking at a slow pace and , with time , improve your performance .
I would like to give some advice to people who want to start walking : take your time , do not try to walk ten kilometers the first day . Try short walks first and every day increase the distance .
You will find yourself walking a little further and faster than the day before .
And if you do that , then , sooner or later , you will become a walking enthusiast .
It was a sunny day in April .
Everyone in the house was so excited about it , but not Michael .
He knew that soon he would have to face his most powerful enemy , the Easter Bunny .
He used to dream about him coming into his bedroom , laughing out loud , showing off his sharp teeth , threatening him with the most horrible punishments .
He was home alone baby - sitting his two - year - old sister .
All of a sudden , he heard somebody knocking at the front door .
He grabbed the phone to try to call his parents .
In a flash , his brain sent him a signal and he realized it was only a dream .
He decided it was time to face his enemy .
He put his hand on the handle and , without thinking too much , he opened the door .
He did n't have time to get scared because all that he was thinking was why he did n't wake up at once .
I think it is true that colour does influence our decision when we buy different things .
No doubt manufacturers know which colour is popular and fashionable in a particular season and , consequently , it means that things of this colour will sell well .
For instance , I have recently read that people who belong to the middle class prefer pink and green colours for some psychological reasons .
That is why the predominant colour in McDonald 's is red . Likewise , in some other cafes and restaurants .
For example , if I liked a thing , I would not think much about its colour or the colour of the shop where I found it .
Moreover , for many people , the main factor is the price of a thing and not its colour .
To sum up briefly , I would like to say that there is a special branch of psychology which investigates consumers ' tastes and factors which influence their choice .
Thus , we can conclude that colour is a powerful tool but , in the same way , manufacturers and retail companies should take into consideration other factors .
My friendship with Jessie started on the exciting first day of kindergarten .
We first met at the swings . She smiled and I knew we were going to be friends forever .
I asked her if she wanted a sweet and , timidly , she nodded .
When the break was over , we went hand in hand to our classroom .
We love doing sleepovers , watching movies and going on holidays together .
It is generally accepted that television provides us with by far the best and easiest way to stay in touch with the whole world , while relaxing on our sofa , taking some time off from our housework .
This is the innovation that such a worldwide medium brings to our society .
Anyway , I wonder whether it would be useful and able to increase our education and help us to be more critical towards life , rather than impose its power on us .
Recent research shows us why there is always an increasing number of children who are getting used to spending most of their afternoons in front of the television so as not to miss a new cartoon or a well - known film : they seem like they are unaware of the existence of documentaries , news and all the other educative programmes which today 's televisions are full of .
It has been suggested by some European governments to introduce televisions in schools to give the opportunity to discuss together current topics and problems , in order to learn something more about the world we are living in .
In view of the above arguments , I would suggest everyone cuts down on television in order to have more time to read newspapers daily .
In my opinion , there is a future for public transport .
Firstly , public transport is useful for people that can not afford a car and their work is far away from where they live .
Secondly , public transport is better for the environment than using cars because a bus has more space than a car and many people can go on a bus , thus decreasing the amount of pollution and helping the environment .
Lastly , if the use of public transport decreases drastically or stops , many people will be unemployed . They could not earn more money and buy cars for going from one place to another .
The Countries will have a crisis and this will probably lead to another World War .
That will be a complete disaster , because now we have nuclear weapons and we would destroy the world .
In conclusion , public transport is very important for every person in some way and without it everything would be a disaster .
Unless you get a job in that year , to keep you busy , or do something that keeps you focused and gives you a routine , you should n't take a year off at all .
Without the routine that studying gives you , with all the deadlines , the exams , and other stuff that force you to get things done , and , as a consequence , teach you to be a responsible person , which you will need to be when you get a job , you will simply be wasting one year of your life by taking a break .
One thing that I 've learned in my life is that you should never take a break from your everyday routine unless you really need to , due to fatigue or for some other physical or psychological reason , otherwise you will be , I repeat , just wasting time , time that you could be spending in a useful way , by getting something done , or improving yourself academically , intellectually or doing whatever you think can enrich your life .
I 've wasted so much time in my life that even I find it embarrassing .
I like to believe that , like the old Latin proverb says ( and I have already said this ) , there will be glory at the end to the man who endures hardships on his path .
Maybe one day I will experience the glory that awaits in high places those who walk through the narrow paths of life .
Regardless of what 's waiting for me at the end , I will never give up walking along those hard paths no matter how challenging and hard they may be .
This is some intimate stuff I 'm sharing with you , my teacher .
I hope you do n't think that sharing these thoughts with you makes you my new best buddy .
I am writing in reply to your advertisement published in the local newspaper for the vacancy of Junior Chef .
Moreover , I am currently undertaking a Chef Training Course which provides me with not only practical but also theoretical knowledge .
Furthermore , I always try to maintain a positive attitude towards my responsibilities and sort out any problem that may occur .
Yours faithfully ,
I was as happy as a lark but soon it would get dark .
My leg was injured and it was as painful as a thorn in the paw , after countless hours of crawling .
Leaning forward slowly , I started crawling slowly like a turtle along the slender hill ; I was on all fours !
After a long and tiring crawl , I needed to find a shelter where I could seek refuge from the chilling wind howling over my head unabated .
Suddenly I saw a small gap between two blocks of snowy hills just big enough for me to lie down in .
But before I knew it , I was asleep .
Looking down at the watch on my wrist , I realized it had been nearly a week since I survived the fall from the snowy cliff and now I had to go through this all alone with no improvement to my dire predicament .
I continued crawling on all fours while wondering , how much longer , Simon , till we meet again .
I never stopped praying throughout , in the hope that somehow , somewhere , someone would come along to rescue me .
As I was climbing downhill , I found myself getting blisters on my palms in a way I could have no control over .
The pain was excruciating but I just had to move on if I ever hoped to survive my ordeal !
As quickly as I could , I managed to get myself to the nearest leafless tree that I could find . I leaned my back against it to try to gain whatever support I could muster with the little energy that I had left in my body .
Emphatically , I reminded myself that I would n't have survived had it not been for God 's help !
With the pain , doubts , hunger all crashing down on me , I was about to give up my fight for survival .
A second thought crossed my mind , telling me that I would miss my family and my best friends !
I had to carry on fighting to stay alive !
Dear Madam ,
My name is Alexandra Kennedy .
I 'm 29 , and I have a 9-year - old daughter .
I was born in Russia , but have lived in many different countries around the world .
I have got a family of my own , so I am familiar with looking after children and taking care of them . I enjoy fitness and can easily help organise children 's sport activities .
I am also quite experienced in the kitchen . I am really into healthy nutrition and healthy cooking .
It is important for children to get healthy meals , especially in their early teenage years .
I wo n't be afraid of any sort of jobs . I am ready for an adventure !
She is a great woman ; hardworking , responsible , kind , friendly , intelligent and an amazing person .
She was my first teacher who taught me to repeat my first word and took my hand to take my first step .
I have fond memories from my childhood . She was always cheering me up when I was in sad or difficult times , even when she was not feeling well .
Due to the interest in protecting animals , people are eager to take part in organizations such as World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) , which is an international non - governmental organization working on issues regarding the conservation , research and restoration of the environment .
This is clearly seen when driving along the road and suddenly you see a bull or a cow in the middle of the road .
This may cause not only the animal 's death by being run over , but also the passengers ' death if the driver tries to stop and loses control of the car .
First of all , I would like to say that young people have worse health nowadays .
It is our fault because we have let the companies profit from our own sins .
We are made of flesh and it can be very difficult to resist temptation .
You should take a look at the things your children have within their reach .
Therefore , I issue a call to action .
Kateryna was born in 1988 in Siberia , RF , to a family of Ukrainian Tatars .
The art of writing letters along with painting colorful mandalas were taught her to by her grandmother .
A huge mirror in her bedroom made the child believe that one was able to travel through it anywhere .
She loved watching the printer at work producing numerous results of psychology tests , which she had just passed .
She graduated from high - school at the age of 15 .
By this time , she had been spending almost all her free time at the computer .
She devoted all her free time to experiments on linking her math homework with programming of a music equalizer .
She graduated from Kiev International University in 2009 .
Kateryna was frustrated with the classic film genre and started looking for possibilities for realization of experimental theoretical ideas in practice .
After taking part in numerous festivals and concerts , she finally entered a joint British - Russian program for training socio - cultural managers in the cultural sphere .
The sport that I like most is dancing .
It may sound weird or even wrong to some people , because there are many that do n't even consider dancing as a sport ... but for me , and for everyone that has ever done dancing , it is not only a sport , but a very difficult one .
Dancing requires a lot of things , like coordination , flexibility , and physical fitness , just to mention a few .
But despite how hard dancing can be , it is also really fun , and that 's actually what makes me enjoy it most .
However , I would advise people who would like to start dancing to really take it seriously , because even though I said it was fun , it really does require commitment and discipline .
The influence of grown - ups : great or not so great ?
Recently I listened to a discussion on how adults can be a good influence on young people .
This got me thinking . How do adults influence the behaviour of youngsters ?
And is this always a good influence , or should adults interfere less in the behaviour of younger people ?
This can range from the rules your parents have set for you , to the laws created by the government .
Secondly , adults can offer advice to youngsters .
This might be of great influence on youngsters , because adults are seen as wiser people .
Think of celebrities , for example .
They are a great influence on younger people .
So , when admirable adults set good examples for youngsters , they can influence behaviour in a positive way .
Especially when they have to live under a great number of rules .
This is because adults lived in a completely different time , so their advice might be outdated .
Lastly , when a wrong example is set , this can influence behaviour in a negative way , because they 'll try to copy this wrong example .
Today we will put a spotlight on the famous facts and myths about " Frozen shoulder " .
1- Most patients believe they have got frozen shoulder due to a trauma or injury in the shoulder joint , but this is a myth , because frozen shoulder can occur after a trauma or even without any trauma , as in elderly people , especially those who have diabetes and those recovering from an operation .
2- If you believe that doing exercises worsens your condition , then that is another myth , because frozen shoulder occurs in people who stop or decrease using their shoulder joint for a long time .
Usually , after major operations , having a stroke or bone fracture .
They ignore using the full range of joint motion to avoid the pain sensation .
So an inflammatory response starts leading to the joint stiffness , movement becomes painful and range of movement is limited over time .
3- An important fact about frozen shoulder is that no surgery is usually needed .
The first treatment that your doctor will suggest is medication such as analgesics and paracetamol .
In addition to this , physical therapy is also an important method of treatment to maintain a full range of movement .
Cortisone injections are also helpful . These injections can improve everything ; decrease swelling , stiffness and pain .
You can never have a frozen shoulder if you follow this advice :
- If you have had a surgery or an injury , you should keep moving your shoulder joint within a limit even if it is painful .
- Physiotherapy is not only about exercises ; some physiotherapy techniques can decrease your pain and suffering .
The aim of this report is to inform an international organisation about how our town takes care of the environment as well as about what people do with their rubbish and how the town is trying to keep the area clean and attractive .
Nowadays , young children are well informed about the dynamics and the complexity of the pollution cycle .
Despite the fact that adults were not as well taught as children in school , they are the most civilized and responsible .
A study shows that adults take care of their personal garbage not just because of their education , but because of their eagerness to show their kids that they are great and responsible parents .
Every year , we nominate a person that is responsible for supervising the dustman 's work every single day .
As far as I am concerned , there are now a few rules in our town legislation that if you do not take care of your garbage or if you throw litter on the floor , you will have to pay a fine .
However , everything starts at the level of the education that every human being receives .
Unfortunately , there is still a long way to go in terms of environmental concerns , but some of these solutions suggested by the mayor help us stop the pollution .
There are some kinds of pollution , such as garbage and discarded bottles , but some pollution is invisible , such as noise and dirty air .
It has already had a great impact on people 's lives .
However , air pollution affects not only people 's health but also the whole environmental system .
China is a big industrial country , so there are a great number of factories and trucks .
CO2 can destroy the ozone layer .
If we do n't start to confront this problem , we will hurt this planet we live on .
Environmental problems affect us all .
Not only should the government make laws to control the situation , but also we should do our best not to create more pollution .
For example , if you do n't smoke , you wo n't cause air pollution and you wo n't damage your health .If you use public transportation , walk more or take a bicycle as your transportation , you will not only help reduce the pollution , but also improve your health .
Also , planting more trees instead of cutting them down will purify our breathing air and reduce air pollution .
While there are many things to appreciate and celebrate about the world in which we live , many pressing environmental problems cry out for our attention .
To maintain the only earth we live on is now the major issue for us nowadays .
It was 31st October .
It was dark outside , the weather was windy and the leaves were falling from the trees .
When Alison arrived , she did not see any people .
When it was already 10 pm , suddenly a car appeared in the dark .
Finally , she saw the lights of an approaching car and ran toward the car .
Therefore , it would be incredibly expensive to reunite all of them again for another film .
At that moment , he seemed like the new Steven Spielberg .
Nowadays , he has turned into another director .
It has a couple of good tunes and they use them .
The script is pure gold .
It is so tightly woven you do not realise it is telling you the story of a failure .
Dear Professor Findlay ,
I am excited about applying for the Course Materials Writer position available at your company .
I have an MSc in Food Science and a PhD in Biochemistry .
My scientific work has been published in seven scientific articles .
Moreover , in a position as a Medical Writer , I wrote scientific documents for clients in the pharmaceutical industry .
Furthermore , I was a writer and editor for the project Food Info , a platform to inform the general public about food - science - related topics .
The advertised position is very appealing to me because I have always been fascinated by nutrition and natural therapies .
I would be very motivated to contribute to the development of excellent educational materials for the Faculty of Health and Wellness of Think Education .
I am a very dynamic , creative and proactive person and I have a strong work ethic .
Modern times have raised concern about the environment , climate change and energy .
Public transportation can help fight greenhouse gas emissions and can help us protect the world from climate - change effects .
In recent years , there has been a great change in consumption habits .
Nowadays , people can choose the most convenient way of travelling and there is no doubt that using a private car is easy , cheap and fun .
In developing countries , there is still a low level of awareness about the side effects of using polluting private cars .
But in modern countries , the environmental effects of one 's behavior are becoming important and concerning .
In my opinion , it is just a matter of time until all the transportation options will be public and private cars will be left behind .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
We can know this just by comparing life now and 50 years ago .
Although now we have very advanced technology which has made our lives completely different and more comfortable than before , in the future it will be much better than this .
We will definitely have better drugs and also fewer incurable diseases .
However , it is possible that along with new inventions and research there might be more harmful viruses also .
There are some downsides to an advanced world too . For example , people will be more unhealthy due to the environmental conditions and also less self - reliant because of technological progress .
Many parents face a dilemma when choosing the type of education they wish to give their children and one of the first decisions they must take is what type of school they would like their children to attend and whether it should be a single - sex school or a mixed - sex one .
It can not escape our minds that , at this stage and age , children are exposed to sexual images from a very early age and some people would argue that our society is hyper - sexualised , which is a reason why many parents see single - sex schools as a means to protect their offspring from having sexual thoughts before they are ready to understand the complexity of sex and sexual relationships .
While the hyper - sexualisation of our society may be a reality that many parents would want to protect their children from , it is true to say that children need to adapt and be ready for the society in which they live and for many parents , sending their children to a mixed - sex school is just a natural environment , much more similar to the " outside world " in which they will grow to adulthood .
Considering how much time children spend at school , it seems to me that choosing a single - sex school will make the child , somehow , segregated and , in many cases , reinforce some of the many stereotypes that we , as a society , have regarding gender . Therefore , if we take into consideration that these children are going to be the future leaders , educators , lawyers , politicians and so on , I would argue that the more schools reflect our society and the way that we like it to be , the better , not only for the child as a person , but for the child as a key to the future of the country and , to an extent , to the world .
Therefore , and to sum up , It is my view , that public money is better spent supporting mixed - sex schools , which reflect the society we live in , as opposed to single - sex schools , which may reinforce those stereotypes that are undermining society .
I absolutely agree with this statement . Travelling by car is not only much more convenient than public transport , it also grants one independence to go wherever and whenever one might wish .
The car industry could also be considered one of the main driving forces of the Western economy .
It is true that cars pollute the atmosphere , but it is also true that the emissions from public transport also contribute to pollution - some would say even more than private transport , as Diesel motors are much dirtier and more inefficient than smaller , petrol driven motors like those of private cars .
All things considered , we might conclude that public transport will eventually disappear and , in no time , everyone will be driving their own clean - energy - driven flying cars to go everywhere .
Currently , I am working as a teacher of English in my city of Dnipropetrovsk .
Nowadays , it is important to be a role model for your pupils - so I try to keep fit and show modern movies about staying healthy .
I consider myself to be ideally suited to this job for several reasons .
First of all , I have considerable experience of working with teenagers ( for more than 5 years ) , which I find really enjoyable .
Second , I am a quite energetic , open , active and educated person .
And finally , I am the kind of person who is responsible , well - organised and optimistic .
And , of course , to add an extra activity to my CV as I usually do every summer .
I look forward to your reply .
However , others claim that it is vital for society and future generations .
According to its supporters , there are many benefits of genetic engineering .
As is known , it is used to produce crops that are more resistant to insects and diseases .
Supporters also claim that it is vital for some countries which are struggling with famine .
The other benefit relates to human life .
Genes could be changed before a baby is born . Thus , inherited illnesses would no longer exist .
In spite of the benefits , there are also certain drawbacks to human genetic engineering .
Another problem is genetically modified food products .
In conclusion , it seems the benefits of human genetic engineering outweigh the drawbacks .
Not only did they share a clear interest in writing about social issues that affected contemporary life in Britain , but they also had similar ways of structuring their novels .
In both novels , the writers also dealt with the mistreatment of children in workhouses ( " David Copperfield " ) and Boarding Schools ( " Jane Eyre " ) .
In Dickens ' novels , Realism allows the readers to know how tough London society was in that period .
It was a narrow street lined by two - storey buildings on the ground floor of which shops and pubs were flashing their neon signs .
What he did n't know , or just could n't accept , was he was unwilling to tolerate other people 's views and jokes . That 's why he packed my things and asked me to find another place to stay .
The reason ? I told him I had found a job in another city and I was considering moving house .
I explained to him it was the chance of my life given that good jobs for women are difficult to find , pay is n't the same as for men , and I felt I did n't receive the status men in my company enjoyed .
I mean it was a joke I made , and I had no real intention of leaving him .
I must have seemed cruel to him because , despite our daily disagreements , he adored me and was serious about settling down soon .
As you know , I helped at a U2 concert last month and I 'd like to tell you something more about it .
It was , of course , a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity , one I grabbed with both hands .
When you hear you are asked to help out at a concert by your favourite band , you ca n't refuse .
I must say that not all of them are very easy to work with .
The things some of them wanted : unbelievable ! Luckily , I had some other students helping me find all the curious things for the famous .
Despite all the hard work I had to do , I would not have to think twice if they asked me to do it again .
Not to mention that now I have some good connections in the world of the rich and famous !
Due to the ever - increasing population coupled with climate change , food shortages have become a significant problem facing many countries .
Some assert that genetically modified food technology could be applied to address this problem .
This essay will argue that genetically modified food could be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increased food yield .
It is well known that GM food is inserted with various resistance genes , such as pest disease resistance genes .
This means that the food , being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases , we can minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment .
This reduction in the application of chemical products can create a safer agricultural environment , ensuring food safety .
Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology , such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance , GM food can ensure food production in a period of drought .
Actually , thousands of tests on GM food , before bringing it onto the markets , have proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health .
In conclusion , it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with a reduced use of chemicals .
In view of this , it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortages .
However , because there are some disadvantages to the GM technology which is being developed , it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food .
When a student came in , he was also surprised to see so many people inside , but , after a while , he realized what was really happening : dozens of wet raincoats had been left on the chairs by students of another course .
The student did n't have the courage to interrupt his teacher and give him such a strong pain and disillusion him : he slunk away while the old professor was still speaking enthusiastically to nobody .
Students ' Use of Leisure Time
On 3rd March 2014 , a survey was conducted among 60 students .
The purpose of the survey was to discover the popular leisure time activities of male and female students .
It has been found in the first section that a large percentage of the male respondents preferred to stay at home on holidays , while 90% of the female students like to go to the seaside .
In the second section , both the girls and the boys questioned claimed that they do n't spend their free time going to the theatre or the opera .
For example , only 10% of the boys never do that and 24% go to nightspots at least once a week .
More than half of the male students spend their spare time doing sport two or more times a week .
Unlike the boys , the female respondents usually do n't feel like going in for sport in their leisure time .
In contrast to the male respondents , the girls questioned go to evening classes in their free time .
Like the male respondents , the girls questioned go to the cinema regularly .
For instance , 47% of the female respondents watch films on the big screen every week .
In the third part of the questionnaire , it was found that the male respondents are similar to the girl respondents in that they both enjoy listening to music at home for more than 2 hours a day .
In contrast to the girls questioned , who almost never play computer games , the majority of the male students play games for hours in their leisure time .
The female respondents are more fond of reading books than the male ones .
40% of the girls read books for several hours a day , while 13% of the male students do n't read in their free time at all .
The males who filled in the questionnaire and the females alike spend many hours surfing the Internet .
For example , 53% of the female students are online for more than 3 hours a day .
If any conclusions can be drawn from the data , they are as follows .
There is an obvious tendency towards a decline in active ways of spending free time .
The young people of both sexes prefer to be online or playing computer games in their leisure time .
According to the findings , it is clear that , nowadays , going to nightclubs and cinemas are more popular than going to theatres and operas or visiting historical places .
There is , therefore , a clear need for young people to prefer active and educational leisure time activities to passive ones .
Please accept our sincere apologies ; it was the least of our intentions to offend you with our release letter , which is a standard format authorized by our legal department .
Of course , you can share your opinions and experiences about your stay wherever and with whoever you wish .
There has never been any intention of hiding the truth , as you said .
In addition , we are sorry that your holiday experience was affected by the fire that occurred on Saturday October 10th , 2015 .
It was not an easy task to find new accommodation and relocate over a thousand people .
We do know that the incident might have caused some inconveniences , but the most important thing is that none of our guests or staff were injured .
We are sorry for the time it took to relocate you . The least we could do was to offer you an upgraded room at Paraiso Mar y Beach .
We hope that our explanations and apologies will make you change your mind and that you will give us another chance in the future to provide you with a much more delightful experience .
Given the circumstances , we would like to offer one of the following compensations if you decide to travel with us again in the future :
In my opinion , many people depend on public transport to get to their place of work , university or school .
If you compare the price of petrol with the price of a bus ticket , you can clearly see how much better it is to travel by bus .
I enjoy travelling by bus or train . On your journey you can read or just look through the windows .
However , I must agree that travelling by car can give you more freedom , you can carry your shopping and pick up other people on the way .
Furthermore , you can choose what time you would like to travel and where to .
But despite all this , there will always be people without a car who need to commute every day , so there is a long future for public transport .
As long as people keep accepting this technology for communication , social media sites will also keep proceeding to the next step and affecting society .
In terms of the communication society , they will possibly change the way in which people develop relationships with each other , and consequently , they will create two types of culture : communal and agentic .
In the former , people have almost equal ability , and value interpersonal relationships .
These types of culture will exist in opposition in the future as an effect of social media sites .
There is nothing worse than not being able to communicate with people when you 're in a foreign country .
It might be such a frustrating sensation that you might not want to go back again .
This article deals with the benefits and drawbacks , if there are any , of learning another language .
On the one hand , you 'll feel more active and you 'll realise how your memory gets better and better .
Besides , you 'll understand the native people when you go on holiday .
This could be a drawback because not all people are up to the task .
To wrap up the article , I 'd strongly recommend that young people learn at least one new foreign language , especially if you 're a student .
Nowadays , famous people , like movie stars , politicians , models and other celebrities suffer from a lack of privacy .
They are also the reason for many problems which arise in the private lives of some celebrities .
It is known , that it is the job of paparazzi to follow famous people and look for sensation in their daily behaviour , and celebrities are aware of the fact that they are recognised everywhere , but an interest in someone 's private life , when the person does n't want it is basically a synonym for trespassing .
I strongly agree with the statement , that famous people also should have their own private lives , which no one 's following and that no one knows about .
It is very hard to lead a normal life when you have to think all day long , about what you say , what you wear and , above all , what you do .
Being a celebrity means working all the time . You have not a single moment to relax and forget about your work .
On the other hand , it is obvious that people want to know everything they can about celebrities they like or admire and journalists give them the opportunity to find out some information about their lives , but they often cross the line and literally deprive these famous people of a private life .
In my opinion , everyone deserves to have a private life even if he is a public person .
I 'm sure that no one would like to see their photo in a newspaper , in which they 're eating or making a stupid face and that 's why we should respect others ' privacy .
Everything that goes on in a famous person 's life , including births , deaths , illness and divorces is fodder for the tabloids .
If the individual stumbles , whether figuratively or literally , speculation about him will end up on TV , on the Internet or on the front page of the tabloids .
They think that , due to scandals , they will be able to get fame , live in the lap of luxury and have a lot of money .
On the other hand , not everybody wants to reveal the secrets of their private life .
For these kinds of people , it is important not to bring out family scenes and problems , as they do n't want to be discussed in public .
When you clock off at work , no one has the right to make you keep working .
As it seems to me , private information about stars should be published if they approve of it by putting their signature to it .
It would be fair for celebrities .
I 'm glad to hear that you 've decided to take part in the organisation of this month 's concert .
I hope you find it useful , as I did last month .
I 'm writing to tell you about the experience I gained during preparations for the last concert .
As a volunteer I helped make meals for VIP guests .
I know it could be a problem for you since you ca n't cook , but organisers need volunteers in many fields : scenography , sound , VIP - escort .
Nowadays , almost everyone in the world has contact with computers and the great majority of them have used the Internet .
However , Facebook , like many other social networking sites , has its dark side too .
It may lead to inefficiency at school - or the in workplace - or even sleep disorders .
Nowadays , anyone can take a photo from the web and claim it 's theirs .
And also , let 's not forget that going out with friends from time to time wo n't hurt anyone .
The collapse of the Soviet Union has become one of the defining events in the world 's history .
It influenced the further development of post - Soviet countries as well the as geopolitical situation in the whole world .
It has also influenced international relations not just within the post - Soviet area , but also in the entire world , as the period after the collapse of the USSR was marked by a crash of bipolar structure in international relations .
Since for fifty years the world lived under the shadow of the Cold War , fearing a fatal confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union , the dissolution of the USSR had a huge resonance not only in the US mass - media but also in American society .
The American press had widely covered the revolution in the Baltic States and the tension which had been spread across the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall , as well as the fall of communist governments within the whole former Soviet Bloc .
The tensions in the Soviet Union came to their peak in August 1991 . While Gorbachev was on vacation in the Crimea , a group of right wing military and KGB leaders staged a coup in Moscow .
The " New York Times " made a series of publications dedicated to the coup .
The articles headlined " Soviet crisis " broadly described the situation in the capital of Russia .
On August 20 , the " New York Times " published an article which contained the excerpts from the news conference held by Acting President Gennadiy Yanayev and four other members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency .
The American press , summing up the era of Gorbachov , frequently highlighted his attempts to increase the openness of Soviet society .
The buried secrets of past regimes and the foibles of the present one were exposed to public scrutiny by the press " - the New York Times wrote .
The plotters immediately encountered strong opposition from the leadership of the RSFSR leaders under the guidance of President Boris Yeltsin .
Tens of thousands hit the streets in Russia in order to defend democracy .
Decisive actions by Yeltsin were supported by most world governments and international communities .
Boris Yeltsin gained international acclaim when he occupied the Russian White House and faced down the threats of the coup 's leaders .
The coup , due to lack of organization and support from the military forces , failed three days later .
The figure of Boris Yeltsin became the most popular one at that time the in world 's press .
Leading articles in the most read newspapers in the States were dedicated to the first Russian president .
American newspapers wrote that Boris Yeltsin acquired new status through his defiant stand , also mentioning that the people had known little about him .
The article in the New York Post " THE SOVIET CRISIS ; Yeltsin 's Remarks : A ' Reactionary Coup " refers to the night of 18 - 19 August 1991 , when the legally elected President of the country was removed from power .
The author lays the stress on the democratic processes in the country which acquired a broad and irreversible character .
Also , it shows the attitude of the soviet people towards the changes in the country . "
This coup had great resonance among American society ; consequently , the US mass - media were eager to know the feelings of US citizens about the situation in the Soviet Union .
The US citizen deemed the crisis a menace to the liberalisation of society ; they assumed it to be an actual barrier to the expression of the people 's will . "
The press underlined that many Americans dusted off fears left over from the Cold War and were harshly reminded that this was still the nuclear age .
The dissolution of the Communist party also became one of most popular issues in the American mass - media .
The reduction of Gorbachov 's role and the growth of Yeltsin 's were not out of the attention in US media sources .
The Russian President , Boris Yeltsin , proposed a radical restructuring of the Soviet Union that would minimize the role of Mikhail Gorbachev and reduce the USSR to a loose confederation of nine republics . "
The Communist Party , which has had control for 74 years , is rapidly dissolving " , the Chicago Tribune wrote .
The US mass - media followed the reaction to the crisis inside the Communist party closely . One of the articles in the Washington post " Soviet Turmoil Shakes Europe 's Communists " says that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev 's call for dissolution of the Communist Party Central Committee has called into question the survival of its satellite parties in Western Europe .
The dissolution of the Communist party was considered as one of the features of the collapse of the Soviet Union .
In the Washington Post , the editorial remarks that the failure of the Moscow coup finally broke the influence of the Communist Party over the power structures and the world outlook of Soviet people .
The upshot of the matter is that the dissolution of the Soviet Union has caused the formation of new states and the following referendums on their independence .
The official collapse of the Soviet Union occurred in December 1991 .
On the 25th of December 1991 , Gorbachov officially resigned .
The Washington Post wrote : " a spokesman for Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that the Soviet Union will cease to exist by the end of 1991 .
The Soviet époque , which had existed for 74 years , came to its end and this paved the way for the establishment of new independent republics .
" What are young people interested in ? "
As requested , I interviewed a large number of young people , trying to understand their main interests , especially as regards music , TV programmes and clothes .
Many people aged between fourteen and eighteen said that the most listened to music among teenagers is definitely rock music .
Only a few youngsters listen to classical music and love opera .
The people I interviewed are very keen on reality shows like " Big Brother " and similar , but I have to say that many of them are also interested in cooking shows and documentaries .
Finally , regarding clothes , young people declared themselves to prefer casual outfits like jeans , t - shirts etc .
On the whole , I think that young people now have a wide variety of interests .
A world where everybody is able to communicate in the same language - is that pure utopia or might it be a realistic idea ?
What would the possible advantages and disadvantages of a worldwide spoken language be ?
Establishing English as the new worldwide spoken language might be a good example since English is already spoken by more than 300 million native speakers and , therefore , the third most spoken language in the world , according to Ethnologue .
Moreover , English is already a universal language used by many people to communicate or negotiate in the business market .
However , the realisation of English as a world language would certainly need an educational basis for everyone , which might not be easy to accomplish , but it would be possible .
While teaching everyone English , it would also be profitable to teach basic knowledge of mathematics , physics or other relevant topics which might be helpful .
Such a standardised educational system for every single person in the world would therefore not only benefit the communication or existing businesses but also help third - world countries to start companies , trade and industrialise their countries so they can take care of themselves and get out of poverty .
Moreover , the standardised educational system would also need people who teach and instruct others , so the world language will be established everywhere .
In order to accomplish this endowment there would be a need for teachers which would lead to many new job opportunities .
After all , a couple of professions might become extinct . For example , translators , but , therefore , the organisation and execution of this big project would provide a range of other jobs which could make up for the ones lost .
The educational system would also provide a valuable basis for the world of politics , so conflicts might be prevented due to the lost language barrier with its vulnerability and risks of misunderstandings .
In addition , civil wars or catastrophes like the Arab spring might also be avoided since there will be an educational standard which could teach different types of political leadership .
However , this great improvement still has a few weaknesses .
On the one hand , there would be a great loss of cultures and in some cases the implementation of the educational system might be impossible , for instance with the aboriginal people .
Anyway , those tribes would not even need or want an education or a world language because it is their way of life to live in groups together with nature and disturbing these cultural groups would simply be unnecessary .
On the other hand , the suggestion of English as the worldwide spoken language might be up against a lot of criticism , since the United States does not have many supporters everywhere .
Nevertheless , English was just a suggestion and other languages , like Spanish or Chinese , could certainly be used as well .
Is it really possible that the end of public transport is soon to come ?
I hold the opposite view ; my answer is " no " , for sure .
Yes , they are right in saying so and , in fact , many people are second - hand car owners .
But they seem to have forgotten the extra cost incurred for maintenance and repair , and , of course , buying petrol .
The cost of having a car is hence not as cheap as we think if we also take into account those unavoidable extra costs .
Under these circumstances , some people may prefer to take public transport to save money for their " dream house " rather than buy a car .
It is clearly seen that there is still a lot of room for survival for public transport .
Secondly , even if people have cars , they may also take public transport .
As we all know , Hong Kong is famous for the scarcity of land . There are not many parking spaces available , so employees may not be granted an official parking space by their company and , hence , may resort to public transport if they want to avoid the fees for using the parking lot .
Greenhouse gases have already posed a grave threat to humans , e.g. global warming and ozone depletion , which raised people 's environmental awareness .
Hence , contrary to many people 's perceptions , there should be an increasing demand , i.e. a rosy future , for public transport .
For the reasons mentioned above , it is obvious that the doomsday of public transport is definitely not something down the line .
But how about the more distant future ?
Like our ancestors would never have imagined that we could now fly in the sky by plane .
Technological advancement is , after all , always something that drops a bombshell on us , so suddenly that we can never predict how far it could go .
Maybe one day we will need neither cars , nor public transport .
Simply by thinking of a specific location , we could go there in a split second .
There 's not much work you have to do on a normal day , but maybe this will be a special one , because of the match between Celta and Real Madrid that is going to be held half a kilometre away .
Once you close it , it would be great if you could leave the keys at David 's house , which is in the same building .
There are about 14 workers in the shop , divided into 2 groups with a different schedule for each one .
They have similar skills and productivity , but , to be honest , I prefer working with the morning one . I do n't think you 'll have any problem with either group .
If there is any problem with the cash register ( very common , actually ) , you have a phone number under it of a good technician .
The bill will be paid by us .
Write back soon and let me know if you have any concerns .
However , it is one of the most motivating challenges in our lives .
We are in constant adaptation to new events or personal experiences .
For example , a close relationship or a serious illness makes us look at the world around us through different eyes , and they also let us grow into more interesting and nicer human beings .
Even so , change can be perceived as a disturbing issue due to the fact that it provokes a strong feeling of uncertainty .
Furthermore , we sometimes feel scared of facing new experiences and then we can miss a perfect opportunity to improve ourselves .
In short , I consider that change is always the best way to develop our personality and to become better people in any aspect of our lives , because it represents a major challenge .
It is true that sometimes it is hard to accept certain changes , but we can always learn something useful from them .
Are you OK ?
You said that your flight lands at 10.30 am , so it 's better if you go to the train station near the airport .
When you get out of the airport , you have to turn right and walk for ten minutes and then the station is right in front of you . It 's quite simple my friend ! I 've just looked at the timetable and your train arrives at 11.04 am .
It 's about 6 euros .
So , do n't worry and bring t - shirts and shorts !
Nowadays , there 's more to school than sitting quietly at the desk and solving mathematical equations .
Classes are being held much more interactively than in previous years , and also subjects are supposed to prepare pupils for adult life .
In the following essay , I want to discuss the most useful skills which should be taught in school from an early age on .
In order to prevent the younger generation of our society consuming it , we should give them the possibility to attend cooking classes .
Not only is it an advantage for their health if they 're able to create healthy meals , but it also strengthens relationships among classmates , as they might help and support each other while trying new dishes .
However , there 's still a more important area to have a good knowledge of - personal finance .
Teachers can take up the role of the parents and give them knowledge about finances and the right way to handle them .
To conclude , there are a lot of things worth considering teaching in school .
Both of them are skills which help with managing your life later on , finances in particular .
Jake is a freelance journalist .
He usually travels from place to place following the most burning news around the world .
As a freelancer , he has to invest in his ideas , hoping that someone will like his stories and buy them .
Flying to different continents is easy nowadays but still expensive .
A few months ago , he had been spending two weeks in Brussels .
He was following an important European summit on environmental issues .
Access to different public transport services ( such as underground , buses , tram , etc . )
let him always reach his working meeting on time .
He also had the chance to know more about the diverse atmosphere characterizing each and every Brussels suburb .
During winter , Brussels can be quite cold .
However , underground trains and buses are equipped with such powerful heating systems that you forget about the cold .
He was able to reach the South by a connecting flight from Rome .
It was spring , the prefect time to go and visit the South of Italy .
Nevertheless , his stay was not as pleasant as he had expected .
Jake 's main challenge was to get around and reach the places he had planned to visit both for his research and for tourist purposes .
Its inhabitants get around exclusively in their own cars .
Towns are congested with traffic james , especially during rush hours .
Such an experience made Jake realise the considerable impact that a good public transport system has on people 's lives and their surroundings .
Stress - it makes your life easier , since you avoid driving in the middle of traffic jams
Communications - it eases movement from place to place
- access to public transport is way cheaper than taking care of your own car ; though initially it might look like a huge investment of money from the community , in the long term it shows itself to be the most efficient way to travel !
Although , I have been struck by its major attractions , such as Plaza De Espana , Real Alcazar and El Torre del Oro , it is the relaxed and social way of living which has most impressed me .
Therefore , it all comes down in this essay to expressing feelings about Seville and its surroundings .
Consequently , what are the reasons for my change of heart ?
The more I understand it , the more I like it .
Luckily , this has not been the case when it comes to Seville .
What 's more , Seville is bright , colourful and lively , which cheers me up and relaxes me .
To make matters even better , there was some music playing a few metres ahead , which contributed to livening up the spirits of everyone present there .
In addition to this , I really like sharing tapas dishes with people , drinking a good fresh " draft beer " and going for a " tapas crawl " with friends , as in Switzerland each person gets their own dish when eating out and they only go for a " pub crawl " .
I am also keen on wandering off at my own pace and getting lost in the winding narrow cobbled streets , as I feel like an adventurer looking for new treasures .
Some of these are striking secluded places , such as churches or Moorish - styled houses .
Thus , scouring Seville is like rewinding time and being propelled into the past .
It turns out now to be a very welcoming and relaxing place where warm - hearted people live and where I greatly enjoy spending some time .
This year , in Italy , for the first time in more than 200 years , a weird coincidence happened : the political leader , Silvio Berlusconi , and the singer Ligabue marked their careers on the same day .
On the one hand , Berlusconi compromised his position when some journalists told the world about some wiretappings of his which would compromise his future political career ; on the other , Luciano Ligabue won the award for the best song of the year , bringing his career ever forward .
If I also had a year free , I would only want to travel , not work .
If you decide to base yourself in Geneva , I suggest you first visit the north of Switzerland from the west to the east and then the south of Switzerland from the east to the west .
Switzerland is a small country , so take your time and spend enough time in each place .
Concerning your inquiry about working in my country , it 's really difficult to get authorisation to work , especially for periods longer than a week .
Therefore , I suggest you work during your travelling time .
For instance , if you plan to stay more than one week in Zermat in Wallis , think about trying to find a place where you could help in a restaurant or a shop .
But if you prefer to work during a full three - month period , you should ask your employer for a work permit .
She said that she would come out in five minutes .
Five more minutes went by , and he decided to go into the bungalow .
They both knew what would happen if Tris 's husband found a stranger in his house .
- I must find her before he does .
First of all , public transport is obsolete .
Finally , you can choose who will travel with you .
It could seem to point towards public transport , nevertheless it will push car travel even further .
In summary , public transport is dying .
This TV series is mainly based on working - class people and represents various ethnic minority communities , including African and Asian Muslims .
This show is particularly good , as it represents how people from different ethnic backgrounds can engage with each other .
Although this soap involves a lot of cheating and plotting between characters , it also shows the importance of family values . I would definitely recommend this drama series to other people .
It is important to gain awareness about different cultures due to the fact that Britain is becoming such a multicultural society .
Second , people on boats are granted the opportunity to see beautiful ocean wildlife , while taking a plane does n't provide this luxury to take a look at the birds in the sky because planes travel at such a high speed .
I am writing to complain about the suggested ban on smoking in public areas .
I am very concerned about this proposal for a number of reasons .
To support my argument against this proposal , I would like to explain what happened when the authorities attempted to introduce a ban on smoking in my home town .
In the first place , few people knew about this law , and , of course , most businesses opposed the idea .
If this happened in Cafe Noir , I could probably lose my job .
In my opinion , introducing specific non - smoking areas in this type of establishment could be an excellent idea .
It 's not easy for me to talk about myself , but I 'll do my best .
I 've been living in Augsburg for nearly two years now and am studying for a B.A. in Anglistik and economics .
Before moving to Augsburg , I studied biology for two semesters in Erlangen , but soon realised that it was n't the right subject of study for me .
Biology is still a hobby of mine , but I 've always been good at languages and so I 'm doing something I 'm naturally good at now .
I can speak English and , of course , German - and because my grandparents are from Korea , a little Korean , too .
The good thing is : the rest of the time , living with boys is as uncomplicated as it gets .
Also , I have visited the USA many times : I ' ve travelled the west coast from San Diego to San Francisco , I 've been to Las Vegas , Chicago and Boston .
I am a 23-year - old student doing a Sports Science degree , so I am interested in sports .
Besides , I am open - minded , easy - going and friendly .
I have experience of children 's Summer camps and I recently attended a First Aid course , so I could deal with a difficult situation .
In addition , I speak a little French .
I have no problem with being hired for three months because I do not go to university in the summer .
It demands physical effort , being an excellent way to keep fit .
Starting with the social skills , it is obvious that a football match is a dispute , a game we get involved in with the intention of winning .
This kind of action , when performed collectively , requires coordination of efforts and an ability to work together , two qualities that are frequently forgotten in our individualistic world .
If you play football , you know how to act when in a team .
Also , football is a physical game .
Unlike chess or bridge , football makes you jump , run , kick .
In times of escalators and cars , it is refreshing to find an activity that involves movement , velocity and strength .
In fact , it can be argued that the human virtues are a by - product of conflicts and fights ; that they are those character traits that we acknowledge as important for everybody engaged in a competition , be it for a trophy or for a country .
It is a sport that develops not only the body , but also the mind and the heart .
In a club , you will find professional advice and also as many people as are necessary for a match .
In fact , if football has a downside , it is this , the fact that you need twenty - two people to set up a match .
But , provided you have that , you will have one of the best ninety minutes of your entire life .

Having graduated from UCLMD in 2016 as an IT - based marketing communication professional with a focus on Business English , I could be a great asset to your company .
During my studies I doubled the conversion rate of a London - based hotel 's website , and improved the effectiveness of their e - mail campaign by 150% .
I did so by clearly outlining principles which proved to work with their target audience and they can keep using as a guide .
I have been volunteering for various similar projects .
You can find a list of these with my achievements in my CV .
I have been following your marketing activities , and I have a number of new , creative ways on my agenda . I could improve your brand image as part of your team .
To further improve my Chinese , I enrolled for the Post - Intermediate Mandarin class during my undergraduate studies , in which I achieved a First - Class result .
Beyond my academic subjects , I have consistently taken up some active roles at university and outside school to further develop my interpersonal and leadership skills .
I was trained as a PASS ( Peer Assisted Study Session ) leader for econometrics to provide some academic support to some younger students during my final year of study at Manchester .
I attended training sessions and workshops to learn about the skills to be a good facilitator before the start of the academic year .
The regular meetings with my group of students to discuss their questions on econometrics have developed my empathy , which is a crucial skill for being a leader .
In addition , I have undertaken an internship at HSBC Risk in order to gain an insight into the banking industry and learn how to work with my peers in a business environment .
In the following days , we mostly had bread and sandwiches for our meals .
During those 10 days , we walked a lot instead of catching a bus , because it saved money too .
This is a real vacation for me .
Even though I was in a romantic city , I could n't enjoy my vacation in a romantic way due to the low budget we had .
To me , a dream vacation is like going to a beautiful island like Palau , where I could enjoy the sunshine and the sea .
When I was there , I would start my day by calling room service for a wonderful breakfast in bed .
As the day went on , I would also go swimming in the deep blue sea , go snorkeling or just lie on the beach .
This is the kind of dream vacation I want so badly .
There are always differences between a real vacation and a dream vacation .
Once I have enough money , I will make my dream vacations come true .
When I finished high school , I started working as an accountant in my father 's carpentry business .
He produces doors and windows in wood .
At the beginning , it was really difficult for me because I was a little shy with customers and I was n't used to working among noisy machinery and shouting workers , but after a while , I learned to ignore all of that !
My father was happy because it was a great opportunity and understood that it was what I 'd been dreaming of for a long time .
Five years have passed and I 'm still working for this company , which has given me a lot , and I 've been learning many things about accounting .
In fact , I am administrative manager and I feel really proud of myself .
Last but not least , I 'm a great fashion expert because I work near the shopping streets !
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I would like to apply for the job which involves working in summer camps all over the USA .
My name is Aly Meeuws . I am 16 years old . I live in The Netherlands at the moment and I am really planning on going to the USA in the future , so this would definitely be a great experience for me , especially for my English and being away from home .
Until next summer , I will still be in school but , hopefully , I will graduate so I can go to college afterwards .
Often , after school , I babysit my parents ' friends ' children and I usually really like it ! I am also a very athletic person , so I would not mind entertaining the children for a longer period of time and also doing some physical exercises .
Besides that , I also really enjoy cooking with my mom at home , so working in the kitchens would not be a problem at all .
Once , I cooked a Christmas dinner for me and my whole family and , surprisingly , everyone enjoyed it , which definitely came as a surprise to me !
There has never been a bigger force for change than technology . It changes absolutely everything about the way we live , even the way we talk with each other .
Social Media such as Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and blogs illustrate clearly that the definition or influence of digital technologies is created through the forms in which they are used and the social relations and associations that expand around them .
This essay will discuss the implications of social media for everyday life , emphasizing the problems which have arisen from the use of Facebook and Twitter .
Finally , it will look into possible future implications of this kind of technology .
Social networking websites can be explained as a web utility that allows people to create a public or semi - public profile , arrange a list of other contacts with whom it is possible to share connections and look at and cross their list of connections and those made by others within the system .
Namen and Kinnison ( 2012 ) indicates that " the three types of social interactions that social networking enables include ( 1 ) creation of an online identity , ( 2 ) establishment of relationships between users , and ( 3 ) development of layered communities defined by the lists of connections each user establishes " .
Another rapidly expanding social networking tool is Twitter .
These kinds of websites allow people to interact with others directly via smartphones or computers .
Through Twitter , users post opinions or comments restricted to 140 characters .
On the other hand , on Facebook , people can share pictures , videos and thoughts without restrictions .
As a result of an appropriate use of social networking tools in education , Javanovic , Chiong and Weise ( 2012 ) demonstrate that students adopt Facebook not only for socialising but also for academic purposes , for example , to obtain benefits for their studies or to save time by discovering learning resources ( p.39 ) .
Furthermore , some departments of police in the USA have used Facebook to share a video of a felony with the expectation of identifying the suspects , and their followers were apt to say something about the incident in response to the publication .
Additionally , a politician from Philadelphia , USA was elected after taking advantage of his Twitter account appropriately during his campaign .
My ex - husband taught me not to get involved with some kinds of people by analyzing his behavior before commitment .
During our courtship he was very charming and attentive .
We discussed some sexist ideas that I do n't agree with about what society demands of people and I noticed a little sexism in him , but I was fine with that because that can happen . But due to my profession , he could n't be like that for so long , because I was in a man 's shoes .
He was very jealous , but I thought it would fade away with time and with the gaining of trust , but it did not and ended up making me sick as the time passed .
I learned that a man does anything to conquer a woman . He even does a lot of hateful things for him , such as going to her home every night to be together or to hang out , while later you find out that he hates going to places except his house .
I learned a man says anything just to shut you up and not discuss things , just to have some love moments .
I also learned that men think in a different way from women during the day .
For example , while women think about millions of things like what they want to do or have to do during the day , men just do not think about anything and can be like that for hours , just with a blank mind .
But , in my opinion , this should be an excuse to think something that women should n't know anything about .
I also learned that it is the mother that gives the principles and the direction of a man 's mind , and depending on her , he is going to be a sexist or not , he is going to help and be an honorable man or not , he is going to be a good and caring father or not , he is going to be a responsible human being or not .
A mother is absolutely fundamental and the basis for the man 's principles and beliefs .
Women do not know their importance for the future in their own homes .
They teach the same things over and over again and do not rethink whether those beliefs and actions are really right to help the world change and be a better world for everyone .
Princess Sophie grew up , she was so unhappy because she could n't do anything , she was condemned to live in a room of the castle until someone could find the cure for her curse .
One day she figured out how to escape through a hidden passage , she got to the town and ran and jumped , she did every little thing she had n't been allowed to do for so long .
While she was having some fun , a handsome boy bumped into her and she fell to the ground .
" I am so sorry Madam , excuse me for my blunder .
I am Michael . "
The princess was a little scared of talking to someone she did n't know , because she had never got to talk to anyone before , but still she answered him with a big smile " You are excused , my name is Sophie . " It truly was love at first sight .
Michael asked her to go with him for an ice cream so he could make up for his mistake .
Sophie accepted and they started a strong friendship that , with time , became more than just a friendship ; they fell in love with each other .
Princess Sophie used to escape so she could meet with Michael , until one day , when she was just about to meet Michael to confess to him all the truth about who she really was , a guard discovered her and the King commanded him to lock her up in her room .
Princess Sophie sent him a lot of letters telling him the truth about herself , and about her curse .
Michael decided to leave the kingdom , when he was just about to close the door , he turned back to his coffee table and saw the letters , he had a hunch but he ignored it .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
What happens in the future will be decided by what happens now .
People are advised to carpool and travel together to work places .
Various announcements over radio and TV emphasize the need to use the public transport system for travelling to save the environment .
People may choose to ignore the advice now but , in the future , they may not have a choice .
One of the latest films I have seen is Silver Linings Playbook , played by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence .
It 's a comedy with romantic features and , at the same time , very realistic .
They meet by chance and start a tortuous relationship as friends .
Interestingly , they find the way to help each other and , not surprisingly , in the end they fall in love .
I personally think that the film shows an interesting view of psychiatric illnesses and the importance of the family in this type of problem .
I strongly recommend you go and see the film .
They enjoy both local bands ' output and some foreign songs .
Apart from classics like Friends , popular shows include How I Met Your Mother , The Big Bang and the new HBO talk show Last Week Tonight . I can say with high certainty that reality TV is no longer in with young people in my country .
Most teens tend to create their own unique style , often managing to start a fashion of their own .
This information could help the organizers of next year 's festival in choosing appropriate music and catering to a variety of tastes .
My friend Peter recently told me that he was moving out of his flat , so I asked him if he was willing to rent it .
Furthermore , you will increase the course fee by 15% from next month .
In the future , you do not provide the Japanese course at a convenient time .
I am very sorry , but I can not accept this !
It 's about the story of a little boy that is haunted by a big secret ; he is visited by ghosts .
The boy soon becomes friends with the psychologist , and he starts noticing plenty of things about this exceptional boy .
I found this movie both exciting and emotional . Both thumbs up for me !
As the secretary of the English Language Club , I am writing to propose that our club be given funding for the coming year .
Outline of the club 's activity
We regularly organise film projections and discussions around a subject related to the film .
For example , with every film seen , our students have the chance to practice their language and to develop their own opinions , particularly as we always have discussions around a subject related to the film .
Also , our monthly speakers are excellent . For example , last year we invited a well - known actress , Janet Hewitt , to share some of her experience on Broadway .
Unfortunately , organising these kinds of events is costly and the money from membership fees is not enough .
We also believe the college benefits from our club .
Being founded in 1920 by our well - known alumnus , John Carter , the English Language Club is the oldest club in our college .
The fact that everyone from the community can participate in our events helps us to develop a positive relationship between the college and the community .
We hope you will be able to take all this into account and will find it possible to help us continue and improve our club by funding us .
Especially when it comes to going shopping .
Shopping centres are located in the city centres , so every road trip lasts ages ( I live in a suburb ) . Thus , when I get to the mall , I am already bent out of shape .
Afterwards , the crowd of people is ramming me when I 'm trying to walk .
The lighting in shops is unpleasant .
I 'm not able to find any nice clothes .
At the end , I 'm livid and exhausted .
The way Easter and , specifically , Good Friday are celebrated is gradually deprived of religious content .
People do n't want to contemplate Christ 's suffering , but they want to move directly to the cheerful part of the Easter celebration , so , to Easter Sunday .
Suffering , as well as death , is pushed away from our real life - we do n't want to experience them , but would rather watch them on different kinds of TV shows .
3 . The L'Oreal slogan " Because you 're worth it " proves the author 's thinking that we are unwilling to sacrifice ourselves .
In a consumer lifestyle , we want more and more for ourselves , but not for other people , because it will require self - sacrifice .
It was a hot summer 's day , everyone was walking to their usual destination ; work , school , to buy some groceries , pick up the laundry or their clothes from the cleaners . Everyone except Peter .
He was sweating , looking at people in a confused way .
Suddenly , Peter started to run . While he ran , he looked at his watch , over and over again , as if by looking at his watch time would stop .
But this was not the case , time continued to pass by , ever so slowly , making Peter even more agitated .
He stopped at a great big building , knowing that the fastest way to get to the top floor of the building was by taking the elevator , but what if the elevator stopped ?
He decided to take the stairs , and so he did .
Peter smiled for a brief moment as he remembered his obsession with Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity . He thought , " finally I understand it " .
It is clear that most of them use computers and watch television almost every day , but while they are doing this , they are sitting on a comfortable sofa .
I feel very strongly that computer games could be an enjoyable way to do physical exercise without leaving home .
On the market , you can find a wide range of computer games or video games to keep fit , such as dancing to the rhythm of the latest hits , playing tennis , doing aerobics , running ...
It is true that many young people do extra activities related to sports , like football or basketball .
Although some schools offer the chance of doing these , many others do not .
To sum up , it is important to motivate young people to do physical exercise .
It seems to me that school programmes would make young people be encouraged to keep fit because , in this way , they do their favourite sport in a routine way .
It all started with jumping over big black trashcans .
Back in the time , when I successfully passed third grade , my parents decided to let me pick the present that I wanted as a reward .
The very first thing that came to my mind was a pair of inline roller skates ; I used to look out of my window , or sit on my house 's doorstep and see my neighbors skating and trying to do some tricks and jumps , and all I wanted was to join them instead of watching them enjoying themselves .
I ran to the outdoor toys section and I picked the skates I liked .
I tried a couple of sizes to see which one fitted best .
I could not have been more excited about joining my friends .
With time , I got better , and I started to learn how to do tricks and jump over small items .
While skating was a whim for my friends and me in the beginning , I found myself through it .
I knew that skating was the thing I wanted to do for the rest of my life , the thing I wanted to tell people about when they asked me what my favorite thing to do was .
In a couple of years , I became much better and I learned to do many tricks , like skating backwards , the Snake and the Zigzag .
I learned how to jump over many things , such as chairs and the trashcans that my neighbors used to jump over .
I kept trying to find out more about skating .
I went to middle school ; I met two friends who also loved to skate ; Mohammed and Khalid .
We decided to go skating on the next weekend at the park , which has a wide path by the sea .
When we met on the weekend , I noticed that they were different ; they had different skates , and different methods of skating , they slid on edges and skated on the park benches .
I realized that this is what I was looking for ; a new additional excitement to add to skating .
I had to wait for two months to buy a new pair of skates , but this time it was aggressive skates .
Once , on a weekend , it was my last year in middle school , I was at the park practicing as usual .
I introduced myself , and as I thought , they were visiting from a different city .
The more we got deep into conversation , the more I wanted to learn this type of skating .
They showed me what slalom skating was .
They started to put small cones in a line with a bit of space in between .
They played some music and started to skate with the rhythm . I was surprised , I had mixed feelings , and it was indescribable .
I kept staring at them with a wide open mouth and eyes .
I knew at that moment that I wanted to change my style of skating .
And , as the skaters suggested , I bought a pair of hockey skates .
I did not have the ability to order the cones online back then , so , I went to IKEA , and bought small colored cups and used them as cones .
After a couple of hours of trying to get used to my new skates , I put the cups on .
After almost 3 years of practicing to do tricks , to create a perfect match between my moves and the rhythm of the song I am playing , and to try to reach perfection , I realized that slalom skating is more like a performing art than a sport .
Unlike in my country , Philadelphia is always rainy , wet , and sloppy .
This weather was an obstacle . It was impossible to skate in these conditions .
However , I was not going to give up on skating that easily .
A friend suggested giving ice skating a shot , and for me , everything is worth trying just to be able to skate again .
What I learned in 10 years , I had the ability to learn on ice in one month .
Today , After 10 years of skating , I wonder sometimes what my life would be without skating . I believe that skating is a huge part of me , Mohammed , and I am positive that if this part was missing , my path in life would have changed and I would never be the same person I am now .
Singapore could be the place where you will find everything you are looking for .
This place is a hub where east and west meet , it is one of the biggest and busiest ports in the world .
If you are looking for any luxury brands and an extravagant shopping experience , this is the right place .
Vivo city in Harbourfront and shopping street on Orchard Road are good if you want to buy anything from mid - range to high - end goods .
Both places are extremely crowded with people on the weekend , so unless you enjoy people watching , early - bird shopping is highly recommended .
Haji Lane in Bugis has lots of local boutiques where you can find unique pieces by designers from Asia .
Graffiti on the walls and small alleyways create a punky ambience .
Lastly , there are sports dedicated malls , which are Velocity in Novena , Kallang mall and Queensway mall .
I 'm usually not good at talking or any social things .
I love to listen to him talking - I love his voice .
I ca n't bear even a second of our awkward silences .
I 'm the kind of person who used to think that every hour had a purpose , who had no time to waste , not even a single hour .
I always had things to do .
He is the most important thing to me .
Advertising is most commonly aimed at the manipulation of consumers ' behavior in a commercial aspect .
But at the same time , advertising has many features in common with art .
Like art , it is intended to evoke emotions and feelings .
To be successful , advertising often uses images from popular movies , catchy melodies , unusual graphic elements and fragments of famous paintings .
Often , people who are watching a commercial , do not remember what details or elements of other visual art types they have seen before .
Secondly , art , like advertising , is such a large part of our everyday lives .
Someone designed all the things around us : a chair , shoes , clothes .
Visual advertising like painting , uses color , value , space and line .
These are elements of art .
Also , it uses balance , contrast , emphasis and proportion .
These are principles of design .
Lastly , advertising , like art , originated a long time ago .
With the development of mass media , television and internet advertising has become the strongest form of communication .
Now , advertising is a big part of modern culture .
Advertising shares similarities with art and often combines other types of art to be more successful .
Modern technologies and the development of mass media , have allowed advertising to become the greatest art of the 20th century .
Michael got out of bed on the wrong side that day or , at least , that 's what he thought when , on his way to work , he was so concentrated on looking down at his mobile phone that he did n't see a woman approaching him and they both collided .
In her left hand there was a large steaming cup of coffee that landed on Michael 's new shirt when he bumped into her .
One second later , Michael was covered in coffee , burnt and sticky and his mobile phone screen was winking until it finally turned off with a dying flash .
He screamed , shouted , waved his hands in the air , swore and insulted that stranger until his rage faded away .
In this article a teacher reflects on his experiences of creating plays and using them to help motivate students to develop their English .
It consists of eight parts : Introduction ; How to start ; Writing the play ; I want to be Cinderella ; Practise ; The big night ; Reason for putting on a play and A few final thoughts .
The author says that the pros far outweigh the cons and that is the main idea of the article .
Writing the play : first , you can ask learners to invent profiles and to tell you about their characters ; second , learners can write the basic outline of the play or you can adapt a familiar story .
Then you should take a decision about choosing roles : start by asking for volunteers , and always ensure that everyone in the class has a role or something to do .
The most effective way is to practise every lesson for ten minutes at the beginning and end .
Some learners will not want a speaking part . You could even ask them to be promoters .
Reasons for putting on a play : learners will learn whole chunks of language in a clear context and they will learn not only their parts .
It gives learners the opportunity to demonstrate their different skills in the language classroom .
Also , they can see how much language they can produce .
In a world of increasing environmental awareness , improved public transport represents the way of the future .
Although people do enjoy the convenience and privacy of travelling in their own private vehicles , in my opinion , they might choose public transport if it fulfilled certain conditions .
For example , if people know that by using buses and subway , they can save enough money to take a free holiday each year , many more individuals would be persuaded to travel in this way .
Regarding my academic experience , I am currently completing my degree in Primary Teaching and Psychology at the University of Valencia , Spain , where my current speciality is misbehavioral children .
So far , I have received excellent grades in all subjects , and I am on course to graduate with distinction at the end of the semester .
Enclosed you will find photocopies of all relevant certificates .
I believe my greatest strengths lie in my ability to work well and an aptitude for taking on whatever challenges come my way .
My future career in teaching would be greatly enhanced by earning a degree at your university .
Furthermore , it is better for the planet to ride a bike instead of driving a car because cycling does n't produce any pollution .
When you start riding a bicycle , you first need to check if your bike complies with the safety regulations .
You also need to know some basic rules such as putting out your arm to indicate when you turn and , of course , you need to know the highway code .
Indeed , some places still need to improve the structures for bikes : sometimes they do n't have a lot of cycle paths .
But if you learn how to obtrude in the traffic while remaining polite with others , there is no reason to be afraid .
How are things ? I got your message last week .
First of all , I met a lot of people from all over the world . I keep in touch with them all the time .
During the concert , I was responsible for checking tickets .
I was working with two people and we had to check two thousand tickets !
We were cleaning for over 8 hours !
It was fantastic to take part in that enterprise .
She swiftly came to my bed and gave me a letter .
It was from the most dangerous and terrifying gang in the village .
I met those boys the next Friday and they told me that I had to pass the initiation test .
I went into the tiny shop and the shopkeeper looked through me .
The shopkeeper nodded and pointed at a grey fridge at the end of the shop .
" Thank you " , I mumbled , and went straight to the fridge .
My hands were sweating and the other boys were waiting outside , ecstatic .
A second later , a child entered the shop and began to move around quickly .
I thought it was the perfect moment and , at the speed of light , I put a whole box of sweets into my old bag .
I walked forwards and stared at the shopkeeper .
I was going to leave , when the bitter and loud voice of the man surprised me .
" I do n't know " , he answered , confused .
" Dear me ! How can you be so cheeky ? " he uttered dismissively , tapping his feet .
The boy began to cry .
After watching this , I returned to my house hoping the man would forgive the child .
That was the first crime I committed and here I am now , in jail .
This text leads us into the ( for me unknown ) world of horse racing .
In a few sentences , we can get an idea of what it is .
And we can find different reasons to be interested in this type of event .
If you like animals , you 'll enjoy seeing those beautiful horses running and jumping as fast as they can .
If you like to bet and you 're not used to doing it at horse races , maybe you 're looking forward to trying to bet on the nose or each way ?
And if you love fashion and you have the chance to go to Ascot , you may run into the Queen and greet her , and at the same time enjoy the fabulous sight of all those extravagant hats the ladies wear .
Meanwhile , you can have a good time drinking some bubbly .
And of course , if you 're not an it - girl , you can spend a lot of money and choose the wrong dress to attend Ascot and perhaps you 'll have to watch the races from behind a curtain .
Anyway , if you knew beforehand your odds of winning , it would n't be so thrilling .
And if you want to admire the wonderful world of hats , you 'd better buy some magazine where you 'll find all the photos for just 2 € .
thanks for the letter which has just arrived . I 've read that you 're writing a term paper on the chances of developing countries to profit from the electronic revolution , are n't you ?
Because two days ago I read an article by Nadine Bös about this topic .
The article was about the possibility to transfer money with mobile phones in developing countries .
First , you should know that the technical term for this is " mobile banking " .
Today it is a fact that there is a target group for mobile banking : people who are living in remote areas of the world .
On the one hand , there are hardly any banks in these regions , so they do n't have access to bank services .
But on the other hand , the number of mobile phones has risen .
So now the most important factor is that mobile networks are reaching the remotest areas in the world .
Through this , many people would have access to mobile banking and , in addition to that , it makes money available so it can be used in shops .
According to Hannah Dideck the largest potential is that migrants can use mobile banking to send money home .
I hope I have helped you with this information .
This aspect has also enabled employees to become homeworkers as they no longer need to be present in an office to get a job done .
Furthermore , mobile phones allow last - minute - changes very easily .
However , the biggest strength of the mobile phone is also the biggest risk , in my opinion : being connected all the time creates a lot of stress for people , as you are always available for everyone .
Therefore , you do n't have any time to relax , which is essential , even from your leisure commitments .
The same is valid for business life : if employees are available all the time , they take the worries of the daily business with them to their home , which means a lot of stress .
However , I personally think that it should not be regarded too critically but should only be handled responsibly , according to one 's personal needs .
Before the trip started , the company who decided to make this trip said that everything was perfectly calculated so that it was impossible to have any kind of problem with the spacecraft .
The first 30 years all was going well , but suddenly something bad happened .
One of the cabins broke down and the person who was inside it woke up .
This guy was called Mark and he was an engineer .
Once he realized that he was the only person awake he knew something was wrong .
The first 2 years , all was perfect until day number 734 .
After that , they never spoke again .
It was such a hot summer that it was impossible to turn off the ventilator and I was a bored child with a laptop . I had signed in on the social network , Tuenti , and I liked passing all the time chatting .
She picked me up and took me to her house .
Louis was convinced that this new project would be an incredible opportunity for him to try new things and study different fields , which he enjoyed . He loved to read about science , inventions , and keep up - to - date with the news .
But he immediately thought - why not continue doing what I love while I do something new ?
That 's exactly what he began to do .
He sent an e - mail to the tour company explaining his situation and sudden interest in this project .
The company immediately replied telling him that they were sorry that they did n't reply days earlier , but they could n't , since the system crashed and did n't allow them to send electronic mail , just to receive it .
They said that it was alright if he was interested in other projects , but he still needed to give the same working performance .
They asked him about this project and what his idea was .
He did trust the company , but not enough for them to know everything he thought .
The company told Louis that they did n't want to bother him , but that they were interested in investing in this kind of project , because it was related to the purpose of the company : exploring .
But Louis knew that the invention needed to have a great design that implemented portability , that is why he needed to refine his ideas for this project to be used in a large number of useful ways .
The company told Louis that they wanted to invest in this project and help Louis .
Later that same day , Louis went cave diving in the mainland .
He wanted to conquer as much territory down the sea level as he could .
He loved the idea of descending to the bottom of the sea where his ideas would n't be taken away or heard .
While he was exploring the bottom of the sea , he tried to grab a rock , but just when he touched it , it scattered into dust , which vanished in the bulk quantity of water around him . That was when he knew the next important thing that the invention needed to have : resistance .
Although it also needed to be flexible , it needed to be tough .
If not , the consumers of this product would end up buried .
What happens to the rubbish ?
Although citizens usually obey those rules , in some cases , they are completely neglected .
However , people who have bigger houses tend to compost the organic waste and that makes up for the disobedience .
The situation with household litter looks much better than what happens on the streets of the city .
Authorities make sure that rubbish bins are placed at short distances apart since this is the most common reason why people throw litter on the ground .
Not only does it give people a job , but it also has a good impact on the town 's appearance .
Although there are many people who suggest that public transport is no longer a suitable option because cars are considered a more convenient option for transport , there are more benefits using public transport than travelling by car , such as reduction of traffic , saving money , and decreasing pollution .
Firstly , a car can carry only 5 people at a time .
A bus or an underground train can carry from 30 to 100 people at a time .
The less we use cars , the less traffic we will see in the roads .
Secondly , having a car means different costs have to be afforded .
If a person constantly uses his / her car , he / she will need to pay for more petrol .
Equally importantly , a car requires maintenance and it will be another expense that the owner has to cover .
Finally , if every person drives his / her own car , pollution will considerably increase , affecting air conditions .
I had to stand because we were moving house and had just sold almost all of our furniture on OLX .
My mother said that it would be rude to go out at that time .
When I opened my eyes , I saw a beautiful chair with orange and green stripes .
Suddenly , the chair jerked up and went straight out of the window while I was still sitting on it .
It swerved , beautifully avoiding a tree , and landed on the ground as softly as a butterfly .
Taking a year off might help people who are uncertain about what to do next to make up their minds while trying new things and having new experiences that will be useful later in their lives .
It would certainly be counterproductive and a waste of time if the time is spent doing nothing and just passing the time as if it were a long vacation , but if it is used to have new experiences , a year off can change the future of a person .
It can be a great opportunity to travel , meet new cultures and people , or it can be a chance to work to save up money to be able to afford the cost of the university a person planned on attending .
Or maybe , during the year off , somebody could also decide that they do n't want to continue their studies , because they have already found what they want to do or be .
Sales promotion , which is the set of marketing activities undertaken to boost sales of a product or service , has become a vital tool for marketing and its importance has been increasing significantly over the years .
In spite of some controversies , sales promotion has already demonstrated a massive positive impact on both sellers and buyers .
The aim of this presentation will be to analyse the aims and approaches of sales promotion as well as to evaluate both the benefits and the drawbacks sales promotions provide .
Then the presentation will focus on a specific case study------the utilization of Flybuys loyalty reward program .
I am writing in order to apply for the position of volunteer in a summer camp in the USA as written in the advertisement .
I am currently taking exams for my English degree at the Ukraine National University .
Also , I am able to work with children as I used to be a tutor in a sports summer camp .
I 'm studying a degree in Biotechnology at IQS , here in Barcelona .
In my free time I like to meet with my friends , go skiing , listen to some music and watch films and series .
This summer I would like to come to one of your camps in the USA .
I 'm a very extroverted guy , with experience taking care of children , as I 've been working as a skiing trainer for 2 years now . This winter will be the third .
I 'm also very self - confident and independent , as I live alone , which has made me a very good cook .
All of these abilities make me think I 'm the perfect man for your job .
With any new course , there are certain expectations one will have .
At the beginning of this course , as a first year postgraduate student , I was ambitious to create a new mechanical product or at least part of it at the end of this course by applying knowledge and skills that are provided throughout the course .
Before taking part in this course , my concept of mechanical design was about applying either self knowledge or working as a part of a team to design mechanical products that are easy to manufacture , durable and financially reliable .
My thoughts about mechanical design matched somewhat with the information that was provided in the first three weeks .
By attending the first three lectures , I soon realized that my general concept of mechanical design is quite simple as my thoughts about mechanical design are purely just creating new products .
It can be seen in many aspects , ranging from producing a maintenance process , improving performance for a specific part of the mechanical system , to creating the whole new product .
This is because , despite having experience in industrial design , I never took part in the design process from the initial stage .
Therefore , my knowledge of mechanical design is rather limited .
Being placed in a project team working for Sydney Water on producing a maintenance excellent standard , I started to read the course outline and lecture notes more carefully to find out where to start and what I should do to deliver a good outcome .
The first thing I noticed was the importance of clarifying all the requirements with the clients .
This was demonstrated during the project Introductions session as well as the lecture notes , client interview task and client feedback ( which is worth 25 points in the total mark ) .
As soon as I met my group , I discovered how far behind I am in terms of using English to demonstrate the ideas and attract the attention of other group members .
However , this is also an opportunity to meet up and work every week with people for whom English is their first language , to improve my oral communication skills and persuasion .
The final consideration is the self - calibration , which also is a point that I have never considered before in a design process .
To sum up , at the end of week three , my expectations for this course are to be able to apply my reflective thinking in any further design process , to be able to deliver a persuasive technical presentation , and to be effective in verbal communication skills and presentation skills .

In today 's world , due to the great comfort of cars , public transport is likely to disappear .
Firstly , is it true that cars are the faster mode of transport .
In addition , the car is one of the means most used , not only for its speed , but also because the cost of public transport is increasing every year .
From my point of view , many people use cars owing to the awful quality of some buses , trains …
We should also consider the fact that , nowadays , life is so busy that we ca n't waste our time taking public transport .
However , cars can cause some problems like traffic jams and accidents that could be avoided by using public transport .
To conclude , it seems to me that it is fine to use cars sometimes , but if the quality of public transport was better , the amount of pollution and accidents would decrease .
In recent years , many regions of the world have faced an issue with water scarcity that may affect their development , especially for those countries suffering from poverty .
This essay will analyse the problem of water scarcity in Australia and recommend some viable solutions .
It will examine responses including the recycling of water , the development of technology for purifying ocean water and multinational sharing of water resources .
Recycling waste water is an effective method to solve the water scarcity problem .
This is because there is a huge level of water use in people 's daily lives , they just need to be collected to filter waste parts .
However , the use of recycled water for daily routines is less common , because many people are repelled by the thought of water that comes from our toilets or drains .
For example , the recycled water can be utilized to water plants in a garden , but if it is clear enough , residents only need to heat it to wash dishes or even drink it .
Thus , states should make it possible to purify waste water to a satisfactory safety level .
In addition , developing the latest technology in purifying ocean water can be regarded as a viable alleviation strategy .
As is well known , about 70 per cent of the earth 's surface is covered by ocean water , so every region surrounded by ocean , like Australia , makes the most of the ocean water resource to release the pressure of fresh water needs .
Although , governments are likely to face economic stress initially , which means they have to invest more money in upgrading technology instead of other fields such as education , infrastructure and medical care , this strategy could affect inhabitants ' physical health and promote their standard of living .
In this way , drought regions will obtain enough time and technical aid to overcome water problems .
Although over - shared water resources could lead to violence and even international tension , few countries have suffered these problems .
In conclusion , water shortage has presented a challenge to individual lives and the global environment .
While these approaches are likely to solve the problem partially , they might have a positive impact on water shortage in the long term .
You may not have ever thought about it , but you ///would///could///might/// be able to jump from a plane if you wanted .
If you ask me why I enjoy my favourite sport so much , I would n't hesitate to answer .
First of all , the best thing about skydiving is the excitement and the rush of adrenalin .
When you are sitting in the plane next to your instructor , with your legs hanging and your arms crossed … It makes an indescribable impression on you .
Finally , you are around 4000 meters high and after 60 seconds of free fall at 200 km / hour , your parachute is opened and you are flying about 5 minutes until you land on the ground .
As you can imagine , there is some advice that you should follow if you want to take it up .
I 'm sure you will agree that it could be one of your best experiences if you pay attention to your instructor all the time .
Plus , you should wear a sweater or jacket to avoid being cold because you are flying in the sky , above the clouds .
And obviously , you should n't be afraid of heights to enjoy skydiving fully .
Facial expression is said to be more important for film actors , whereas body language and voice intonation are paid more attention to in stage acting .
Besides , camera work , props and special effects deserve to be called silver screen features , while stage acting requires actors to convey their play through body movements and energy .
It is evident that those types of acting are different and the actors should adapt to the conditions they work in in one way or another .
But let 's take a closer look at what performance capabilities they have and might use while acting .
The stage actor is armed with props , costumes and light like the film actor .
So , I would say those types of acting are equal in terms of external factors .
Regarding acting techniques , stage actors do use their body language as much as film actors .
The only thing that differs is that the film actor has several takes as opposed to the stage actor who has to play perfectly at one dash .
And controlling your voice is also important for film actors , in spite of having the support of audio operators , they still have to deal with the same problems as stage actors , that is keeping your vocal expressions in compliance with the acting , resonate moving , communicate the emotions and feelings of their character .
The key point is that the whole range of techniques makes these acting performances perfect .
I would say , it does n't matter whether you are performing on the stage or in front of the camera , you should use your facial expression , body language , intonation and timbre of voice as if you 're acting your main character , embody all their traits and features appropriately to the situation .
Furthermore , people actively use private transport such as cars , motorbikes , scooters and bicycles .
Tourists can encounter difficulties such as a traffic jam .
Sometimes it is very difficult to come home in the rush hour because of traffic jams .
There are some disadvantages to banning cars .
This idea also would be unpopular because it limits freedom of choice .
In my view , the best solution to all problems would be the limiting of private transport in the centre , but not absolute banning .
Firstly , the article ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ' shows new research , in which it 's possible to pick up some of the signs of dyslexia in the brain even before kids learn how to read .
In addition , using this identification may help parents , educators and clinicians to tackle the learning disorder .
Secondly , the article ' ' Innovative ' Intervention Helps Babies at High Risk of Autism ' is based on video - therapy which improves the interaction between parents and autism - related babies in a way that would help develop the children 's communication abilities and social engagement .
All in all , if you want to read about effective research with very strong proposals , I recommend reading ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ' .
Tom had joined a volunteering team at St. Michael 's Hospital and this was his first day .
He would deal with temporarily disabled people who came for a rehabilitation session every other day .
Tom 's role was to conduct a focus group once per week to explore the people 's experience and perception of their illness and the service given to them at the rehabilitation center .
The ultimate aim was to get feedback for service - improvement purposes .
Tom had prepared a set of questions to ask .
He then introduced himself and made a clear statement about the objective of the focus group and assured them that their identity would not be revealed .
We all know the situation , when we are in the supermarket standing in front of two products which are the same , but one of them costs much more than the other .
Here we have branded products and no - name products .
Now the question is , whether it is really justified that branded products are much more expensive than no - name products .
Most people associate branded products automatically with higher quality or better taste , while they think no - name products are just cheap and without any quality and poor taste .
In surveys , it was asked if consumers would rather buy branded products or no - name products .
Most of the consumers said they would buy branded products .
After that , the consumers did a blind taste test .
The product without a brand tasted better to nearly everybody .
As a result , we can say it is not always justified that branded products are more expensive than other comparable ones .
Only the brand and the good marketing make it that expensive , not better quality or better taste .
The effect of the media on people is clearly noticeable here .
It is like " Everybody has it . I need it too ! "
In some cases , it may be true that branded products are better than no - names . For example technology products , but products like Red Bull or others like that , are definitely not always better .
Here it is said , try and find out which is really the better one and do not trust advertisements .
We had won three free plane tickets to Rome in a competition , and we had been looking forward to our trip for months .
The passport was ready in an hour , so we hurried to the gate and got on the plane .
You do n't have to worry about getting to my house , because it 's really simple , and I 'm helping you make it even more simple by picking you up at the train station in my town .
The underground is in the airport and it 's very easy to get to because you just have to follow the signs .
Once you 're in the train station , go to where they sell tickets and buy one for Viterbo .
Get the train and jump off at the " Viterbo " stop - I will be right outside of the station waiting for you !
In this period it 's mostly sunny and warm , but in the evening it gets a little cold and windy , so bring some jumpers or sweaters ...
That 's why I think that waiting in queues is essential in any place .
Otherwise , the place would turn into a mess , especially crowded places .
It may seem boring and time wasting to wait in queues , but it is n't .
Also , that makes them do their jobs efficiently .
In conclusion , people will do what they want smoothly and politely if they wait patiently in queues .
I 'm Sara and I 'm a half Italian , half Spanish , seventeen - year - old girl with a really cheerful , energetic and hardworking personality .
I saw this advertisement on a website and I instantly thought it would be a really great experience for me to improve my English , but also a great way to show how responsible and caring I am .
I love children and it would n't be annoying for me to take care of a group of little monsters and organize sports and activities for them . Actually , I think I would really enjoy it and my day would end with a tired smile , but a very bright smile .
I 've never had any experience of this kind before , but I have a brother three years younger than me and a little cousin who 's seven years old with whom I usually play a lot when I do n't have to study .
I 'm constantly brainstorming to find everything that could be challenging for me and I usually try to follow what my mind brings up , so I think I could come up with nice ideas for those children .
I started cooking when I was fourteen years old , but I 'm better at baking , so I could help by preparing some sweets for children .
They would obviously be as healthy as possible and I would be really careful about those children who have allergies , and try to bake something that they can eat too .
I speak English quite fluently and I scored 95 points out of 100 at both KET and PET .
English has also been my favorite language since I was a child . I started studying it at the age of three with a really nice teacher named Helen and I have continued improving my English by watching American movies and TV shows during the past few years .
Best regards
First , I started a new job . It did not turn out the way I hoped unfortunately .
My colleagues are nice but the management are terrible and recently I just stopped talking to them .
Perhaps it is not their fault that this entire operation is so dysfunctional .
While we might talk about our jobs a bit too much , I do n't think it is uncomfortable to work side by side .
I met some roleplayers at Wiscon and also some live roleplayers through Geek Network . Of these , the live roleplay looks promising .
Lastly , I hope next year will bring some stability .
While I do not wish to continue to work and live like this , I am not sure I want to move again .
But I ca n't imagine it can be as bad or worse than my current job .
If I move again , I know it will take another year to get to know other people at least .
I am not sure Vastervik has that kind of people .
Michael had always been a good boy : responsible , quiet , always on time and always the top of his class .
He closed the window so as not to hear the laughs and yells of his friends , playing soccer in the field in front of his house : " I never liked soccer , anyway " he kept telling himself , but the more he tried , the harder it got to focus on his book .
He felt like a character in a cartoon , with an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other , giving him opposite pieces of advice , and exactly like such a character , he did n't know who to listen to .
Suddenly , the doorbell rang , distracting him from his inner struggles , and he heard his Mother opening the door .
He stood up , hesitating for a few seconds , then glanced at his book once again and finally went out of his room and said " Please Mom , tell him I ca n't go out , I have to study . "
By a broad definition , teachers are the people who teach you .
If parents want to get these abilities , they need to spend extra time to learn them .
Because everyone has their own talents , values , and judgments , we learn more from those with whom we agree and who we appreciate and get significant influence from .
These people can be deemed as the best teachers in our life , even if these people , perhaps , are not our parents .
The reason for my choice is simple and clear : the French revolution was the turning point in modern European history and , thanks to its achievements , people in the twenty - first century can enjoy civil rights such as freedom of speech , assembly , worship and , the most important one , freedom of thought .
It is difficult to think about Paris without its Eiffel tower ( it was built several years after the revolution ) , but I 'm sure it was a gorgeous city , as it is nowadays .
I imagine its streets crowded with workers and peasants that have been called to support the revolution .
They meet at midnight to listen to the speeches of the leaders .
I would do my best to make their imprisonment less hard and , above all , I 'd try to convince the Parliament not to sentence them to the death penalty .
Because no revolution is worth more than a human life .
Thank you very much again for helping me get the tickets for the concert in London , but unfortunately I have bad news for you today .
But only until yesterday ! My professor told us that our final exam on this course would be on July 5th .
As you know , I 'm not the best student and I 've already failed this exam twice , so there is only one more chance and I have to take it this semester .
Otherwise , I will be taken off the university register .
To be honest , I got really mad at him because I really wanted to go to London and I also already got tickets for my flight .
You do n't know how embarrassed I feel now , not only because you helped me to get the tickets ( and I can imagine how difficult it must have been ) , but also because you have already arranged everything to make my stay in London as comfortable and enjoyable as possible .
Do you maybe have a friend who you would like to go to the concert with since we ca n't go together ?
I would let you have the ticket so at least you have the chance to enjoy that event even if it is n't with me .
Otherwise , I could sell both tickets and we can have a look and see if we want to go to the same concert here in Germany .
I have been proving my abilities by overcoming strong competition since I chose this career as a lawyer and researcher complying with my passion for persuasion and problem solving .
Throughout my undergraduate studies , my professional skills were recognized in internships at the Federal Court of Law and the most famous fiscal law office in the State .
During this period , I was the intern coordinator and I created a manual on the procedures employed by the entire court .
On the other hand , in recognition of my academic performance , I graduated with a Bachelor of Law with Great Honors in 2007 .
I was placed in the top 10 , with a GPA of 8.73 out of 10 .
My bachelor thesis , founded in Economic Law , was unanimously awarded by the jury with the maximum score of 10 .
Since my law school graduation , many achievements encouraged my professional development .
First , upon graduation , I immediately joined a highly recognized firm , performing the double role of legal consultant and sub - manager when I was only 22 years old .
In the same year , I passed the strenuous Brazilian bar exam with a remarkable score of 9 out of 10 .
After almost 2 years working in complex litigation , I had acquired the maturity to pursue an international career to work on internal and cross - border contracts .
Therefore , in order to acquire the excellence demanded , I specialized in Economic Law on a master 's degree at the University Paris 1 Panthéon - Sorbonne in 2009 .
Following my LLM graduation with magna cum laude in the top five , I enrolled for a PhD in International Economic Law at the University Paris 9 Dauphine in 2010 .
Due to my interest in law and economics , I developed a multidisciplinary research project applying economic analysis in contemplation of illustrating the mutual influence of rules and economic transactions on the legal certainty of transnational transactions .
I profoundly grasp the theoretical ascertainment for this career , which is that international trade requires rational economic decisions with legally binding consequences .
In conclusion , as an international legal professional , I must be prepared for alternative methods of dispute resolution regarding cross - border transactions , given the increasing requirement to look beyond domestic law to find appropriate solutions .
Furthermore , I already profoundly understand the importance of linguistics in the international sphere due to my experience as a foreign lawyer and as a teacher .
The LLM in International Business Regulation , Litigation and Arbitration at New York University is irrefutably the postgraduate program that I need to ensure the outcome desired .
Man has evolved over the years , from the invention of the wheel , to space craft expeditions .
Our species has achieved great things , but despite all the great discoveries , there is still one problem we have not been able to solve , a problem that has been haunting us since time immemorial : racism .
In the 19th century , slavery had been eradicated from America , but soon another problem grew up and took its place .
The movie " The Color Purple " displays a variety of situations for Afro - American people who suffered because of their skin color . This is known as racism , which can be defined as the prejudice or discrimination of one race against another .
In this period of time , the Caucasian race felt superior to the Afro - Americans . They had the power and they were in charge of the political and economic activity , while the Afro- Americans did the hard work ; as shown in the movie , most of the men were in charge of the crops .
They did not have a chance to receive any kind of education at all . It was absolutely forbidden , and that is why they could not aspire to more important jobs .
Afro - Americans were completely segregated . Caucasians found it impossible to live among them , and that is the main reason why each race had their own church and their houses were separated too .
Afro - Americans were afraid of raising their voices to express their opposition to the oppression they were suffering , and fighting to obtain equality was not an option because any sign of rebellion was cruelly punished .
Moreover , women in the Afro - American society were threatened in the most denigrating ways ; men were the undisputed authority in the house .
It makes me feel sad to realize that racism is still a problem from which society suffers . I wonder , why do we have the need to feel superior to other people ?
We are all equal in God 's eyes , and I believe we all have the same right to live a peaceful life based on mutual respect .
It had been a long and rainy day . Tom had been working all day and was very tired and hungry .
As usual , he decided to sit at the bar and order some fish and chips .
Surprised , he thought he had n't seen her for a long time .
As they talked they came to realize that they had been working in offices which were very near for almost a year .
First of all , our environment is polluted and if we are determined to save it , we should definitely stop using cars .
Although there are many other polluters , such as big industries , people should start with the easiest solutions .
Although many countries do not offer a good public transport service , once people get rid of cars , there will be more money for improvements .
For instance , Copenhagen and Vienna are good examples of this .
It seems like cars are losing the battle in this case , because these cities propagate the idea that riding bicycles can lead to a better future .
Unfortunately , not many people are prepared to renounce all the advantages a car provides .
For example , it is claimed that it is more convenient to travel by car than by bus because you can take breaks whenever you want to and they are more spacious .
It is a fight for a better and healthier future .
Dear colleague
About the task that you asked me to do . Unfortunately , I do n't have enough knowledge of LIMS yet .
I understand that the new programme has some specific requisites related to preservation of analysed samples .
Nevertheless , all the information that I send to you is based on the information that my colleagues from the wet chemistry laboratory and from the microbiology laboratory gave to me .
Of course , if you have any suggestions please tell me .
I will pass them on to them and we will discuss them .
Suppose we have a stock failure resulting from an increasing demand for a particular analysis .
International suppliers take at least a week to deliver an order .
It was a cold winter night and the moon was fighting the clouds for freedom , much like any of us fighting through our life and its obstacles .
Michael , however , made a living from his fights . At a young age , Michael was attacked and mugged in the street , so he started taking martial arts lessons lest he be attacked again .
If the demolition crew camp in front of my place again tomorrow , I 'll just show them the form ...
" he said , taking a pill . "
But then again , what good is a useless piece of paper ? " he panicked , putting the box on the night stand . He did n't even understand the passing of time !
Until he had calmed down enough to go feed his dog , his one best friend , the dog he and his fiancee bought before they broke up .
The labrador really took him back to his engagement ...
He was doing well , despite his sad life .
His anxiety caught up with him every now and then , but the good doctor had prescribed him a good remedy !
Suddenly , Michael heard a thud from his upstairs bedroom , he called Baxter and took a bat with him upstairs .
Michael rushed to his bedroom with a fatal mixture of fear and adrenaline in his system , only to see his box of pills on the ground and the sound of muffled but heavy breathing coming from behind the door .
Michael closed the door , saw his dog gasping for air , and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
It is well accepted that when you become a famous person you lose your privacy .
Whether you like it or not , right from the beginning , all you do becomes attractive to the mob : what you eat , where you go , who you date , your possible marriage , your holidays , etc .
I agree with the fact that as soon as their life is not private anymore , famous people have to face journalists with a smile they do not have .
I mean by this that , for sure , there are some days on which these famous people are in a bit of a mood , they have to visit the doctor , or they have to solve mishaps with lawyers , and they have to put up with those journalists following them to the door or waiting for them stationed in front of their houses .
In these cases , journalists themselves should realize that they are taking it too far and that they should respect them a bit more .
During this period , the town has seen extensive growth in residential areas and local amenities , and the modernisation of leisure facilities .
Parks in the north - east and south - east have been reduced to make way for larger housing estates , the one in the north dramatically increasing accommodation in Eastminister .
South of the river , an industrial area has been constructed next to the existing railway , while residential streets have been converted into more modern apartment blocks .
With increasing housing has come a bigger hospital and more shopping facilities , the existing shops being built on the site of the old school , with a new school opening on the north bank of the river .
I like the way you gave examples of how you felt and how you would change your own lessons .
However , when I was reading your article I felt ashamed due to the fact that when every teacher teaches the way I do it is logical that our students ca n't be quiet and ca n't sit without making a movement .
Moreover , when we as teachers have a study day , I get tired myself from sitting all day .
In my opinion , I am very patient and willing to explain difficult topics over and over again .
as I see it , it is my job to clarify things and help my pupils to understand .
Your experience gave me food for thought especially when you wrote that our pupils are sitting passively and listening for approximately 90 per cent of their classes .
I teach at Basisberoeps level and I have already started to use some activities where they must use an Ipad and make pictures or short films .
However , I find it difficult to use activities every lesson because they are time - consuming .
Although the main reason that prevents me from using them is my colleagues .
For instance , when I hear that another English teacher finished Unit 5 and I am still at Unit 4 , I feel incompetent .
It gives me the feeling that the most important part of teaching is doing all the exercises in the book and getting all the work done .
Maybe you understand this discrepancy between activating pupils and the pressure of the school board for the best test results .
She was walking around the city thinking about the job she just got .
Yes , she should accept this offer .
Everything was looking perfect and it was something she enjoyed doing before the accident took place .
But then something went wrong and she just walked away .
He made her feel bad , so why would she not do the same ?
But it was okay .
The dark clouds in the sky , full of life , seemed to mock his weak desire to live .
He could hear thunder shouting with rage , a rage he wished he could feel again .
He stared at an object on the beside table , the object that could free him from this hellish existence .
Could bliss be found in death ?
Was it the best thing life could offer ?
Its own end ?
He placed a hook over the door , tied the object to it and , standing on a chair , put the object around his neck .
He looked at the clouds , they were still grey , and then for a moment , he saw a tiny fragment of a rainbow .
This is an easy word to understand , but it hides more than the definition says .
All people need these things and the best givers are family members because they give unconditionally .
My family members all the time express their warm feelings with hugs , kisses and beautiful words .
For example , my parents hug me every day .
My mother makes me breakfast every morning and my brother brings me cookies when I am in a bad mood .
These small things give me a lot .
Also , they always support me , no matter what I do or think .
Ordinary friends can often say " no " or let me down , but my family never does that .
My family knows most of my secrets , they know my worries and joys , they know what I think about things .
They fulfill all the functions that my friends have , and they fulfill them even better .
As a result , some sources of energy like nuclear power are used in our daily life .
Fossil fuels are our most common energy source , even though they have a terrible effect on global warming on account of releasing gases into the atmosphere .
Just look at oil , nature takes millions of years to form it and we have almost used it up .
Nuclear power plants have a high risk of pollution in the event of an accident .
In addition , they produce nuclear waste , which is a major problem for the environment and public health .
All things considered , I believe that renewable energy will be the most common energy in the future as it does n't cause global warming although it is expensive to generate .
No , it is not rational because according to economic theory , you should spend your money on those goods which yield the maximum utility per dollar .
If MUx / Px is less than MUy / Py , then it is the consumer 's duty to buy more of Y. If MUy / Py is less than MUx / Px , then the consumer must use more of X. If you work more , you can consume more , each additional unit yielding additional , marginal utility , so you continually increase the sum of your total utility .
She may be right about that treadmill because there is a cycle in which consumption results from work which necessitates further consumption , but theory would indicate that this is a positive , self - perpetuating cycle , because increased consumption yields increased utility , therefore maximizing utility .
Ms. Luhr 's dissatisfaction with her current status in our society must come from her failure to vary her consumption of a variety of material goods .
In my view , Ms. Luhr is succumbing to her emotions rather than her logic , because everyone knows that increased work yields increased wealth and increased utility , and this is the ultimate goal of a rational person who is acting selfishly , which is how economists think people act .

In this way , I would have the chance to spend my holidays in your enjoyable country and study at the same time .

Hans Feurer has been a mainstay of fashion photography since the late 1960s .
The peak of his career was in the early 80s , after the legendary Kenzo Takedo 's advertising campaign .
In 1967 , Feurer 's career went up like a rocket .
At the same time , he worked for the Pirelli calendar in 1974 he also featured shots that appeared in Elle , Vogue , Numero , etc .
The career of a Somali - American fashion model , Iman , also began after this pioneering shoot .
These images became the subject of Feurer 's eponymous book , lavishly illustrated with 175 photographs , illustrating his five - decade - long career .
Weight lifting involves the basic and most natural human movements .
Obviously , the weight is the resistance , which will help the individual to gain strength and mass .
Every time I go to the gym , I feel like I have to break my limitations and replace them with the feeling of success .
The best advice I can give for a newbie is to not go to the gym at all without knowledge .
Look up on the Internet how to do the exercises properly .
Eating healthy foods is the other part of that sport .
I prefer to call that a lifestyle .
Each weightlifter gets three attempts at each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category .
Conversely , the Bronte sisters are influenced by the preceding Romantic works , and their novels contain Gothic elements such as ghosts and a dark ominous atmosphere .
If their themes are considered , it is immediately clear that Dickens builds an extraordinary image of Victorian society , with a wide range of characters and stories which reveal the conditions of children and the poor ; whereas the Brontes ' novels contain the Byronic hero , a male figure with a dark past who wants to find some revenge , in the case of Heatcliff in " Wuthering Heights " or forgiveness in the case of Mr Rochester in " Jane Eyre " .
PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR ENGLISH COURSE
The aim of this report is to inform the committee about the wishes of the students who took part in the survey that was conducted last week in our school .
However , there are some shortcomings that could be fixed .
Firstly , there is a great demand among our students for a computer room with broadband Internet connection .
It is well known that this kind of facility helps students make the most of their time while learning English .
Not only are the bedrooms rather small , but they are also quite cold , because of the lack of a heating system .
There are also numerous complaints with regards to the quality of the food offered in the canteen .
It would be advisable to change the catering service .
We would be grateful if any of these problems were solved by the committee .
In case you need further information regarding any of these issues , please contact us and I will be glad to respond to you as soon as possible .
Maybe if you could just reduce the time you spend on each of your activities , it could work out and you would n't need to drop any of them .
However , if you are still very stressed , then you should drop one of them . I certainly do n't know which one you should drop . I think I would drop the music lessons , because sports are good for your physical and mental health , and also help you to keep fit and it 's more interesting for me ; but maybe a list with the pros and cons of sports and music lessons can help you .
Start by asking yourself which one you like the most ?
Environmental problems today are more worrisome , if we do not do something for our planet , in a few years we will suffer the consequences .
No time to speculate , it is time to act and implement all these measures we know .
Enough talk , it is time to make a decision : do we want a better world , or , do we want to see it destroyed in a few years .
Simple things like recycling garbage , walking short distances instead of using cars , not throwing garbage on the streets or into the oceans , can mean a considerable change , because if we add the small efforts of each of us , the results will be translated into millions of people .
I recommend implementing a campaign called " No more blah blah blah , it 's time to save the world " , we may not have superpowers and not be " Superman , Ironman , Captain America , Batman , etc . " and we ca n't save the planet from intergalactic threat , but unlike them , all together , we can save the planet from an even greater threat : its total destruction due to pollution and environmental problems that we ourselves have caused .
Just as we have the courage to cause problems , we have to have the courage to do something to fix them . Let us become that superhero that changed the world and made a change for future generations to have a healthy environment to live in .
Just think about your future and your family , and when you see rubbish lying in the street , remember that you can become the superhero that will someday be satisfied because he did something to save the planet .
It 's time to bring out the superhero we have inside ; good luck !
The variety of cafes and clubs would appeal to a great number of foreigners owing to the fast service and the proper attitude to clients .
They would also enjoy our museums and galleries , which can bring them closer to our history and traditions .
More students would be attracted if the school governors made some changes to the learning system .
I recommend that a more common teaching method should be one - to - one lessons , namely teacher with only one student , as that will contribute to increasing the range of their knowledge and will also be beneficial for students who need more help in a particular subject .
Therefore , it is necessary to provide new facilities in the classrooms .
Computer - based learning would be a great idea to attract more foreign students because that will maximize their technological capabilities , so that more work will be implemented .
Improvements to socialising opportunities
The school governors should offer more extra - curricular activities , including organising excursions in the local area and giving students a chance to choose the school course which appeals to them the most .
I would recommend implementing all the suggestions listed above because these improvements will increase the number of foreign students , making their accommodation in the town more pleasant .
I know plenty of amazing English courses but they all have different prices .
I 've seen a couple of advertisements for English courses in our town , but they do n't seem very useful .
However , if you want to have a look at them , they are put up in the supermarket .
I 've got a cousin who works as an English teacher and she has an academy right next to the city hall .
You can choose the time and the days you would like to go and she has fantastic offers if you do not want to spend a huge amount of money .
I leave you her mobile number in case you need it : 681234567 .
However much Roman law , Mosaic law , and rabbinical law impacted the lives of Jews living in first - century Israel , many people who followed the religion of Israel lived outside of Palestine and beyond the borders of the Roman Empire .
The metaphor the Bible uses to express this relationship is covenant .
While the metaphor comes from the sphere of international law , it is wrong to understand the commandments merely as a summary of Israel 's obligations towards God . . .
Isreal 's obedience to commandments was not a matter of submission to the divine will as much as it was a response to love .
I always go to have a pizza at a restaurant near my house . "
La Terrazza " is the classic Neapolitan restaurant that makes pizza and all the Neapolitan specialties , and all the types of fried ? .
It uses only fresh ingredients from Naples that are brought there every day .
The place is reminiscent of the atmosphere of the little alleyways of Naples , with pictures of the most famous Neapolitan people on the wall .
You can sit there and wait for your pizza while watching the football match or take your pizza home .
The owner , Patrizio , is really nice and you can often find him in the restaurant talking to some guest .
I think it could be suitable for my class because it has two rooms and one of them is always used for big groups of people , like us . The service is really fast and in front of the restaurant there 's a beautiful square where we can have a drink while watching the typical Neapolitan evening .
Obviously , everyone loves pizza , so it 's the perfect place .
But , in fact , the car provides much better mobility , both in the big cities and in the countryside .
Our daily life is thoroughly planned , from morning to night .
We must keep doing our day - to - day tasks at work and at home , and , at the same time , maintain our social life and entertainment activities .
Modern life orders our days and weeks in a packed schedule of activities : job , children , housework , fun , free time ...
We have to go quickly from one place to another , just to be in time to fulfil our next task or activity .
It 's because of that we need to improve our mobility and private transport , such as a car , allows us to achieve our goals more efficiently .
But , on the other hand , travelling by car gives us more comfort and saves time , and it offers a wider range of choices of departure points and routes .
Every day , science and industry are developing new materials , technologies and clean energy sources .
As industrial and technological development progresses , public transport will lose passengers and the use of private cars will spread everywhere around the world .
Only then can you really start to speak .
When you are on holiday , try to make contact with other English speakers , and who knows ?
I find watching TV programmes in English and reading increase my exposure to new words , and help me recycle words I know in new contexts .
This is a very common argument : true genius stands out so much that it can not be misunderstood , so if he is not recognized , then he is not a genius .
But this is faulty reasoning : it accepts the idea that a genius is always recognized on the basis that , in history , geniuses have always been recognized - which is not true , or at least , is not demonstrable .
They take for granted that , historically , geniuses have always been recognized , but in reality they are only talking about geniuses that , in fact , have been recognized .
They know nothing of those who have not been recognized and that may have been completely erased from history , and therefore , can not be used as an opposite example .
In the 19th century , for some , such as Cesare Lombroso , genius resembles mental illness .
For Lombroso , exceptional people are independent , away from the banality of life , isolated , impatient , asocial , often considered crazy .
The time at university is the most important time in our lives , because we learn a lot of things and it prepares us for our future career .
Some may think that it is better to have classes with discussion between professor and student . Others may disagree .
They prefer classes with lectures and almost no discussion .
In my opinion , classes with discussion are better .
First , classes with discussion between professor and student have an advantage for the students because they learn how to interact with their fellow students .
Doubtless , such interactions with other people will help you to broaden your mind and learn new things .
For instance , a year back , I was at North Texas university in the USA . There was a health management and policy class with almost no lectures but with a lot of time for open discussions .
In the beginning , I thought this was a disadvantage but this was not true .
On one day , we spoke about medical treatment costs in different countries and one of my friends , Wole , was from Nigeria .
Consequently , he was able to tell us how the cost of treatment is less , how doctors are dedicated , and how everybody has access to primary health care .
As a result , we all know what needs to be done so that we can make little changes in the reform to reduce the cost of treatment .
As you can see , open discussion in class is really important since it broadens your horizon and helps you to understand different nation s ' policies .
Second , open discussion in class helps you to develop certain skills in order to become an independent thinker and speaker .
In order to get good grades , we are forced to participate in discussion .
As a result , I overcame my anxiety and started speaking in front of those students and I found it 's not as difficult as I expected .
This experience taught me that it is better to participate in a class with open discussion because it provides you with speaking and thinking abilities which are imperative for your career .
All in all , though some may oppose my opinion , it is clear that classes with open discussion and almost no lectures are preferable because interaction with other students will broaden your mind and you become a better speaker and thinker .
with reference to your job announcement , I am submitting my application for the vacancy at Green Pepper Cafe .
Being a student of economics in this town ( expecting to graduate next year ) , I am currently searching for a job at weekends .
Your job description sounds to be a good fit for my search , since I am very experienced at serving guests and have a good knowledge of various kinds of foods .
My tasks included back office administration and serving in the hotel 's restaurant .
Being ranked in the Michelin guide , this restaurant provides more than 50 different dishes .
I love serving customers and dealing with different and complex situations .
Should you require further information , I will be happy to provide it .
I hope you 're OK , by the way .
It 's an excellent idea . Of course we should go . I bet there are lots of things to do so we can have a great time .
Well , all your suggestions sound good to me . However , I would probably choose climbing because not only is it an extreme sport , but it is also an exciting activity I would like to try .
About Saturday evening . Why do n't we just stay at home and watch some One Direction videos ?
I do n't know if my parents will be here on Friday , I 'm afraid they wo n't , they 've been working so much !
He stared at the clock hanging on the wall and frowned .
It was late , and there was a lot of work to do , so he 'd better get up .
By the time he arrived at the riverbank , some of his colleagues were already digging the ditch .
The river was flowing down with great noise , and its level was slowly rising , as had been happening for the last few days .
The crops might be flooded very soon if they did n't do something to avoid it .
They worked all day long , without rest , until they were breathless and their hands were bleeding .
He gazed at it , a bit worried about the possibility of more rain during the night , but proud of having put the farm in shelter .
We human beings are highly socialized creatures in the world .
Therefore , it is inevitable that we have to learn to be part of society .
However , considering the complexity of society , I believe it is better to learn in schools rather than from parents .
First of all , there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental life skills on which their progeny count .
For example , one of my senior high school classmates encountered a communication problem in his family .
As a consequence , they have never talked to each other since then .
Following the previous paragraph , there will always be people with different lifestyles , attitudes , and beliefs in every aspect of one 's life .
If we have not lived and learned the skills in a group , especially in school , we will not be skilled before entering society .
Society as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turns to continuously influence every member .
In contrast , living in a society is another story : people might blame , compete , or even hurt others , no matter who you are .
Learning in schools , however , provides a valuable opportunity for children to learn not only from teachers , but also from relationships between peers , and as a result , paves the way for being independent in the future .
In a nutshell , there is a great deal of knowledge that needs to be acquired by children in order to live in society .
School , a place with diverse students along with diverse attitudes towards life , might be better than merely learning with parents .
Although it 's true that I do n't actually love sports , once I found golf , it totally engaged me !
By playing golf you can enjoy a wonderful journey in contact with nature and even with some friends , while you do some healthy , constant and not too tiring exercise !
If you like the great views from a high hill , as well as having a relaxing time by yourself or sharing it with other people , golf is the perfect sport for you .
The only disadvantage I could find is that golf is n't such a cheap sport to do , as it requires a lot of expense and also good mental and psychological health , which is the first thing I recommend you to work on if you want to enjoy golf from the beginning .
I totally encourage you to try it at least once and I 'm sure you will want to repeat it !
It slowly rustles and clatters and its pulsing waves attract so much that you ca n't stand sitting still much longer and you are ready to throw up everything and run towards it .
Long before our journey I knew that I would love this country , I would fall in love with the ocean and sea once and for all .
I was wrong about only one thing : I had loved it long ago .
I had been adoring the sea and dreaming about it when I had never seen it before , never heard it before , but definitely felt it not with my skin but with my heart .
The main advantage of it is that the ocean is always near to hand , no matter in what part of the town you are .
Like in all seaside towns , it 's always windy there .
So , that 's why I gave up the idea of doing it and decided to be a shaggy - girl .
Also , I remember the sweet perfume of Spaniards ( and Spain itself ) , spreading through the streets of the old town and mixing with the smell of fried fish that is ready to be served in numerous bars , cafes and restaurants .
I remember the warmth of twilight , which lures you to the heart of this town .
I remember the laughter of people , sitting at the tables and chatting .
I remember children , running about the small squares in front of the cathedrals ; elderly people in wheelchairs ...
All these memories are always with me , and to go through them again I do n't even need to close my eyes , everything in my mind and heart is too vivid to forget .
A language is the great thing to learn because it is the way people communicate and organize their thoughts .
Furthermore , it gives you the chance to enjoy works written in that language .
Nevertheless , when you are learning a language , it brings confusion .
On the one hand , the old one could be hard - wired into your brain .
It also has another negative effect : you have limited time on this planet .
There is an incredible amount of things to learn .
Why would you waste your time learning a new language , when you probably do not know enough about your own ?
But , as a learner of my third language , I am a firm believer that it is the right choice .
We are delighted to inform you that the charity dinner was a success .
We raised € 44,500.00 and we are really grateful for your attendance at our event .
We will use the money to build another educational building , and we are going to invest in the program that we did last year .
We would like to say thank you for your presence at the event . We are delighted because you chose to promote our educational program . We are pretty sure that your presence helped a lot to promote this program with the new students .
No change ; no life . Nature is life and death , construction and destruction .
No change ; no nature .
To stop the change is impossible . That would be against nature and against ourselves .
Every single word causes a gesture , a thought , a change in others .
Any decision changes the future .
Life and change also have a direction , an aim : growth .
To inhibit the growth of a living being is cruelty , but sometimes it happens .
Think of those Chinese women obliged to bind their feet .
It is equally cruel , in my opinion , to accelerate the pace of growth by forcing children to work like adults or by inducing little girls to dress and behave like femmes fatales in video - clips or on magazine covers .
Nature is also change , but in a cyclical direction , and with a natural rhythm : the movement of celestial bodies , the rotation of Earth , the alternation of days and nights , the sequence of seasons … , in short , the wheel of life .
We live in a time of accelerated changes .
Technology allows us to do and learn in one lifetime more things than our ancestors were able to in several generations .
But at the same time , we are working against nature - let 's think of pollution and climate change - and against our own human nature : distress , allergies , strokes and heart attacks are more and more frequent nowadays .
Shopping is very important to people .
But some people can get annoyed by this kind of activity . They may be irritated by loud music in the shopping areas , long queues at the cash desk , and crowds of customers everywhere .
I do n't belong to any of these groups , because I am not addicted to shopping , but I do love the process of choosing clothes , shoes and accessories . I hate going shopping with my father as he is always advising me to buy stupid stuff .
Actually , this is a bad idea , because I must not waste money on things that are not worth buying .
My name is Alex Yegorov and I am writing to request information about qualification requirements for obtaining a skills assessment in order to submit my Expression of Interest to SkillSelect .
I would appreciate it if you could send me the necessary applications forms and associated information relating to the assessment .
It would be appreciated if you could provide assessment procedures , time frames and charges as well .
I graduated from University with a specialisation in Fiber - optic Transmission Systems .
However , now I am working and planning to continue working as a Software Engineer ( 261313 ) .
Would Telecommunications Engineer ( 263311 ) be the right occupation for me ?
Also , may I have information on which version of the IELTS exam I should take ; the Academic or the General Version ?
The European Union was created and is meant to be an organization that helps all of its members to develop economically and socially while contributing to the common good of the whole union itself .
It works towards allowing all EU citizens to travel and work freely no matter which country they are from .
Everyone must be accepted and integrate into a specific society .
There should be a working network for providing suitable jobs and standards of living for those , of course , who are looking to work and contribute to society , and do not simply expect to lay on the back of more economically developed countries .
Many non - EU citizens live and work in Europe , but for this to be successful they have to be able to integrate into their receiving society .
In 2015 , after 30 years of service in the Church of the Sacred Heart in Peluzuchampa , north of Bolivia , the priest Inocencio Raudales , 66 years old , realized that the wine drunk at the moment of communion is not the true blood of Jesus Christ , as he has thought for his whole life .
" I realized this fact last December when I cut my finger while I was cooking and I sucked the blood that was flowing from the wound " .
Inocencio , surprised by this discovery , asked his colleagues in the Order of Saint Bartolo about the taste of their blood . Incredibly , after a needlestick in their fingers , all the priests from the congregation agreed that their blood did not taste like the wine converted into holy blood at the church .
At that time , the Order sent to the Vatican an urgent message and called the press to make an announcement of the discovery .
At this press conference , Inocencio assured that next year he will try to prove if pigeons truly represent the Holy Spirit .
I 'm pleased to hear from you again ! I have to say that you should write in your work that the traditional Portuguese food is delicious !
Usually my eating habits are similar to most Portuguese ; I have my breakfast between around 7.30 and 8.00 . I eat bread with cheese or jam and I drink a large glass of milk with cereals .
At lunch , many people eat a lot ! I start with a small soup and then I have the main dish and the dessert .
In the afternoon , I eat some cookies .
It 's pork which is seasoned with red wine and , then , well braised .
He was always doing things for them or for anyone who asked him .
He lived in Toronto , which is a cold city , but which is even colder at 5 am , the time when Tom 's day began .
His first stop was the garage where he had to pay and pick up his friend Rob 's car .
The price was supposed to be 10 pounds , but it ended up being 25 pounds , so Tom had to pay money from his own pocket .
As a consequence , he had no money to pay for a sod , so he was thirsty all morning .
After taking the car out of the garage , he had to drive all the way to the airport and wait for Rob to arrive .
Tom was getting really anxious , worrying that he would never make it back to his job . At 2 pm , the flight arrived .
It was a quarter to two , so Tom lay back in his chair , took a deep breath and waited for his workmates to arrive .
It is one of the most significant places in our capital , Moscow .
First of all , I would like to make it clear that " red " is not related to the colour only . This word also means " beautiful " in Russian .
Also , in Red Square one can see the Mausoleum , which is can also be called one of the symbols of our capital and the country .
It seems to me that the following definitions show an overall context of what cultural literacy is .
Cultural literacy is knowing about and respecting the cultures of others .
To be familiar with something is far different from being an expert in it , and it 's entirely achievable .
According to UNESCO , literacy is at the heart of basic education for all and creating literate environments and societies is essential for achieving the goals of eradicating poverty , reducing child mortality , curbing population growth , achieving gender equality and achieving sustainable development , peace and democracy .
My personal opinion is that cultural literacy is the way to understand , learn and know about other cultures .
Also , you can be understood by other cultures .
Nowadays , the majority of teenagers are not so close to their families as they used to be and mostly they are further apart from their parents .
The age between 13 and 19 is the revolutionary one .
I get along with my siblings very well , but we do not see each other very much .
Not to mention that when I am trying to talk to them , they always space out and then say that they have their own problems .
A friend will stay on and listen to you with patience .
To sum up , I do not consider my family to be my best friends and neither do they .
I think it is fair to say basketball is one of the most popular sports on the planet , both in the number of viewers and the number of players .
There is probably an array of reasons to explain such a phenomenon , but for me , that happens for one particular reason ; the shot clock .
The shot clock is a timer that dictates the amount of time during which one team can keep possession of the ball .
The idea behind it is to quicken the pace of the game and prevent it from becoming stalled .
A curious fact is that , out of the five most popular sports in the world , only basketball keeps track of possession time and to me that 's exactly what sets it apart from the others .
While watching or playing any kind of sport , there 's nothing worse than a team or a player trying to waste time until the clock runs out , the game becomes dull and boring and you ca n't enjoy the excitement that only the up - tempo style of play can provide .
The bottom line is ; a fast - paced game is a much more exciting experience for players and viewers than a slow paced one and that makes the " shot clock " fundamental to the dynamics of the game .
And for anyone trying to become a good basketball player , the two most important things to understand ( as it is for most sports in general ) are the values of practice and awareness .
Practice is the one thing that can increase the probability of desirable results and awareness is what gives you the ability to adapt to different situations , and the combination of the two is the only way to success . So if you want to be a good player , you need to put your energy and focus on practice and stay alert and survey the court at all times so you can be aware of what is happening around you .
Some people claim that the youth of today are less healthy than they were two decades ago .
Although several causes of this problem can be found in the modernisation of our society , this modern society can also provide solutions for the amelioration of the level of fitness of young people .
However , possibilities to make young people healthier are also provided by our modern civilisation .
For example , commercials can be used to encourage youngsters to take up exercise by showing the positive effects .
In conclusion , I feel that not only the reason for the low level of fitness of today 's youth , but also the clue to getting youngsters fitter , lies in modernity .
Good thrillers have become increasingly rare in the last few years , and to find some among big productions casting famous actors is even harder , if not impossible .
Most of these , in fact , have very predictable plots , are full of cliches and , since it 's so easy to figure out how they will end , they are usually very boring .
This is why I was very surprised when I came out of the theater after seeing " Looper " and thought , " Hey , I just saw a thriller with Bruce Willis in it , and it was actually a really good one ! "
The story is set in the future , about thirty years from now , when time travel has been invented but is used only by criminal organizations who send those they want killed into the past , where a professional killer , a looper , is waiting for them and for the silver strapped to their body .
By letting his older self go , Joe changes his past , and therefore his future , leading to a series of unexpected events , and to an even more unexpected ending !
My expectations were not very high , but I have to say the movie was surprisingly good . In fact , it was not boring at all , and had a few big twists which took me completely by surprise .
Time travelling is only a means to the development of the story , and the future society is quite similar to the present one , so even if you are not big science fiction fans , I suggest you give this movie a chance . I am sure you wo n't be disappointed .
In the competitive world that we inhabit , mastering a technique and having a deep knowledge of a given field is essential for both academic and professional success .
The inherent tendency to provide the best to our offspring causes parents to invest in their children so as to prepare them for an unpredictable future .
The haste that results from this process does n't allow parents to think over some potentially harmful myths that they take for reality , regardless of the fact that it may compromise their children 's motivation and self - confidence , all because of their " is talent innate or can it be acquired ? " .
Contemporarily , the most widespread belief is that some people are born with a talent and some unlucky ones simply are n't .
This assertion may boost the confidence of parents whose children show a remarkable ability in early infancy , as though this capability could be a celestial sign that their toddler is gifted or going to grow up as child prodigy .
The adherents of this idea usually mention extraordinary people in order to reinforce their own belief in their child 's potential to become a famous genius .
Little known is what the role played by music was in his life and what his relationship with it was prior to his first deed .
Admittedly , I do n't know this myself .
Anyone who challenges the aforementioned common - sense is n't immediately drawn to embrace and believe the less common , but still popular and not scientific , concurrent idea .
The " 10,000-hours rule " is said to have a scientific basis , in spite of the fact that most of its defendants have never read the study that established it .
According to this rule , any person can develop a talent after 10,000 hours of training .
This amount of time does n't fit normal workers ' and students ' tight schedules and busy daily lives , therefore being labeled as impractical and unachievable .
The normal response to this conclusion is , like I and many people who gave up learning a language simply because fluency is out of reach if you do n't have this time available , is the loss of motivation .
Both of them put a heavy burden on parents and on their children .
One asserts that talent is a matter of luck ; the second , of pure time - consuming and presumably expensive dedication .
Like any other unscientific " truth " that circulates and causes harm to our society , this one can only be eliminated through the reading of scientific and specialised publications on the topic , so that the effective ways of becoming talented at something can be adopted , before the popular beliefs take our motivation and self - belief away .
This research project will provide us with a better understanding and insights into this area through the EM trainees ' narratives and experiences of clinical reasoning development in ED and add to the scientific discourse in clinical reasoning .
A narrative approach to exploring and investigating clinical reasoning development can provide a vocabulary that encourages us to integrate insights from different frameworks in ways that combine the strengths of each .
Many people have breakfast in a bar with an espresso or a cappuccino and a croissant .
In the morning , we 're not used to eating salty food like salami , eggs or cheese .
My first night here , I was invited to a dinner mainly for scientists who are up here doing a radio show .
I 'm sat next to Brain Cox and something inside me wilts because I know I am sitting next to a superior being and he will soon find out I 'm a two - celled worm .
I am next to someone who knows what happened to cause the big bang , he sees atoms and electrons and even knows what they are .
He does n't think about things that I , a mere mortal , do , like whether or not there is food on my teeth , and death .
To me , he is greater than any rock star squared .
I am an English teacher here in my country , Spain , and I have worked with children aged 5 - 14 for five years now , in different educational centres .
I am very enthusiastic about being with kids .
I guess that is why I am a bit a of workaholic .
I love playing sports , singing , swimming , doing handicrafts , and cooking as well . I enjoy teamwork , and I always share new ideas and good experiences with my colleagues .
I have a great personality .
I am quite good at organising sports events and games .
I am 20 and currently doing a Barcelona University degree in PE .
I am also a Spanish Red Cross camp leader , as I enjoy all kinds of sports , such as swimming , sailing , kayaking , rock climbing , etc .
I also have a high level of spoken English because for 8 years I have been attending a summer camp in Scotland , where recently I was asked to carry on as an instructor .
I would be suitable for the job advertised because I am extrovert , easy - going , hardworking , thoughtful , and love children and doing outdoor activities such as camping , fishing and cooking . I also enjoy teaching children new skills and helping them to develop their self - confidence .
I would welcome the chance of being part of your company 's team , since it is a world - renowned firm and I am available to travel and change residence .
Because of this , I would be grateful if you could send me information regarding incorporation in the organization ( date , conditions , etc )
That 's because many scientific facts have been revealed .
Furthermore , information about these facts has become much more available .
Furthermore , it 's easy to find out about these valuable discoveries .
There are many more libraries and learning courses available than before .
Also , there are more people who continue their education after graduation from college .
Going to the UK has been a dream of mine , but going to Cornwall , however , might be a bit of an escapade during the winter , considering that I 'm only used to the relatively hot Egyptian weather .
However , I 'm interested in & excited about the journey because it will allow me to have a myriad of new experiences .
Also , I hear people are generally convivial and the countryside is beautiful in Cornwall .
My life has been on a boring plateau for a while now and I have been looking for a change as well as more personal growth .
There is a place in my country which played a very important role during World War II .
As it was full of spruces , it was easy to hide from the German patrols and people from both sides of the border helped Jewish people , spies and English , Canadian or American pilots to flee through Switzerland .
A network developed from the South of France to Switzerland , especially to try to save thousands of Jewish children .
People who participated in that " way to freedom " never asked anything in exchange .
They never spoke about it till a few years ago , as they were considered criminals by their countries as they had broken the law during that time .
But now , they have told the whole world about it , some of them are now considered as heroes in Israel for what they did during those hard times .
Their story has been written and people could finally discover what happened there between the years nineteen thirty - nine and nineteen forty - five .
Last month , a monument was erected in their memory so that nobody forgets what happened in that large forest where - as the people would say in that time - German soldiers could not guard the whole wood , unless they stood behind each spruce ....
Nowadays , public transport is a useful and convenient way of travelling , especially for students , people with a low socioeconomic status , or anyone who wants to go to work or school by bus , train or by subway .
It 's also true that more people have cars than maybe 30 or 40 years ago .
Cars are a good way of saving time , especially when waiting for public transport , mainly buses .
But a disadvantage is that car maintenance and gas is more expensive than paying for public transport .
Airplanes are becoming more and more useful for people who travel for work or even want to get to another place quicker and more safely .
I also think that there will be fewer people using public transport in the future , but some will still be available , because it wo n't be possible for everyone to afford to have a car or travel by plane .
The function of evaluation and assessment must not only be the recognition of the results of the learning process itself , but also how this process took place . Therefore , we will need to use different instruments of assessment .
After the assessment and evaluation we will be able to adapt the necessary pedagogic help to individual students , know up to which point the proposed aims have been achieved , and we will be able to judge the programme planning as a whole .
Assessment and evaluation will provide information , for the teacher as well as for the students .
As far as the students are concerned , they will be able to correct inadequate strategies or behaviour , know the difficulties they encounter in the learning - teaching process and evaluate their own process .
As to the teacher , we will find out whether the programme planning was adequate or not and if s / he was sufficiently involved in the learning - teaching process .
Society is continually changing , ever since we created the first civilizations .
That brings us to the second point : resources .
As the population grows exponentially , the resources fail to do the same .
We have just started worrying about that , but the actions we 're taking are far from enough .
The hard truth is that until someone has to face the situation himself , it 's quite difficult to restrain oneself from wasting energy , food , materials , water ...
But in the near future , most of us will have to deal with it and , therefore , be forced to make dramatic changes in our lives in order to survive .
Finally , and on a more positive note , we 're walking towards a global world .
It 's really good that you 're coming to Uruguay . I would be pleased to help you .
First of all , there are a lot of places to visit here and I would like to take you to Punta del Este , Piriapolis , Cabo Polonio , La paloma and other beautiful places .
You have a lot of hotels to stay at if you want to be there more than a day and the people are really nice . Or if you want , you can stay at my house , of course .
Secondly , you can find a job here in Montevideo or , if you like , in the countryside .
You could work in a public office , for example .
For people who come from other countries like you , there are a lot of internships and I can assure you that you will find a great job . There are also companies that are hiring people to work for a short period of time in their call centers .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you soon !
We will have a great time together here in Uruguay . You will see some of the most popular places in this beautiful country .
The pupils have been taught English since their very first meeting with the English language in school , so they are completely familiar with using English as a classroom language .
The only place where we could imagine a challenge in sticking to English as the classroom language is when the group works together .
The evaluation starts by unfolding the brainstorm from day 1 , and then it continues with the pupils applying all their new words and knowledge about America .
Hereby we want to create consciousness in the pupils ' minds of their new knowledge .
Hereby we both want the pupils to reflect on their learning and bring the teacher valuable information for the next time .
In this class , there are strong wishes for certain areas regarding America that the pupils want to learn : 10 pupils would like to learn about American High School Life , 4 pupils would like to learn about National Parks in America , 4 pupils would like to learn about Native Americans and 1 pupil would like to learn about the American Motor Industry .
Taking the importance of learner autonomy and the importance of the pupils ' motivation into consideration , we have decided that they can follow their interests on this course .
This also gives the pupils the possibility of introducing their classmates to new knowledge - and the communicative situation is authentic .
Kyiv is a good destination for shopaholics .
For those interested in top fashion brands , I would recommend visiting the shops in the main street .
The best manufacturers of clothes , linen , accessories have their shops there . Jewellery and watch shops can also be found nearby .
For those who are looking for cheap but practical clothes , I would recommend you to go to one of the shopping malls of the capital .
Mass - market clothes , bags , cosmetics , children 's toys are available there .
Different shops will offer a wide range of goods and impress with interesting design ideas and unique styles .
The main shopping mall of the city is under reconstruction at the moment , but in one year , it will be open to visitors and will surprise them with high - tech design and exclusive brands .
And if you are trying to find a good product for a reasonable price , visit the city 's outlet centre - collections from the previous years are sold there with significant discounts .
AIESEC has 64 years of experience in turning high - potential young people into globally - minded , responsible leaders .
AIESEC members go through an integrated development experience .
Why do people become homeless ?
One of the reasons is that they are poor because they can not get a job .
I believe we can reduce the number of homeless people in Japan by providing them with information and skills .
For example , if they do not have enough money to have a home and to buy things necessary to live , they can get financial support from the government .
Homeless people tend to be unable to gather information because of lack of means to do it .
The skills include the ability to communicate with people and to overcome hardships .
Then , he got to know that there was a class that provides homeless people with skills for cleaning floors for free .
Little by little , he developed an interest in working .
He got to know how pleasant it is to overcome hard situations .
He also learned how to build a good relationship with people through talking to his colleagues .
To conclude , giving information about support that they can receive from the government and skills is a very helpful way to solve homelessness in Japan .
Some of them think global warming is the most significant problem , whereas others believe deforestation has a greater impact on our world .
This flooding leads to starvation because of lower harvest yields and this creates many refugees .
On the other hand , deforestation is , as said , another part of global warming due to fewer carbon - dioxide - storing trees .
But incinerating a huge part of the rainforest means the destruction of wildlife habitats .
Global warming is a primary cause of starvation but so is deforestation .
Because the roots do not hold the fertile soil , and as a result , it will be blown away by the wind .
To sum up , both issues have enormous impacts on our world .
In both , animals and people are affected .
But , in my opinion , you can stop global warming by stopping deforestation first .
Even though their relationship was of the quarrelling type , everyone around them , friends and family agreed on the fact that the pair were as solid as a rock , and despite the ups and downs , love had always won in the end .
And each time it happened , Cecilia burst into tears , and Michael had to rock his sobbing wife like a baby .
It took him three days to calm down and put things into perspective .
Nowadays , experience is more important than academic knowledge to get a job .
Although experience is extremely important , I disagree that academic qualifications are not important .
Success in a job depends on the amount of theoretical knowledge that a person acquired in an academic institution .
When employees face any problems or difficulties at work , they must refer to the theory that explains this phenomenon . Without knowing this theory , employees ca n't overcome these difficulties . For instance , engineering science seems practical , but each part of engineering science is based on theories .
Therefore , engineers must take demanding knowledge to be successful in a career .
Second of all , theoretical qualifications are crucial for employees , as they help people to think and solve all problems in a fair way .
A scientific approach is more important to deal with problems , beginning with identifying problems and then studying all factors and related information .
Then employees are able to suggest the best solution . This approach is developed in formal education .
Moreover , studying at a university provides an opportunity to interact with a wide range of people and thus build unique communication skills that are very important for employees .
Finally , knowledge could make an open - mined person who has the ability to deal with problems in a fair way .
It is the main part that helps employees to be successful in their careers .
It is certainly true that markets can not abandon formal qualifications in future .
It depends on where and what kind of place you want to reach and it depends on the time of day .
First , what are the advantages of using the bus or train ?
When traveling to city centers , choosing public transport is advised , because parking a car in the city is really expensive and it is very hard to find a space .
When in the center and wanting to enjoy various sights , by car it is hard to get from one place to the other , because the traffic is heavy .
IN that way it will take a lot of your time , while the bus and tramway have their own bus lanes , and hence run smoothly .
In that case , the choice of public transport will be preferable .
When traveling to rural areas , it is quite difficult by public transport , because sometimes there are hardly any trains or buses for the far away places and the tiny villages .
Because not many people go to these places , the schedule will be very tight and the bus will only leave once every hour .
Most of these buses will make many stops , which makes it even more time - consuming .
At the end of the day , you should choose public transport or car according to the purpose of your trip .
The Jirga is a ' traditional system ' of justice , which is actively practiced in , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Baluchistan as well as in districts of Sindh bordering with Baluchistan to resolve legal cases and disputes .
The system , which has been in practice since British rule , was modified under the ' Special Provision Ordinance ( Criminal Provisions 11 ) of 1968 ' .
Besides dispensing justice and dealing with judicial cases , the Jirga also covers all important aspects of the monetary , political , and communal life of tribal society .
However , in its present form , the tribal Jirga , especially in Sindh province , has generated heated debate about its legal position as well as conflict of its rules and codes with the constitution of Pakistan , law of the land or formal justice system as well as international human rights standards and conventions .
The strongest allegation about the Jirga system or ' informal justice system ' has been its unfairness against innocents during the course of decisions and execution of a variety of its rules and regulations .
In fact , the informal justice system is directly proportional to the Jirga that originally has its roots in Baloch culture and has been transferred to Sindhi society progressively .
Naseer Khan was an able general , trained at the court of Ahmad Shah Abdali , the hero of the third battle of the famous Pani Pat . "
In recent years , many nations are developing their own economies rapidly , and it means that many areas of farmland and forests are being cut down to build better and bigger houses and a more convenient transportation system .
First of all , the biggest problem is that the world 's resources are extremely unequal .
For example , Japan is the world 's third largest economy after the United States and China , its economy is so developed , but food , oil , and other resources are all imported , and it puts a lot of heavy industry into developing countries in order to protect its own environment .
Secondly , with the increasing of the earth 's population , the areas of farmland are also decreasing .
People in economically developed areas are in pursuit of the perfect life and the people in undeveloped areas are starving .
So , I think that the government must do something in this respect .
The government should find a balance between economic development and agricultural development .
I think that it will have to develop science and technology such as Yuan Longping 's hybrid rice , or after the food can make people great and then vigorously develop the economy .
As part of the same planet , protecting the global environment is not only the task of the government , but also the task of each of us .
I am in my final year of high school , which I will leave with a university entrance qualification in July of this year .
I have babysat children of different ages for the last 4 years and have found that very satisfying so far .
My babysitting duties were to put the children to bed , provide lunch or dinner , play with them and read to them .
With regard to the tutorials . I have put together my own exercise materials , looked at and discussed class tests and helped the pupils with their homework .
Since I have worked twice as a group instructor at a local summer camp , I think that I am well - equipped to deal with 8 - 12-year - old children from the experience I mentioned .
I hope you will invite me for a job interview , via Skype or in person , and look forward to hearing from you soon .
Suddenly , it got so dark that I could not see a thing .
I started shouting , as my parents were out of sight , but nobody answered .
After a while , I started shaking - I was alone in a forest !
So there was nothing else to do but stay in the same place and wait for someone to help me .
I did not have to wait so long , though - after a while , I saw our car 's lights glowing in the darkness .
Next time I go on such a trip , I need to make sure that I have a fully - charged mobile with me .
I recently completed the four - year bachelor degree in European Studies at Zuyd University in Maastricht .
During my studies , I went abroad to the University of Paris , where I studied political sciences and international management .
After my studies , I did a Master 's in cultural sciences at the University of Maastricht .
I worked in a clothing shop in the past , so I have some sales experience as well .
I have done an internship at the reception in one of the best VIP designer hotels in Sevilla , Spain .
My duties included checking guests in and out , planning and organizing group arrivals , assisting with cash advances , exchanging money , checking guest folios and giving commercial information to customers .
In this way , I have , to some extent , developed strategic thinking about individual client needs .
During my studies , I had to make portfolios several times and had negotiation classes , so that will be no problem for me .
I am a 24-year - old Italian girl . I studied English during high school and for this reason I travelled in different countries in order to improve the language .
In those places , I had the opportunity to communicate with other people from all over the world .
I studied in London for 1 month some years ago and I visited different places , such as Brighton and Liverpool , where I attended some short summer courses .
I would like to improve my communication skills and I would really love to be an active part of your summer camps trying to do new things .
For these reasons , I think I would be a suitable person for this kind of job . I am very open - minded and I love to take care of children because of their beautiful way of thinking and seeing things in a very simple and natural way .
Cooking is one of the things I like most and I am not frightened of working hard , since I believe that if you want to improve , you have to apply yourself a lot .
I hope you will consider my application . This would actually be a wonderful experience for me .
I would be grateful if you could attend to this matter as soon as possible .
I went into his bedroom , and there it was : the letter .
I suddenly knew what had happened , he had taken his own life , and my heart broke .
Since grandpa passed away I have started loving my grandma even more .
That woman knows how to put a smile on a kid 's face .
Granny has straight grey hair , deep blue eyes and a tiny nose .
She also has a pale complexion and black dark circles under eyes .
Grandma 's wrinkled face can be horrifying at night .
She has a really skinny body , and her hands are long and covered in brown spots .
Her tone of voice is so gentle and so calm .
It calms me down and freaks me out at the same time .
My parents told me that grandma is a very sick person .
And she is also watching me with eyes wide open .
Lately I ca n't get enough sleep because of that .
Nana gives me a feeling like I will get killed in my sleep .
It feels just like a horror movie .
It is a creepy feeling .
But I never thought that it could be that serious .
The girls used to hang out together , they spent all their free time together and they were absolutely best friends .
Allison was the girl who kept the group together : all of the girls liked her and she was always the centre of attention .
Suddenly Spencer came to the barn again and told her friends that she had n't seen Allison , but she thought she 'd heard her scream .
All of the messages include the girls ' secrets only Allison knew .
And then , Allison 's body is found .
In the show , the friends try to find out who " A " is and show Allison was murdered , while " A " turns their lives into hell .
On the other hand , lack of privacy is a major disadvantage in a famous person 's life , as their personal life 's boundaries are constantly crossed by paparazzi and journalists .
Besides , the more they succeed , the more their fans expect them to achieve .
In conclusion , fame may be nice , but it 's not an easy path to walk on .
You have money but you do not feel safe . You have friends but you can never be sure if they like you or your money .
I 'm really happy to spend six months in the UK , but it 's really important to plan my days in order to have a good time .
First of all , I would like to work for at least three months in a language school in London as an Italian teacher .
In this way , I 'd have the chance to get to know different people from all over the world and , at the same time , I 'd earn some money to visit the city and the castles of England , where many historic battles were fought .
I was wondering if you would mind asking around if a school is looking for a part - time teacher ?
After leaving London , I 'd love to do two months of volunteering at a children 's hospital in York .
I read in an ad on the internet that young people are asked to entertain sick children and I 'd be really happy to make them smile !
Will you help me to write a striking CV ?
My stay is going to conclude with a trip I 've always dreamed of : Cornwall .
I 'm meeting two friends of mine in Bristol where we 're renting a little car and we 're going to travel without a destination !
Thank you for your advice . Kisses !
It had been a hot summer 's day .
Michel 's parents were out so it was the perfect excuse to have an amazing party in the living room , even though they forbade him meeting with friends .
When night fell and all the guests had arrived , Michael started to lose control of the situation .
Suddenly , a deafening noise coming from the dining room stopped the party , but nobody knew what had happened .
Almost immediately , the house was empty , and the music turned off , letting Michael realise that his grandmother 's vase , valued at £ 2000 was broken .
Michael decided to blame the dog for the unfortunate incident and when he told his father what had happened , he automatically put the dog up for adoption as it was n't the first time , despite Michael 's attempts to avoid him doing it .
Once they had arrived at the shelter , the family started to say goodbye to the dog , crying loudly .
Having lived in four different cities ( Brighton , London , Manchester and Cambridge ) in the UK , I have become more adaptable to new environments and keen to accept new challenges .
Given my strong academic background and my leadership experiences at university , including the completion of the Manchester Leadership Programme , I believe I am a strong candidate for this position . I enclose a copy of my CV and hope very much to be invited for interview .
She had dreamed of living there since she was a little girl , but she also realized that she would leave all the people that she cared about .
At this point , no one knew that she had had the interview and the interviewer told her that the job was hers .
Not even her boyfriend knew about this , and she felt ashamed because , deep inside her , she knew that he would feel betrayed and he probably would n't want to be with her anymore .
But if she did n't take this job , she would regret it her whole life , and living with that was something she was not willing to do .
She thought that she could have done things differently , but it was too late to change them .
I am a very energetic , hardworking , caring , tolerant , fun - to - be - with 30-year - old woman who loves spending time with children .
Furthermore , as a former scout , I have the necessary skills for organizing different sports games and I am familiar with a wide range of evening activities .
In addition , as a mother of 8-and-12-year - old boys , I have a vast knowledge of children 's psychology and am an excellent cook .
Besides , while being an exchange student in the USA during my school years , I improved my English speaking and communication skills .
Regarding the living arrangements , as I understand it , food and accommodation are provided by the summer camp .
And I am confident that I would be a useful member of your summer camp team .
Looking forward to your reply . Please feel free to ask me any questions .
But then , every once in a while , one can also hear stories of brothers fighting over the inheritance , or a parent not speaking to their child for making a wrong life decision .
The members of your family indeed are your best friends , but only if you do n't take them for granted , if you respect them and their space and opinion .
I was asked last week to write a report about the best places for young people in my area .
These are my findings and my recommendations .
It was renovated last year and regulars like it a lot .
Kids have to pay 10 euros just for entrance before getting anything else .
- There is another place where local youths spend a lot of hours ; the new and magnificent mall .
It has 150 stores and about 40 fast - food restaurants .
They especially like the music store and the magnificent t - shirt store owned by two local designers . There you can design your own item and collect it the following week .
My name is Susanne White and I would like to apply for the position as a camp assistant advertised in the Crash Magazine .
I will be on vacation from July to September and I would be glad to work with children again .
Apart from my experience in the Arts , I also have been doing gymnastics for ten years ; therefore , I am a sporty girl .
An individual must be aware of the result of his actions on the environment , be it due to personal or professional actions , in order to maintain it in a healthy state .
In Clayton , my hometown , people are fond of maintaining the environment and they actively participate in encouraging people who try to work towards its progress as well as in protesting against those who tend to cause harm to it .
The municipal board of Clayton conducts meetings fortnightly to inform people about the improvements that have been made and that have been planned to be implemented in future in the town .
Earlier , regardless of whether the rubbish was recyclable or not , it was disposed of in the same bin .
Later , people were educated regarding recyclable , non - recyclable and organic waste and were also informed that the rubbish was to be disposed of in different bins .
Hence , the municipal board decided to invite the developers to the meeting that was scheduled for a weeks ' time .
In the meeting , it was decided that on the following Sunday everyone would plant a tree that would be provided by the municipal board for free .
On the following Sunday , as discussed , trees were planted and before we realized it , they started adding beauty to our town .
Taking care of the environment is everyone 's duty and it must be done responsibly .
The municipal board of Clayton does an excellent job of educating its people to keep the environment in a healthy state .
I hope people will take them as an example and introduce similar ideas in their own towns or villages .
One day Michael woke up from a strange dream , the dream was focused on a camera that was following a shadow in front of it .
Everything was dark except for a ray of light that probably started at the end of that .
The shadow kept walking and running from what Michael supposed was a threat .
Michael was confused , he did n't know why he had dreamed that . He thought it would be better to forget about it , so he stopped thinking about his dream .
That day Michael had to go to work , so he got up from his bed and went to his bathroom .
When he was ready , he took his keys and everything he needed , he locked the door and went to his job .
When he arrived at the building where he worked , he took the elevator and went to his floor .
Since he had entered the building he had had a strange feeling . When he arrived at his office , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Further to our phone conversation of last week , I would first like to thank you for giving me this chance to talk to you , and following up on our discussion , please note that we have been approached by the purchasing department at the hospital to give them our maximum discount to secure the deal as a lot of brokers were quoting with a very competitive price which was very close to our cost .
In light of the above , and as agreed , I seek your kind help in approving the price of $ 30.00 each to close this deal in a safe way .
After an hour Mindy was holding her baby- girl and Peter was trying to realize what had just happened .
" Never would I have thought that I 'd go out of my house and come back as almost a midwife ... " thought Peter when he was driving back home .
Computers have become an essential part of our lives in the last few decades .
They have replaced many things , like books .
However , they have stopped us from doing many fun things as well . What are those things ? Do we really need computers ? Are they really helping us ?
They were invented to help us calculate things in the first place , anyway .
But we , ordinary people , do n't use computers to solve equations , we use them to type things , print things , design things , make games and to do much more ...
We have made programs that make computers do very interesting things , like graphics .
Furthermore , the major thing that computers made easier for us is communication .
Humans are social animals , we communicate because communication is in our genes . If we do n't communicate we go insane .
So computers help us do that . They help us share our thoughts and feelings with other people easily .
On the other hand , computers have very bad effects on both us , and the environment .
Also , looking at a screen is tiring for your eyes and if your eyes get too tired they can get damaged forever .
Computers have made our lives easier without doubt , so it is normal that they have some bad effects .
There is a saying in Turkish saying ' If you love a rose , you have to withstand its thorns ' .
In my opinion , computers might be the best invention ever made , since they 've become an essential part of our daily lives and since we rely on them so much .
Lucila Marcelo and I met at secondary school and we have been friends for seven years .
We have also worked together at a kindergarten for some time and this year we started our studies at an institute in order to become primary teachers .
Lucila has proved herself to be an extremely sincere and reliable person since I met her .
As a student , she is persistent and hardworking as well as respected by teachers and students because of her warmth and kindness .
Lucila is the eldest of six siblings , so she is used to babysitting children .
When we worked at the kindergarten , she was very patient and caring with the children and she was also willing to help them whenever they had a problem , even if that implied hard work for her .
I can confirm that she had a special connection with the kids : she was admired by those who had a great time with her .
She would undoubtedly do an excellent job and , for the reasons I have given , I have no hesitation in supporting her application .
That is actually a mistake , because the schools who best prepare students for working life are technical institutes , who emphasize the real - world applications of the studied subjects through laboratories and industry experiences .
Conversely , grammar schools focus extremely on theory .
What I would suggest in order to deal with this problem is to integrate more laboratory experiences in grammar schools also , like chemistry experiments or bacteria observation with microscopes .
I am a native Spanish speaker who has a very good level of English and I have also spent 5 years living in the United Kingdom .
I am used to organising sporting events and fun activities for children and teenagers aged 6 - 19 .
In addition , I have experience working in restaurants during the summer , so I am used to all types of kitchen duties including cooking and washing up .
Nobody can argue with the fact that education is a crucial period in the development of a child .
Learning new languages is very important , but also studying subjects related to computers and technology , like computer programming , is becoming more and more useful than ancient languages like Greek or Latin .
This is because technology has become a relevant tool for work and study , in particular , and an important tool in life in general .
On the one hand , it allows students to understand and translate ancient texts and helps them to learn about cultures from the past .
On the other hand , this does not bring very many employment opportunities .
Recent surveys proved that the study of these languages does not add much to the students ' future success .
Learning computer programming , guarantees a good living .
Furthermore , as technology changes more and more , there will be a greater demand for these skills in the future .
It is evident that technology is important in every aspect of our lives .
In conclusion , there are a lot of subjects that might be taught at school , but there is no doubt that Computer Programming should be included as a highlighted subject in the syllabus of any serious school 's programme .
I have considered them my favorite band since 2010 , because I had the chance to get to meet them watching The X Factor episode where they auditioned .
When they released their second album , I was so excited about it and I waited like 2 hours in the line at a music shop to get it . Years passed by , and I was still a fan of them , as I am now .
It includes twelve tracks to enjoy that you wait impatiently for the next song .
That fascinating album surprises not only with the variety of subjects , but also with the strength of the instrumental sounds .
It is bound to be at the top of my list . '
False alarm ' , which is the second track , is totally different and mysterious because of the wealth of musical instruments .
Groban sings the well - known from the film ' Once " song called ' Falling slowly ' in his own fantastic way , but listeners used to the first version might be disappointed .
Musically satisfying , ' Happy in my heartache ' , tells the story of tragic love .
I definitely recommend that album for your collection .
Besides , he also came to be keen on learning foreign languages , so much so that he decided to enroll in courses in French and German .
When the exam was finished , he went out of the room where the competition had been held .
The reason I am writing to you is the poor quality of a food processor which I bought in your store two weeks ago .
After using it two times , problems started to appear .
I noticed that the first malfunction was the safety lock , which demanded applying great force .
We discovered another problem when we tried to use the blender .
It started working , but suddenly got stuck and we have been unable to use it since .
I was very surprised to discover that many problems in quite an expensive model .
After two weeks , the food processor had still not arrived .
As a solution , he offered to upgrade my model to a better one and this , too , would take two weeks .
I am very disappointed with both the equipment and the service I have received .
Therefore , I expect a refund of the full amount , $ 180 , as soon as possible .
Not only do I have a big nuclear family which is made up of four siblings , but I also have a big extended family .
Besides , as I am the eldest brother , I am used to dealing with children .
Regarding my experience , on the one hand , I belong to a soccer club at university . Consequently , I have some experience working in a team .
On the other hand , I have just finished my first year of a Physical Education degree , where we played a lot of different sports .
It is true that water sports are not the most usual there , but , I enjoy doing them every summer at the beach .
I feel I am the person you are looking for because I am patient and alert .
These are the most important skills when you deal with children , due to the fact that you need to keep on the lookout for their behaviour .
Moreover , from my point of view , children need to focus their attention on constant activity . My sense of humour and creativity allow me to change activities quickly in order to keep their attention .
If you offer me the chance to join your team , you will not be disappointed .
These days , travelling by car is becoming more popular among urban people .
This kind of transport is regarded as a convenient way to travel .
Governments build more roads and more families are able to afford cars .
However , I disagree with this idea .
Instead , I think that public transport will play an essential part in future life .
There are three advantages of public transport over private cars that I want to describe .
On the one hand , it is environmentally friendly to use public transport rather than cars .
Nowadays , buses using electronic power instead of petrol have appeared in cities .
They emit no gas into the air , leading to little air pollution .
In the meantime , if people prefer to take buses or subways , there will be less noise in the streets .
On the other hand , buses and subways can accommodate more passengers , while a car can only hold 4 to 5 people in total .
Compared with cars , public transport has a larger capacity , which saves space and costs less .
Last but not least , fewer car accidents will happen if people choose to use public transport , so traffic jams will be avoided especially in rush hours .
In conclusion , public transport is a cost - effective way for people to travel which also contributes to the sustainable development of society .
The statement claims that the educational institutions are responsible for convincing students not to put too much effort into fields or subjects that they are not good at , which I can not agree with .
This statement fails to consider the main function of education , which is not training superstars or perfect robots but teaching students how to face and solve the problems they are confronted with instead of running away .
The responsibility of educational institutions should be helping and guiding students to make their own decisions , not making decisions for students .
Among the various purposes of education , in my opinion , the most important one is teaching students to solve problems .
Confronting the challenging instead of turning aside , trying to think of possible solutions instead of giving up at the beginning , always being positive about the unknown instead of negative and retreating . All these are the main reasons why humankind can keep improving .
Transferring this knowledge and experience to young people is the meaning of education .
If the educational institutions always stopped students from trying just because they have less chance of being successful , we 'll never have people like Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein , who were considered as stupid kids in school but did n't give up trying .
One may suggest that everyone needs to learn to assess the risk before investing , however , teaching students how to assess , not assessing for students , is the responsibility of educational institutions .
Truly , knowing one 's limit is the first step to bringing out the maximum value of one 's talent .
It 's not smart to encourage people to do what exceeds their ability .
Nevertheless , the ability to identify one 's limits can be best learned from experience .
The responsibility of educational institutions is to make sure that he / she wo n't be in danger in the swimming pool instead of dissuading him / her from getting close to the water .
Educational institutions should guide students to have better self - understanding and self - assessment , not persuade them to follow a pre - decided path .
What if a student would rather to do something he / she likes instead of something he / she is good at ?
Not everyone is living for the kind of success which most people agree with , such as wealth , fame or power .
For some people , living a life which enables them do what they like and like what they are doing is enough to be considered as a successful life .
They might not be the best , but they are self - actualized and satisfied , and only in such a situation can they provide most to the world , just like Albert Einstein said , " Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value . "
Considering all the above , I can not agree with the statement that persuading students not to pursue fields of study in which they have less possibility to be successful is the responsibility of educational institutions .
In my opinion , the purpose of education is to teach and guide students how to face problems and make their own decisions properly , not force them to accept what has already been arranged for them .
The most popular TV programme in Germany is definitely the news programme " Tagesschau " , which airs about three times a day on the channel " Das Erste / ARD " .
It is a news programme based on well - researched facts and offers a wide range of all the important information you need .
Every now and then , they even air an extra report on a certain field , like the European election or the crisis in the Ukraine .
The main reason for its popularity is its accuracy and funded research , which make it more reliable than other news programmes .
Moreover , they try to be interesting to all ages , so they post on Facebook and Twitter as well , which draws the attention of the younger generation to the programme .
Nevertheless , they always inform about the latest news on their website and in their TV show as soon as possible and , in addition , they give a great overview of the necessary background information you need .
I strongly believe that this TV programme deserves its popularity .
The way they present themselves in the media and the well - founded research are truly unique in German news programmes .
Although I rarely watch the show on TV , I like the way they are trying to keep up with modern technology and that they are always making boring news so vivid and interesting through short video clips , pictures and their choice of words .
If you ever get to watch TV in Germany , you should definitely check out this interesting news programme .
Do you get along with your boss ?
Last summer , I finally managed to change my boring job and that tiny clothes job for a better one .
We 'd get there at about half past eight every day and start cleaning the main room proceeding with the smaller rooms in the cinema .
It was a lot of fun , mainly because it was just us two .
We 'd make jokes and chase each other with brooms , trying to smack each other on the head .
The main advantage of working at the local cinema was the free popcorn and getting to enjoy the latest films .
My job was cleaning the cinema , but Fred 's main responsibility was to play the movies for the clients , so I 'd make sure I finished cleaning earlier , so I could enjoy watching the movies with him .
For the last ten years , Michael had been working for a well - known company in London as an accountant .
He did like his job but , as we all know , sometimes people suddenly feel they have to change something .
One day , he woke up much earlier than usual .
He made a coffee for himself and turned the TV on to watch the news .
He sat on the sofa in front of the television and , suddenly , he realised that every morning was exactly the same , nothing had changed for so many years ! "
I ca n't stand it any longer " - he thought .
Since Michael was a child he had always dreamt of moving to Australia , where he could go kitesurfing all day long , meet open - minded people , chill on a sandy beach and drink good Australian alcohol .
At that moment , he was pretty sure what to do now .
After 10 minutes , a resignation letter was ready to take to Michael 's boss .
He arrived at the company as quickly as the crowded London streets allowed him .
" I need to talk to the boss " - he said to Jane , the main secretary of the company .
Without waiting for her answer , he just went into the office , gave Mike , his boss for 10 years , an envelope with the resignation letter and left .
Sometimes we do things we do n't want to for no apparent reason but some other times we know exactly what we are getting into .
There was no way to shine a different light on that fact .
He could not keep his betrayal inside any longer , so he went into the living room and told her .
The words coming out of his mouth like a litany , almost mechanically , as he realized that there was no turning back .
The relief of telling her was instantly replaced by a bitter hollowness .
He did n't do it for her , he only did it for himself , to get rid of his burden , but it was far too late .
Glitz , glamour and popularity ; three words which are often linked to the world of football , and this sport is no doubt one of the finest that man has created .
The 90 minutes is the most enjoyed time of the week though , because of the adrenalin rush that is associated with everything that is done on the pitch .
As a fan , supporting a team is just one part of the sport .
Rivalries , arguments about which team is the best team and watching matches in a group just add to the excitement .
With regard to this sport , any advice , in my opinion , is good advice and I have just a single piece of advice for someone starting this sport , and that advice would be to enjoy everything related to the sport .
Nowadays students need to learn both language and mathematics until they go to university , even some of them still need to study them at university .
A large number of examples prove that some of them are good at language whereas others are skilled at mathematics .
This essay will discuss the differences and similarities between learning a language and learning mathematics .
For studying a language , people need to communicate with others to improve their speaking and listening levels and read a variety of foreign - language books to increase their reading and writing skills .
In general , studying a language focuses more on a large amount of individual effort and little talent .
However , for learning mathematics , students need to listen carefully in the class and find some rules to solve questions . Instead of rote learning , they should remember different types of formulas by practicing a mass of examples .
However , there are some similarities between those two subjects .
Firstly , both those courses need to do a mass of practices , even though the methods are different .
People need to spend a huge amount of time on doing exercises after class .
For example , when people learn a new word or a formula , they need to think about how to use it in real sentences or exercises .
In conclusion , people need to find the right way which can save a lot of time and energy to study these two subjects .
It is the most important thing that they should think about carefully before they start their studies .
However , when I was young I soon discovered that some dimensions of difference do carry social significance .
A feminine gay man is considered as less than his masculine counterpart , because femininity is regarded as weak , unattractive , and second - class .
She chose a cosy little restaurant near her house .
She did not suspect that it would be such a wonderful evening .
As soon as Anna and her friends went into the restaurant , everything started to go perfectly .
They had all got special clothes and dressed up in colourful , old - fashioned dresses .
She said to her friends : ' This is the best party ever !
She started to dance with an Elvis look - alike , laugh and enjoy every single minute .
As it turned out later , to Anna 's surprise , it was her boyfriend dressed as Elvis .
But immediately she realized that it was one of her friends ' tricky plans and she started to laugh with them .
After a few exciting hours of the party she said thank you to her friends and boyfriend and promised she would never forget what they had done for her .
She went to sleep with the belief that she was the happiest girl in the world .
Its historical importance lies in the fact that this place represents the fall of the Muslim kingdom in my country .
The Catholic Monarchs , Isabella and Ferdinad , had tried for several years to defeat the Muslims , who at that time , only remained seated in the city of Granada .
Its surroundings are also wonderful , and the city invites you to spend more time in the Alhambra , one of the last Muslim palaces in the world .
I haven't seen you for almost two months but , as you know , in November I had a unique opportunity to help at a concert that took place on an airport runway and it was a simply amazing experience !
I 'm sure you know that I 'm obsessed with rock music and that is why I could n't miss the boat .
The event started at 7 p.m. but all the volunteers who had signed a contract had to work from 8 a.m. Everything has to be perfect during such events , so we had no time to relax or even eat a decent meal !
People looked like aggressive monsters and I realised that they are close to killing their every single ' rival ' .
Security guards had a lot of work to do but , thanks to them , we stood a chance of dealing with other problems , such as , for example , regulating the quality of the sound .
The band was playing , we were enjoying the music and it seemed that there would be no more complications .
What you actually think at such an extraordinary moment is that life could n't be more beautiful .
just a quick answer your request .
So , the deal is , I met this guy , Ron , in the bar and we started talking .
After a few drinks , I told him that I 'm currently looking for a job , nothing big , just a couple of hours during weekends to make some money for my journey to the Netherlands .
It 's literally 10 - 15 hours on Friday nights and Saturdays , stuff like carrying instruments ( which means hanging out with musicians ) , tidying after ( finding things , like wallets and cellphones ) and , generally speaking , - helping .
Last week I worked most the of time with the manager of The Kooks .
In fact , I had to be everywhere with the guy , just hanging and helping him not to get lost in the city .
He 's a really nice guy . During the concert we had a few drinks , smoked some fags together .
Usually I get 12 PLN per hour ( yeah , I know , It 's like 2.50 pounds , but here it 's quite good ) but sometimes I get some extra money for staying after hours or when I do something unusual to help .
Last time , it was , for example , delivering my drunk boss home ;)
Take care and call me on Skype tomorrow - I 'll tell you so much more . I have loads of unbelievable stories !
I 'm a chemist , I ca n't kill people because I want to .
The police were going to come at any time .
He grabbed the body and put it in the car 's trunk .
His partner said : " Man , we have to do something and quick " .
They grabbed the body and soaked it in fuel .
Later , when they were sure that there was no one near , they burned the car .
The killer 's partner felt guilty for a moment , but then the killer told him : ' He deserved it .
Sadly , the police found out that it was them .
Thanks to the fact that the judge 's best friend had been killed by the man the chemist killed , they went free and without bad feeling .
The enthusiastic and clever Elizabeth stands out among them , striving to put everything in a broader perspective .
However , their whole lives will be turned upside down when an eligible bachelor and his friends set up home in a nearby mansion .
In the end , will each one be able to overcome their own pride and prejudice ?
Therefore , dialogues , settings as well as politeness , costumes and hairstyles are meant to give it greater public appeal , sacrificing historical accuracy .
Thus , overlapping dialogues are introduced in a mixture of modern idiom and archaic sentence structure , several scenes have been shifted to more romantic settings , and the proximity of the Bennets to their rural life is stressed to illustrate their relative poverty in contrast with the rich characters of the story .
I am a 45-year - old man and I have plenty of experience of working with people .
I used to work with young people in primary and secondary schools , teaching Spanish language .
Although I still have not passed the FCE exam , I am currently working hard to achieve that goal very soon .
Above all , I am interested in films .
Science fiction are my favourite type of films because I like to leave behind normal life . Nevertheless , I enjoy all kinds of films such as comedies , thrillers , westerns , horror films and even silent films .
I think I am right for the position because I think I can boost the motivation of people about movies and push them to share their particular point of view .
As far as the job is concerned , working on Monday and Wednesday evening would be perfect for me because I am currently unemployed .
Our club members are thrilled to know that an international sports star like you is coming to see them .
In reference to the speech date , the best would be June 12 , in the evening , when all the members will have finished their classes at school .
What about talking about fair play in sport and how to become a sports star ?
We believe that fair play is a very important topic , because children must learn to behave properly when playing a sport .
Also , we think that becoming a sports star is difficult and it would be a good idea to talk about it , because some of the club members wrongly think it is easy to succeed at playing a sport .
Some of these thoughts make us smile , some make us frown .
I have written many poems , a few articles and even a few stories .
It is certainly a pleasure to write and also to read what I have written , after a long time .
Many times , reading my own poems and articles is a surprising experience . "
" I ask myself , wondering how I came up with some ideas and words that seem just so good and uncommon right now .
Other than myself , I have had few people read what I have written ; very few , I must say ; maybe only 2 or 3 ; and they were not critics or experts .
So , I have yet to submit myself to some serious criticism ( well , calling my writings literature is a huge joke in itself ... anyway ) ; but yes , I would like to place my written works ( however small and few they may be)for qualitative discussion in front of people who really can identify the good and the ' not - so - good ' writing .
I would like to get good advice about how I can make myself a better writer .
Do we know what it means to be a friend ?
Firstly , we ought to consider that friendship is not uniquely a human emotion .
Friendship is overall an act of will .
Friendship is a type of love which is characterized by being unconditional , reciprocal , and ready to forgive each other .
A friend is a treasure , as in the title of that adventure - comedy film , somebody you can share your problems with .
Somebody who listens to you talking about your dreams and wishes , your expectations and your efforts and sacrifices to get them , your plans for the future , and moreover , pays special attention in times of crisis .
Finally , they warn me of danger but they let me do something , even if in the end I make a big mistake . They will always keep close to me and none of them would fail me .
They feel happy when I am happy , they are sad when I am sad , they enjoy my success .
Many believe that the portrait is that of DaVinci himself , while many also see a lot mystical connections in this painting .
The portrait depicts a woman 's head and shoulders , with a distant landscape that is visible in the backdrop .
Leonardo used a pyramid design to situate the woman in a simple and calm manner within the painting .
The light is diffused so that the various curves and geometrical shapes in the painting are made visible through it .
Some winding paths and a faraway bridge is also perceptible in the background .
Without the intervention of the government , criminals may see their chances to take advantage of internet users .
However , if the government were to monitor the citizens ' actions more closely , it would be considered an invasion of our privacy .
Nobody wants to have their private data exposed to the eyes of the government .
That way , most of the trouble would be kept away from the internet while , at the same time , the internet users would still have the freedom to explore the web .
Family characteristics such as eye and hair colour are inherited by children from their parents as are some diseases and mental disorders .
This provides evidence that life experiences and the surroundings where you grow up have defined the kind of person you are today .
Regarding personal skills , there are a large number of cases in which children were born gifted for the same field as their parents having great potential for a specific art or science from early childhood .
According to this fact , parents often shape their children 's lives by encouraging them to follow in their footsteps .
Likewise , some people put their success in life more down to their parents ' training than to their innate talents .
So , to conclude , we would have to argue that both nature and nurture make us who we are .
The problem is how to separate these two influences and how to find out which is the strongest in each case .
Your new friends seem to be crazy guys . In a good way , of course .
As I 've got some extra money at last , I think It 's high time for me to think about how to make it cozy and comfortable .
First , I am thinking about painting the walls in warm colors ( apricot , salmon pink or warm beige ) . I thought you might add some more interesting colors to the list .
Do you think a wall mural is a good decision for the bedroom and what other " special effects " would you recommend ?
I completely rely on your taste , as we 've always been on the same wavelength .
Now , the toughest questions . I 've got no idea what to do with the ceiling .
I hope I 'm not bothering you too much with my redecoration , knowing how busy you are .
CONVENIENCE IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
We do that for work or to finally have a rest .
I , as a young woman , usually travel just as a hobby .
Since technology has improved in recent years , we now have a huge variety of different ways to travel .
The most common answer would probably be the plane .
Travelling on a boat is a great adventure for sure .
In my country , trains are n't really fast and there could be problems during the trip , but that , for me , makes it more interesting .
During the trip you can do many things - from sleeping to meeting new people and having fun .
It is also quite safe , so you do n't have to worry about accidents .
A trip is an adventure and the ways you can travel are a big part of it .
Back in 2010 , I traveled from Porto Alegre to Sao Paulo by car , a journey that took 18 hours driving non - stop . Surely very few people would consider it convenient ?
Cars are handy and driving can be pleasant , but only when the driver is in a good mood , with no traffic jams or craters on the road ( really common situations in Brazil ) .
Since ancient times , public transport has existed , and it suffered numerous assassination attempts . In China , for example , the dynasty Yuan prohibited public transport ( at that time , chariots ) because of fear that Han people could plot and riot against the Mongol 's dictatorship on it ; the situation was reversed in an early socialist regime when , in 1960 , Mao considered personal cars an instrument of oppression and symbol of devilish capitalism .
We have cars so we do n't have to walk . In the same way , people who ca n't afford a car will want public transport , even if a bike could be the solution .
Convenience has little to do with the fate of public transport . Countries with high HDI ( convenience to be drivers ) , like Germany and England , are those with better public transport systems , and they are even boosting them .
Unless some extraordinary mutation happens and changes us into labor - lovers , personal cars and public transport will rule side by side for all eternity .
Hi ! My name is Alexia , I am twenty - three years old and I live in Argentina .
I have been learning English for a while , I am a sensitive and positive person , full of energy and willing to have new adventures .
I have experience of taking care of children and it is a task that I really enjoy .
What I like the most about being with young children is the energy that they have and how innocent and peaceful they can be .
I think I might be a suitable person for the job because I have already worked with kids , especially teaching and having fun .
As I have already said , I play sports , and that is why I could be helpful at organizing sports and evening activities .
And last but no least , I am an excellent cook .
I learned how to cook when I was eight , so I am pretty confident and well prepared .
Actually , my family is huge so I can cook large amounts of food with my own recipes which are tasty and quick in order to feed all the kids in a trice .
If you hire me you wo n't regret it .
The process can be divided into three stages .
Then comes the preparation of metal plates and that needs skilled machinists .
Only after all the work above is completed can the printing step be carried out .
In addition , the images can be slightly raised .
After printing , there is a lot more work to be done .
The most important step is manual inspection .
After that , good quality sheets and bank notes are separated from partially damaged sheets and will be packaged and distributed .
Bad sheets and bank notes will be securely destroyed .
These are near to France and Andorra .
There are lots of ski resorts with good ski slopes of different levels with different colours , the greens are the easiest and blacks are the most difficult .
When there is n't any race , you can go and try different racing cars or if you want you can go and race a bike on the race track .
To sum up , I think that if you want to do exciting sports , Catalonia is a good place where you can find lots of different sports and you can choose what to do , but if you do n't want to do sports you can do other activities or go to interesting places .
Michael tried the cream and thought that his mother would n't notice it if he ate another bit . '
That night , the time flew by , but things started to get weird . Marcus was talking with an Australian guy about the proofs that he had found related to dinosaurs . He was interested in them , but Marcus did n't like his point of view about those species . The guy told him they were bad creatures with no feelings , and Marcus thought they were awesome and the most lovely creatures he had ever heard about . The guy thought Marcus was crazy , so he fled the Federal Palace .
Meanwhile , Mark and Michael were talking with Russian ladies . They were beautiful and flawless . The scientists started talking about science and that sort of thing , and suddenly the ladies vanished . The men started shouting .
Jack was arguing with an officer about the Mexico conquest ( the officer did n't understand anything because Jack was drunk ) , and suddenly , the officer took off his costume and a strange mask , and at that moment … Jack was astonished because the officer was not an officer , he was Brad !
Jack tried to confront him , but as soon as he tried to do that , he snapped his fingers and a lot of people came around him . He had a new team . He decided to name them " The KM-3J " , a villains team , their names were Karolina ( she decided to change her name to that because he used to say that that letter was her favorite one ) , Melanie , Miley ( they were both twins , the most beautiful ladies in the world ) , Max , who was an expert in the military field , and Brad Rowley J. , nobody had known his last name until that moment : Junior . He was embarrassed about it , he was the offspring of a weird woman , but she was his mother .
The KM-3J put Jack into an immense bag . They were planning to kill him and place his dead body in a grave . In that way , their friends would find him buried . But they were not that evil , they just put him into a dark room and tied his hands to a chair . It was exactly the same thing he had dreamed about .
While Jack was there , he heard Brad talking with Max about their new plan . It was related to a gigantic weapon that would shoot toxic waste at New York City , so in that way , everybody would become a zombie .
The bulk of the population of New York was homeless because there had just been a horrible war between New York City and California , but , increasingly refined body technologies allowed New York to win the war .
Jack was frightened , but suddenly he heard the door opening and saw their friends rescuing him . They had used some weapons from The King of the Sky . They got into the room and started shooting while Michael was untying Jack from the chair . Accidentally , Mark killed Miley while he was shooting . All her body parts were scattered on the floor . He did n't care about that and fled with the others .
When they arrived at the mainland , Jack woke up . There was n't anyone around him , there was just sand and the beach …
Hence , it is not possible to do a job and study side by side .
Work and education disturb one another .
I will elaborate on points to support my opinion in the following paragraphs .
Firstly , there are a lot of people in western countries , who do part - time study and work full - time or vice - versa .
This not only makes them knowledgeable but increases their potential as well .
Secondly , there are a few parents who can not bear the expense of their child 's education .
As a result , they put their children into some job so that they can earn money for the family .
But it does not mean that the child has to abandon his dream of acquiring an education .
Finally , sometimes people think they have completed their education , but when they get a full - time job , they realize that a diploma or degree can increase their chances of promotion .
I write to you to express my interest in applying for the weekend worker job that was posted on your cafe door .
I believe I am a good fit for this job since I have previous experience working in similar jobs .
I demonstrated a courteous and professional attitude and achieved a high rating in the customer satisfaction survey .
Moreover , I have training in the field of customer service since I finished a customer service training course at George White College .
I am also a quick learner and adapt well to different working environments .
Duped , so to speak , into this unlikely event ; a date night .
Was it at the party which lasted until 3 am the night before ?
Was it the invitation to a wedding three weeks ago ?
How far back could it possibly go ?
So many twists and turns . She played her cards well . I never suspected , while sitting in the pews next to my wife , that , when she leaned forward with a pained expression on her face , the evening would end at D'el Arte .
Nor when her condition appeared to worsen and I decided to go get the car to take her to the doctor 's surgery . Nor when I returned to find her lying on the cold hard stone floor of the church , could I have ever imagined we would be enjoying a quiet evening together sharing entrees and desserts .
Nor could I have conceived , after having multiple people help call the ambulance , which never came , or the friends who called my in - laws to come take care of the kids , that we would be eating a wonderful pizza by the end of the evening .
No , none of these things would have prepared me for the relief I would feel , after waiting 4 hours in the emergency room , that her pains were probably only intercostal muscle pains and the tests for something more serious were all negative .
I 'm writing as in response to an advertisement for a job in the USA .
I think I would be suitable for this job , because I am young , energetic , enthusiastic and have always enjoyed working with children .
I can speak English , since I used to vacation in Australia as a child .
I grew up with two younger brothers and used to look after them . Therefore , I am used to dealing with younger kids .
In my opinion , this job would be a great , useful experience .
I 'm Antonio Trevisano del Bruno , a 15-year - old Italian teenager , and I have studied English since I was 7 .
I am a really sporty person and I think I might be the person who you are looking for because I 'm really capable and patient with children .
So , I do n't find it difficult to organize competitions or activities for children .
I 'm a really cheerful person and , though I am 15 , I keep up with the kids ' world .
Yours faithfully
My goal , I decided then , was to become a pilot when I grew up .
Suddenly , my plane began to act up . I was losing control .
I looked at the plane and realized I had forgotten to tie the parachute cord to the plane .
Thank God I had n't jumped or I would have been a ' dead duck ' for sure !
My mom has a kindergarten and I love helping her out .
Every summer I help on my mom 's summer camp , but it 's a summer camp for babies and I would like to work with older children , because I think it 's more challenging . I would love to work at any place across the US .
I am very good at artistic things , such as , drawing , painting , cooking , dancing and a lot of other things .
I hope to get this job because I have been wanting it for a very long time .
I would be very happy to get it .
Last month , as you may know , I was a volunteer on the occasion of my favourite band 's concert in Katowice .
It was just a miracle - it had turned out that the band 's manager was my good old friend , Daniel , and he asked me for help when he found out I was a big fan of the group .
Firstly , I had to be involved in it a month before the event started .
I was asked to give some information about the concert to local pubs , restaurants etc . ,
so I was handing out leaflets everywhere .
By the time the event was due to take place , I had to take over the band 's equipment .
I had to move it from place to place along with the boys from the group .
One thing led to another and we ended up having a beer and laughing in a pub .
If you ever have an opportunity to help at this kind of event , I recommend it to you from the bottom of my heart !
I 'm very happy to hear from you since we have both been quite busy these days with the exams .
You have always wanted to be a policewoman ( unless you have recently changed your mind ) so you must be very fit , since you need to pass the physical tests , which are very demanding , according to my mother .
Sport is something essential to achieving this goal and you can always practise music at home when you have some free time ( yes , I know that it happens once in a blue moon ) .
Also , you wrote to me that you have started to give guitar lessons , so you are not going to be isolated from music and it will go on playing an important role in your life .
So I think you should n't be upset because now is a difficult period , I know , but it passes and we can get back our lives when we go to university .
My cousin , who is studying English Literature , told me that you have much more freedom when you start university , so do n't worry !
I hope you write to me when you have made the final decision . I look forward to hearing from you .
He can remember his name , Thomas , but that 's all he can remember : everything important has been wiped clean .
Language itself also becomes vitally important : the boy s ' speech is peppered with made - up words that highlight the isolation .
The book ends with a devastating final twist .
The task is unambiguous and seemingly easy . I should be able to describe my view of an American man and his behavior because of my experience as an adult , a woman , a wife , a mother and , simply , a human being with various roles in life who has been happy a million times and unhappy a million times .
No . I think that I can depict this one American man within a certain period of time , but it is impossible to write the truth , since I have never seen him face - to - face . I can write subjectively and my observations of him through the Internet will be distorted by my own life , experience and the surroundings I live in .
Let me introduce one American I made friends with on Facebook .
I like his sense of humor , because he is able to make me smile .
His sensitivity is visible through his carefully chosen words , and his decency in his grammatically correct sentences .
I adore his imagination because he is able to take you away on a cloud to a never - never land .
He is wise and brave , because he was not scared to teach me , although he is not a teacher .
He is a man stuck in a generation where loyalty is just a tattoo , love is just a quote and lying is the new truth .
He is a man and I am a woman who live in the world , in which the man wears a short skirt and the woman is as tough as a crocodile .
How come ?
I would like to point out another of his attributes , which is his pride .
When I asked him if he had read the book The Little Prince by Exupéry because I was feeling like a fox , he asked me in an offended manner , if I knew Larry , the comedian .
Kyle is really proud , but so are all men .
I do n't believe in friendship between a man and a woman .
There will always be some kind of spark , either alluring or repulsing .
The next thing I like about him is that he never pushes me into anything .
So , he is thoughtful .
He aroused my own enslaved desires .
All men are .
In the following section I will write about his sexuality and dealing with an argument .
It was easy to draw him into the love affair or to make him horny , but it was quite difficult to start an argument with him . I think that he is a good writer because he is able to describe his sexual dreams and thoughts in a lively way and vividly .
However , ask him a question about his real life and he will give you a one - word answer .
This could hardly satisfy an ordinary questioner like me , not only an interviewer from a daily newspaper .
I believe he is tender and caring , but impatient and clumsy at the same time .
He forgets everything when he plunges into his Neverland .
As I wrote before , it was not that easy to have an argument with him .
I tried to use different strategic inputs that could help me to argue . For example : you are totally uninterested in reading between the lines ! You never listen to me ! I even called him a lummox and a stumblebum .
Yesterday , I wanted him to tell me the story of his life .
So , I asked him what his favourite sport was .
Kyle is a strong and charismatic individual and he values his privacy a lot .
And surely , I would .
However , I am not that crazy as to marry a man whom I do not know in real life .
But I identify with his view of male and female relationships .
Yellow is the female principle , gentle , cheerful and sensual .
As requested , this is a report concerning the environmental conditions in my town .
The information below evaluates the chief measures taken against pollution and environmental damage as well as the population 's interest and involvement in the optimum preservation of the area .
Through a series of programmes and events organised by local voluntary organisations , both adults and children are instructed about the importance of waste reduction and recycling .
Since exhaust fumes are considered to be one of the major pollutants nowadays , the local authorities are doing everything in their power in order to encourage citizens to travel more by means of public transport , to the detriment of the ubiquitous private cars .
Unfortunately , only a limited number of people are willing to leave their comfort zone for the sake of the community , thus making pollution caused by heavy traffic a remaining and inextricable problem of our society .
Our local public cleaning services are responsible not only for the efficient removal , storage , collection and transportation of waste material , but also for the maintenance and good care of natural areas and green spaces within our community .
The sole purpose of their activity is to keep our town clean and neat , making it an appealing and pleasurable place to live .
Taking everything into consideration , it would be fair to conclude that there are numerous ways in which one can protect the environment and take care of the area in which we reside .
However , as with all issues present within society , a dual commitment from the citizens and the authorities should be regarded as a key factor .
If we disturb a fire ant nest , they will relentlessly sting us , injecting poison into our body .
Even if we do n't , the stinging will cause a burning sensation , swelling and then a blister at the point of sting .
In mild cases , the sting causes itching .
In severe cases , it causes nausea , vomiting or dizziness .
In infested areas , they injure livestock , pets and wildlife , and damage crops , plants , electrical equipment , and irrigation systems .
There will be several inventions in the next years .
Moreover , it is a profitable task if they invent new medications to help people suffering from that illness .
It does not fit in rich countries because it concerns poor countries .
Altogether they provide the nutrients to cover the needs of feeding one person in one day .
I consider that it could contribute to feeding many people and it could definitely put an end to the most unfair problem of this world .
There must be something very special about a movie when , after the third time , you 're still leaving the cinema thinking " I have to see it again " .
Starring Italian comic Roberto Begnini ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) in the main role of Guido , this life - affirming tragi - comedy is about a Jewish father trying to shield his young son from the horrors of Nazism in the Italy of Mussolini .
To achieve this , Guido creates an imaginary game for his child once they are deported to a concentration camp .
He tells the boy that they are competing with others to win a tank , so the little Guiosué does n't realise what is really going on around him .
The strength of the movie relies on the goofy , loving , eccentric character played by Begnini , his exceptional comic talent and his ability as a director to deal with such a delicate topic as Nazism while managing to drive through a thick line between comedy and drama .
The Original soundtrack created by Nicola Piovanni is also a beautiful , delicate addition to this masterpiece .
Life is beautiful was the recipient of numerous awards , including three Oscars for best foreign picture , best actor and best original dramatic score .
What strikes me more is that , despite the fact that it 's set on the eve of the II world war , the film is n't really about the holocaust but is a bittersweet fable about human courage , love and hope .
If you haven't seen it already , which I doubt , I highly recommend it ; it will make you laugh out loud but also along the way you 'll find yourself covered in tears , I guarantee .
When I joined the freshman year team , I did n't realize what I was getting into .
You see , football is more of a mental sport than anything else , so running on the track was n't only about getting in shape . We would push our minds by running as hard as we could , even if we felt like we were going to pass out .
Then , after the third game , I had a season - ending injury .
Needless to say , I was sidelined for the rest of the season , but this actually helped me realize that , since you never know when your last game will be , you should try your hardest in football and life .
After freshman year , I decided that I would always give my best .
Playing varsity football has taught me so much more than just what my assignments are on a particular game or how to block . I have learned to think about others first , and realized how important working hard is .
The answer , of course , is no , because you can always put it in another gear , even if you think you need to give up .
Honestly , I could not agree more , as the website as it is available today is an inconvenient tool providing insufficient information .
Second , the theme is outdated , and developing a new design can be a good move to attract more clients .
As to other aspects of our website , it might be a good idea to enhance its performance by means of optimizing the code and removing advertisements ( which decrease the website 's value while bringing little profit ) .
All these tasks can be completed within a month , and I would be glad to be involved in the improvement of our website , as it is an important aspect of our work , because it represents the company , and representation is key where attracting clients is concerned .
Secondly , there are two sorts of schools in Spain - public and private - , which leads to a big difference in the educational knowledge .
I obviously agree that technology is necessary nowadays .
So , schools and educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach .
Technology does not imply a new instrument being taught but a new tool and source of knowledge ( if used correctly ) .
In fact , using technology without changing the content would be a total failure .
Moreover , they should include the past information and the new information .
In other words , technology should be used as a tool for students to be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages .
These new technologies also help in the development of teaching .
We can make dynamic classes by being in contact with other schools . In the case of subjects such as English and French , students would improve their skills by being in contact with students from different countries .
Also , teachers could replace their methodologies following the best ones and the ones which contribute to having qualified students trained to face everyday life situations .
In conclusion , as a great teacher said , we have 21st century students learning with 20th century tools 19th century knowledge .
Thus , there should n't be a technological revolution but an educational one .
I am writing to express my concern about the new smoking ban law .
At present , I am working for Cafe Noir , a well - known restaurant popular with visitors , many of whom have told me that if such a ban were introduced , they would not go into restaurants and , instead , they would meet friends at home .
On top of that , I think the amount of notice you have given people is unreasonable .
There needs to be much wider public debate , and if a majority agree , they should be given enough time to get used to it .
There were not enough police to go round checking every public place .
Secondly , businesses suffered , with people objecting that they should be given the right to smoke if they wished .
We will talk about a technology that might soon disrupt the world .
But first let me explain the process followed to manufacture anything .
The manufacturing process follows three main stages : designing , then producing , then consuming .
More efficient production means cheaper goods , and by providing them more cheaply the consumer now has the ability to purchase more of these goods .
In other words , money will have more value .
So , let 's say , you have $ 100,000 now . You would have $ 10,000,000 fifty years from now .
You could then pay off your debts , get a new car , buy a new house , invest or retire , or do just about anything you would do if you currently had $ 10,000,000 in your bank account .
Looking at it through a broader lens , country deficits would be solved , hungry people would be fed , and the homeless would be accommodated .
This is the effect of a reduction in the cost of production ; lower production costs allow the producer to reduce the price of his goods while maintaining the initial profit .
Surprisingly , the producer gets to maintain his profits due to the proportional decrease in price as well as the cost to produce .
This automatic , efficient , quick , precise technology reduces the amount of labor needed , saves waste initially caused by human errors , saves time and produces at better quality too .
In conclusion , this revolutionary technology has the potential to vastly improve the way we manufacture our goods , and in the process of doing that , benefit the whole world .
Dogs and cats are called " furkids " not only because their bodies are covered with fur , but also because their owners regard their pets as kids .
I can still recall the day Cathy and I took Casino to Taipei City Hall , walking him along the department store pavement , and playing with him all day long .
He changed my attitude toward dogs . Casino taught me through his patience and passions .
Ever since I met him , I have stopped feeling frightened when facing big dogs , and have even started to play with them .

Dear Mrs Ashby ,
I am interested in applying for the job vacancy at the Cafe you run .
The reason for applying is that I believe I would be a perfect candidate as I have plenty of experience in the food industry as well as being extremely interested in working for this well - known company .
I strongly believe I would be the right person for the post as I consider myself polite , well - mannered , enthusiastic and good at dealing with customers .
Besides , working in popular restaurants has enabled me to gain the ability to work as part of a team and under pressure , as well as to learn about a wide variety of international foods and dishes .
What is more , I am used to working long hours on both day and night shifts , so busy days will not be a problem for me at all .
Finally , I would like to express my willingness to work for you as this would be such a great experience for me .
Regarding my level of English , I speak fluent English and got an A in the Cambridge First Certificate Exam .
I also have been helping a nine - year - old kid with his math homework .
I also love doing sports , such as tennis , soccer , canoeing and kayaking .
I always try so hard not to go to new restaurants because I do n't like most of them at first .
It was my brother 's birthday , so he asked if we could go to a new restaurant called Muerde La Pasta .
I 'd always heard about that place , so I thought it would be okay to go .
It 's a free buffet , so you can take everything you want … there are chips , pizzas , all types of pasta and then there 's a lot of desserts and there 's no food limit haha .
The staff is so good , they are really helpful and they are always looking to see if you 've finished to take the dirty dishes away .
Honestly , I thought I would n't like the restaurant , but I was completely wrong .. I loved it !
I 'm going with my friends next week ! ! I think you get more than what you pay for as its unlimited food and you only have to pay 10 Euros .
If you haven't been yet , you should definitely do it . I promise you will love it !
You can never really say a thing is bad unless you have indulged yourself in it .
You can never really say a situation is unfortunate unless you have already been in it .
And you can never really say a teacher in the mountains is miserable unless you have experienced being one .
When I found out I would be assigned to Gala National High School , I said it was the worst thing that had ever happened in my career .
When I found out I would be teaching at the most remote high school in Ozamiz , I said I was very unfortunate , and when I found out I would be spending my days in the mountains , I said my life would be miserable .
Indeed , negative vibes filled my thoughts after finding out that I was to practice my chosen profession in the place I feared the most .
To have been assigned to the mountains is never the worst situation ; I have never been unfortunate , and misery has never been my colleague .
In fact , being a teacher in the mountains is being the best of who I am , being the most fortunate of men alive , and being the happiest I could ever be .
Here , I have learned more than the lessons I have taught .
It has taught me lessons I could n't have learned had I not been here - lessons that not only help me improve my teaching career , but also help me become the right person for my vocation .
I may be far still from being an ideal one , but I know someday , having Gala as my guiding light , I can become one .
As to my colleagues , I am grateful to be in a small group of individuals who , most of the time , share the same line of interest with me .
We are so small in number , but that does not prevent us holding any school program and activity at its best .
With our sheer creativity and enthusiasm , we always make it a point that every school activity is worthwhile .
We never settle for any mediocrity .
Together , we aspire to something beyond better .
It 's not all the time that we are in good terms , but we know in ourselves that we care for each other .
And that 's all that matters .
At first , it was an extreme challenge for me to handle students in the mountains .
Every day , I have got to deal with students wearing different faces of life 's resentment .
As a teacher , it took me everything I have to come to terms with every pitiful fate of my students .
Hence , the value of UNDERSTANDING the students , even beyond what the meaning of such a word can express , has been dramatically instilled in me .
And that 's one of the lessons I consider a gem to keep for myself forever .
Students in the mountains have a lot of different untold stories of their lives .
These stories , once heard , can open somebody 's heart to learn to love learners despite everything .
That is exactly what happened to me .
As I have listened to my students , I have come to realize the very essence of my existence as their teacher .
I may have not perfectly carried out my responsibilities , but I know somehow in my one - year stay in Gala , I have made a difference to my students ' lives .
My students have a lot of weaknesses in many aspects of life , but seeing them enduring motivated me even more to give them good reasons to keep on keeping on .
My dear students may not have known it , but really , they too are the source of my inner strength .
I have more than enough reasons to do that - and they are again , my students .
In a nutshell , Gala may have been very far , yet in my heart , it 's just within .
The place , my colleagues , and my dear students are enough testimony to the fact that , in Gala , I have found a home … and a family to love , really for real .
I am writing to you regarding a job advertisement I saw in yesterday 's newspaper looking for an English - speaking person to work at weekends in your cafe .
I like trying dishes from all over the world and I am keen on cooking and experimenting with new exotic cuisines .
As a consequence , I am prepared to work long hours .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Sir ,
It is not an easy task to explain the importance of this exam for me , since I do not have any specific objective in mind that requires a Cambridge certificate .
Similarly , I do not have any study methods in the sense of systematic mechanisms for learning English .
Next , I started to read books such as the Harry Potter series and books by George R. R. Martin .
About the reasons for taking the test , there is little to say .
As I have said , I have been learning English for the sheer pleasure of it ; but , having come this far , I think it is time to get some kind of formal recognition of my level .
Lots of people think that teenagers are stupid , have little knowledge about life , do not have enough experience , are annoying , difficult to understand .
In my opinion , we should n't think like that .
I agree that some young people behave really badly ; they smoke , shout at their parents , drink beer , do not improve themselves .
But most teenagers are even more intelligent than adults or elderly people .
At school and at home , they have to cope with lots of problems and try to solve them .
They sometimes have to help their friends or even their parents with difficult things like psychological problems , give them tips .
Sometimes it happens that a couple who have a child aged from 12 - 16 , quarrels .
Teenagers also have to make serious decisions like choosing secondary school , future job , which way they will go in their life , if they want to be in a relationship with someone .
This way , you not only gather plain data but also emotions from people .
Additionally , it happens that while speaking of a particular event , suddenly more memories and stories come to the narrator 's mind .
This is an impressive way to document a change over many years , but on the other hand , it is challenging to keep photographs in good condition .
For me personally , the best way to collect and record information for future generations is to interview people and to store the information in an appropriate way for three reasons : Firstly , I have the chance of not getting just one story from a person , but maybe two or three more .
Secondly , I can catch the narrator 's emotions .
Thirdly , I do not have to be concerned about the loss of quality of photographs and pictures .
When I was in Bali , I had a great night that I will always remember .
My husband and I went to a dinner on the beach of our hotel .
The weather was very good and we enjoyed having dinner barefoot , sitting on the sand .
When we thought that the night had ended , we had the perfect dessert .
Despite it being very dark , we could see something moving on the sand .
it was lost and could n't find the way to the water .
They turned the turtle and took it to the water , where they freed it .
Then the turtle started swimming and disappeared from our sight .
We were very happy because of seeing the turtle and hope to go back to Bali to see it again .
Visiting your own country certainly has its advantages .
In addition , if you plan your vacation at the last minute , you can also save money on planes or hotels .
In conclusion , I think it 's important to know both our own countries and foreign lands .
It was in August , my parents and my brother were on holiday in Mallorca for a week , and that same day my sister and her boyfriend had travelled from Yecla to Paris on a package tour .
At that moment , I thought that an accident or a similar something had happened to my family , but fortunately it was n't so .
A girl was on the other end of the phone and she told me that my sister and her boyfriend were n't with the other passengers .
It is a fantastic film with beautiful scenery and an exciting story .
The main character , Walter Mitty , works for a well - known magazine , " Life " , as a manager of photo negatives .
In his letter he says that one shot from the film is the best picture he has ever taken .
Unfortunately , Walter can not find the shot , so he has to look for the traveller , which is not easy .
He has to travel to remote parts of the world and have some really amazing adventures .
I wo n't tell you any more as it could spoil the story , but the film is definitely worth watching .
In addition , I can say that I was charmed by the main character who is developing throughout the whole film .
If you like complicated stories about dreams and how to make them come true , this story is definitely for you .
Easy on the pocket & frequented by the locals , there is a dining gem in Nova Gorica .
There you will find a parking area and some basketball courts , and on further exploration , just after the basketball courts & walking towards that famous bridge that you can now see much better , a restaurant .
For seasonal food served by obliging & good - humoured waiters , you will find nowhere better .
In summer , that samovar of dark liquid beside the entrance might be Kopriva chai , a summer herbal digestif , favoured by the villagers of the region , or you might be offered a World War One dish such as soldiers may have eaten in this area .
Day , date and season dictate the always interesting & changing menu at this restaurant .
The warm interior is the perfect place to eat in winter , while in summer , many diners prefer the outside tables beside the turquoise Soca river .
One of Slovenia 's qualified sommeliers will help you choose from the good wine cellar , so this is the place where I recommend our class can relax , eat , drink well & enjoy the happy atmosphere .
The film is set in France in the nineteenth century .
The idea lying behind the story is that justice and the law are not the same thing .
The main character , Jean Valdjean , played by Hugh Jackman , is jailed for stealing a loaf of bread in a bid to prevent his nephew 's death .
Then , after being set free , he becomes a thief again . However , this time he is not condemned because of a prier .
But do not worry , I am not going to spoil the ending .
All this occurs during the first part of the film .
All in all , I think that it is one of the best films ever made .
Cars are improving , becoming safer and more environmentally friendly .
A lot of effort has been put into reducing the exhaust fumes , etc .
Moreover , people have become more aware of environmental protection .
Thus , more and more people , when buying a new car , also consider its environment friendliness and the possible impact on the community .
Also , cars are becoming more affordable in many countries .
For example , in India and China the technological advances have enabled them to mass produce really affordable cars , which are also imported .
However , there might still be room for public transport in the future , especially in big cities .
Although I do n't really like watching soap operas , I started watching this particular show with my family .
My mother likes watching soap operas on TV and she got me hooked on this new TV show - iknmp .
The show looked promising in its promos , which were based on a very famous old Hindi song .
The lead actors were well - known TV stars .
The couple have 4 kids and , after separation , 2 kids live with their mom and 2 with their dad .
The dad , who is a cardiologist , moves to the US and starts a new life there .
The mom , on the other hand , decides to stay behind and works hard to give her children a decent life .
The show starts with the eldest daughter , who lives with her mother , trying to contact her father to ask him to be a part of her wedding ceremony .
The father , who had vowed to never look back , at first ignores her requests . However , upon insistence from his other children and his sister , agrees to go back to India .
Although not very realistic , the show is fun to watch as it brings out the Indian values and , at the same time , teaches the importance of women being independent and able to live life on their own .
Innovative entrepreneurship can be perceived as a special process of creating , testing and implementing new products and materials , new methods of resource utilization and the new kind of management in business processes to find advanced opportunities for ( non)commercial use .
The first test has shown that I am very motivated and my skills almost fit with the possibility of being an entrepreneur .
It is important to underline that the driving factors ( motivation ) determine the behaviour of an entrepreneur and show the reasons for acting .
In the test the answers were accessed and I was found to be a person that has high control appeal , meaning that I have great leadership skills and a need to organize and to moderate .
In the motivation part , I also received a high score in needing challenges , as I prefer to take difficult projects because I believe that they might develop my knowledge and abilities .
Moreover , it is really important for me to be my own boss , even though it involves many more responsibilities .
Nevertheless , in the test , I received fewer points in " need for achievement / success " than were required for being an entrepreneur .
As I found out , there were two problems regarding lack of points .
The first one was based on the profit orientation of the entrepreneur in the test .
The above - mentioned situation means that during the assessment other goals that an entrepreneur might have were not taking into account .
For instance , it this be social sustainability and a need to develop the local employment situation or entrepreneurship as a hobby / lifestyle .
The second problem was based on the essential role of getting feedback .
However , the test evaluated parents ' and friends ' opinions as important feedback and I do not agree that it is essential , unless they are specialists in that field .
Nevertheless , I might take a reasonable risk if it can positively influence business .
I 'm not going to spend a lot of money on a ticket , because I 'm studying so I just have a part - time job .
If we check the prices of air travel , we can be disappointed , the same is true of travel by boat .
Fortunately , train tickets are cheaper .
A plane flies very quickly , but you have to be at the airport at least an hour earlier .
Travelling by train is quite fast , and pleasant , I can travel safely to more places worldwide than people taking a boat or plane transport .
After the summary is to certify that travelling by train is the most advantageous , but the most important reason why I chose travelling by train is the fact that I have motion sickness , and I 'm afraid to fly .
At the end of a decade in which technology has made enormous leaps , I am thinking about how much our current idea of the house will change in the future .
Despite many differences in human nature , the current houses do not differ so much between themselves .
On the other hand , recently , many new and more advanced projects are realised more often by daring architects .
But can you imagine that in the near , unspecified future , all homes will be like that ?
Built using the most modern technology , full of the latest inventions which man can create ?
Of course , for people to live better , but it would be useful for modern houses to be constructed so as not to damage the environment .
I think quite a few scientists still surprise us , and the house of the future will go beyond the limits of our imagination .
There have been major changes regarding teaching methods in the last few years , but there is still room for improvement .
If we focus on the teaching of English as a foreign language , we could possibly see this more clearly .
In the early 1980s , activity in the classroom was focused on grammar .
However , speaking , listening activities and the massive use of I.T . mark the schedule nowadays .
The new teaching approach is based on how students can effectively use the language , rather than on the knowledge of the language they actually have .
This new outlook on teaching methods consists of the use of so - called alternative assessment as a way to evaluate learners ' skills .
A grammar test shows knowledge about the language , whereas alternative assessment shows learners ' ability to effectively use the language in the context of a real situation .
There are many reasons for using alternative assessment techniques : learners demonstrate things learned , take responsibility , motivation may increase and they have the opportunity to use language for real - life purposes .
It is important to note that the difficulty implementing the changes to the new teaching approach referred to above lies not with the students themselves but with the older generation of teachers , since they sometimes have trouble applying the new outlook on education methods .
In conclusion : the way of teaching has been changing in the last few years all over Spain .
The main reason for that can be found by surveying the related to new teaching methods developed recently .
However , a smooth transition to the new approach is still necessary to overcome the massive education - related challenges Spain will have to face in the coming years .
In the year 2020 , there was conflict between Japan and the United States .
The conflict was due to trend creation ; citizens of both countries wanted to see who created better and bigger trends .
Law enforcers also wanted their country to win , and in the United States , policemen arrested any Japanese person they saw and sent them back to Japan .
Once the day was over , the Japanese government tried to reverse all of the damage done , but it was impossible .
Japan asked the United States for help . They gladly agreed , and they dragged Japan back up to their normal status .
Japan launched a counterattack and enslaved the United States , and then proceeded to conquer the world .
A new era was created . It was the most brutal period in the history of mankind . It was known as many things . Most people named it " The Japan Era " , but it was so brutal that the official name was " The Dark Yellow Era " .
I would like to recommend the following movie : " The Perfume " .
This movie can be considered a classical thriller , but with several aspects that makes it unique in this genre .
First of all , the historical period is the Victorian age in France .
The landscapes are really wonderful .
The buildings , dress , and habits of the population are displayed in full detail .
Secondly , we have an amazing script that can be considered unique .
The story tells us the importance of perfume in all aspects of our lives .
The movie 's main plot describes the early years of our protagonist , a poor orphan , who takes advantage of his powerful sense of smell to find new jobs .
Finally , we will discover a fantastic ending that we would never imagine through watching the movie .
The overall standard of this movie is really high and it is a movie to remember forever .
Nevertheless , this is not an all audiences movies , because it contains hard scenes not suitable for children .
If people can rent this movie or watch it online , I would encourage to them watch it as soon as possible .
Many people believe that public transport will be replaced by private transport in the near future .
The main reason is the convenience of travelling by car in comparison with using public transport .
Apart from that , there are many other benefits to buying a car instead of using buses or the underground every day .
First of all , a car gives such a valuable thing as privacy .
For example , driving a car , we can wear whatever we want and listen to the music at any volume .
If the car is large enough , it can even be a perfect place for sleep .
Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find a quiet and pleasant place outside the city .
Public transport can take us only to certain locations .
Thus , it is clear that private transport such as cars has plenty of advantages .
On the other hand , we can encounter different problems while travelling by car .
For instance , sitting in traffic jams always steals a lot of our precious time .
It means that travelling by car can even be more dangerous than using public transport .
Generally , bus drivers are much more experienced than car drivers . Therefore , accidents caused by public transport happen quite rarely .
Thus , I would argue that driving a car requires a lot of attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can do serious harm to other people .
After that , she dressed up and went to the kitchen to make breakfast .
After eating a delicious salad and drinking tea , she went to her room to do her hair and put her make - up on .
Anna was a bit stressed , but she was sure , that everything would be alright .
She went down and opened the door - it was her mother .
They hugged and smiled at each other .
She came in and noticed that her daughter was a little nervous , so she decided to make a coffee , and sit and talk for a while .
As they were talking , Anna 's best friends came .
After some time , her friends came down and told Anna 's mother , that she was ready and she was going to come in a while .
Her mum went to her and hugged her really affectionately . "
One also learns to work hard and be disciplined in order to achieve success .
All these points have led to me playing basketball for almost thirty years now and I 'm still hooked on it .
If someone asked me for advice on how to start playing basketball , I would probably suggest starting with a trial practice and if the person enjoys it , he / she could join the club .
It is situated in the city center , near the seaport .
It is a different kind of restaurant , because you can find not only the typical Spanish food , but also dishes from different parts of the world .
What I like most about this restaurant is that it offers healthy and balanced food , the flavor is fantastic , the food very tasty and carefully cooked .
You can enjoy good quality ordinary food on a budget .
On the other hand , the surroundings are modern , the place is airy and cosy .
The waiters are very welcoming and informative , so you feel very comfortable .
In my opinion , the salad is the best option , with a wide range of types from different countries .
Finally , I really recommend this restaurant , especially for couples or friends that want to try something different and newfangled .
Unfortunately , we did n't get the chance to see each other that night .
For two hours , I served drinks .
At the end of the evening , I worked in the parking lot .
All in all , a great experience ! You can rely on my help next year !

Canada is a nation built by citizen - soldiers .
His death shocked the nation .
I am 44 , of Austrian nationality , married and hold the Cambridge English Advanced certificate since last summer .
I am also experienced with children , having looked after my sister 's daughters , aged 9 , 11 and 14 for years now .
Whenever possible , I take the girls out for a swim or a ride on their bikes .
It is also a good idea to play badminton and mini - golf with them .
Also , I worked as an au - pair in France and Canada , where I looked after 3 , and 2 children , respectively .
I look forward to receiving your reply at your earliest convenience .
Yours faithfully ,
It 's a website which allows me to taste food from around the world without moving from my city , at the same time as you can speak different languages and meet new people .
The best thing about this website is that it is very easy to use .
First , you have to select the city ; New York , Barcelona , etc .
You can use this website if you are a tourist or just someone who wants to enjoy a dinner in your own city .
On the other hand , if you are a professional or an amateur chef , you 'll earn extra money .
There 's nothing like sharing a meal with local people . It offers you the possibility to glean information from someone who lives in the place .
My niece 's wedding was celebrated in Barcelona last weekend .
First of all , my mother , my children , my partner and I took the train from Zaragoza to go to Barcelona .
When we arrived in Barcelona , we went by taxi to the hotel which my brother had previously booked , and there we met with other relatives : my brother , his wife , my nephews and , of course , my niece ( the bride ) .
We all went together to have lunch at a nearby restaurant .
The marriage ceremony took place in a wonderful church . There were flowers everywhere , live music , three hundred guests and , of course , the bride and the bridegroom , the most beautiful and happy couple I have ever seen as far as I can remember .
The party was held in a large garden near the bridegroom 's parents ' house .
The dinner was a three - course meal which had been carefully chosen by the newly - weds .
The party continued with splendid dancing until seven in the morning .
If you are wealthy , or you come from a family where your father can provide you with most of the things you want , I suggest going to college straight away would be a good idea .
Some of us are afraid to travel because of the recent cases of ISIS terrorism .
Mass shootings , bombs , hacking into security systems can happen any time , any day .
However , for those who really need to fork out money to pay college loans , it is best for them to take a year off and work part - time in a cafe , or somewhere remotely interesting .
It is wise for them to find some time to save some money so they will not need to struggle during college .
However , some just want to have some fun , after years in high school , after so many years of break - ups , after so many years of eating cafeteria food , it is time to find some enjoyable time with quality friends and with mouth - watering food .
In their minds , it is all about having fun , but is that really what it is ?
What if they change into some monster they can not suppress ?
One day in the post office , I had an argument with a man who studied at the same university as me , and I challenged him to fight with me : I thought it would solve the problem between us .
After that , he told the teacher who was responsible for that class , and she called me into her room and asked me questions .
This story tells us that sometimes we can not control ourselves , but we should be alone and think positively or take a deep breath , and that will make us calm down .
Hi , my name is Priscila and I have just realized that I am a writer , too .
That was the first time my work was assessed on the way I wrote in English .
Because of my work , I have to write all the time , to my students , to my colleagues and to the academic community in general .
I expect that this course will help me develop my English skills , so that I can write my papers , communicate and discuss my research in a more effective way .
In the modern world , public transport has become less important as travelling by car is said to be more convenient . Travelling by car also reduces people 's journey time and they do n't need to wait for a particular bus .
It may also be because , as people are getting richer , they do n't need to use public transport as a more comfortable option is always there waiting for them .
The world is moving faster and everyone has to be fast enough to compete in this modern world .
While comparing the drawbacks of public transport with modernized vehicles , public transport may not seem to be a better choice .
Although the maintenance cost of car is quite expensive , it does not stop people from using cars , since convenience matters to them the most and not money .
Many people think that public transport is only for the poor and not for the rich .
If it continues , no resources will be spared for the future generation .
Nowadays , many people around the globe are trying to acquire a second language . When it comes to deciding between learning in our own country and learning abroad , we can find several pros and cons that might make us fairly confused .
To sum up , the best way of learning English , or rather the best place to do it , depends on each person 's means and learning style , but it is definitely possible to acquire a second language both at home and abroad .
People try to skip Good Friday because , there are no feasts no that day .
Moreover , it is the most sombre day of the year , which recalls the Crucifixion caused by people 's sins .
People prefer to meet happiness and positive thinking to talking about death and suffering .
Accordingly , the author compares Easter to a pagan spring festival , where people were joyful because of spring coming just as a Christian is joyful about the Resurrection .
People choose pleasant entertainments instead of talking about death , suffering and self - sacrifice .
Everyone is individual and worries about themselves , because it is an easier way to live .
Above all , people are not used to undergoing suffering and , what is more brutal , death .
4 . The author mentions the origin of the word ' compassion ' , in order to remind people of the meaning of that word .
It means to ' suffer with ' .
Nevertheless , people keep this compassion tidied away , because it is too painful for them to stand .
Not only do they run away from uncomfortable situations , but they also prefer to see them on screens .
My school friends and I went to the Dominican Republic . It 's a Caribbean country with amazing beaches .
I remember we got there on the first of October on a Saturday night , and I will never forget the rush of warmth I felt as soon as I stepped out of the plane .
When we got to the resort , we all checked in and went to our designated rooms . I was sharing a room with my friend Emily .
After unpacking , we left our room to look around the rest of the resort .
Since television was first invented , it has influenced different aspects of people 's lives .
Since television was launched onto the market , it has acquired other purposes besides entertaining , such as communicating and advertising . That is why the possibility of it having educational purposes has been widely discussed .
Television can certainly educate , it has great potential for doing so , because of the way it presents information and the range of people it can reach .
Television can educate in several ways . To mention some : by providing and extending information given on certain courses at school , and by providing information that is not even taught at school .
It is very exciting that entertainment and education can be merged to accomplish the spread of knowledge among the masses in an enjoyable way .
Television series , contests , movies , and news do it all the time without us being aware of it .
I am writing regarding the advertisement for USA SUMMER CAMPS .
I found this advertisement in the newspaper and I would like to state the reasons why I think I am suitable for the job advertised .
The groups I was in charge of mostly consisted of people of ages 6 to 12 , although I once had a chance to work with a group of young adults as well .
Everywhere I have worked before , I have been praised for being very organised and having the ability to deal with unexpected situations successfully .
Usually , I do n't have much time to spend on myself , since I am always occupied with something .
I have been a member of a basketball team since the age of 5 and I have recently become a young ladies ' group 's coach .
I did that for three summers and I still help out at my parents ' restaurant when a they are in need of a hand .
I would really appreciate it if you could take my application into consideration .
I am writing in response to your advertisement , which I saw in the International Newspaper to apply for the job in the USA Summer Camps .
This year , I finished my degree in Mathematics at the University of Zaragoza and in September , I will start to study to become a teacher .
I have also studied English for ages and I think that I have a good level .
Moreover , this job would be an excellent experience to improve my English and make me more self - confident .
As for my experience , I love working with children and I sometimes take care of my nieces who are 10 years old .
My degree took up all my free time this year . However , I tried to go on doing sport , especially running and playing football . I also try to keep up with the latest trends in sports events .
I would describe myself as a sociable , responsible , trustworthy and hardworking person who likes working with children .
My favorite sport is football , but it is not a sport that I like to play , it 's a sport to watch because it 's beautiful , very cool and very exciting to support a team in a championship .
I am Brazilian , and like almost everybody in my country , I 'm a big football fan .
The World Cup is happening now in my country , Brazil .
I love it when this event happens , so many incredible games going on , the best players in the world , three games per day at the start , and with very good - looking players .
I do n't know what exactly happens , but in every World Cup the atmosphere changes , everybody becomes happier , Mc Donalds launches the tastiest hamburgers , people go out to watch games with friends in bars or they meet in somebody 's house .
I love the World Cup despite the fact that it being in Brazil has brought a lot of political problems , or just shown us how corrupt our government can be with the huge overpriced projects , a lot of money that has been spent on unfinished stadiums , with shameful delays in their construction , etc .
I love the World Cup , but I certainly would have preferred it if it had been in another country .
Also , it helps you to release the daily stress and is a good motivator .
You start walking 10 minutes each day , then for 20 minutes and you can add more minutes till you start running for 30 minutes and then for an hour .
In winter , you need to put on heavy clothes , while in summer lighter clothes , a hat and a pair of glasses will be all you need .
In winter I go running for half an hour in the afternoons , but in summer I go out and run in the mornings and in the afternoons to enjoy the nice weather .
Being a person that loves sports , it is hard for me to see myself gaining pounds through the years .
Once I decided that I needed to do something , I started walking around my neighbourhood .
I was still out of breath sometimes , but I kept doing it because I wanted to achieve my goal of losing 10 pounds .
And now I run 4 miles a day .
Based on my understanding of this position , you offer full on - the - job training to your employees and encourage their involvement with all laboratory activities .
As a meticulous , organized and result - oriented biologist , I pay great attention to detail , am skilled at gathering data and used to keeping detailed records .
In addition , working closely with a team of dedicated researchers has helped me understand the importance of efficient lab practice and develop my group - oriented skills .
As a result , I am well prepared to collaborate with interdisciplinary teams as well as to be effective at independent work when I am required to use my own initiative to complete a task or solve a problem .
Beyond my coursework , I have taken an active role in international volunteer activities for three years , in the last of which I coordinated projects from beginning to end .
This leadership role required proficient communication skills , as I was providing support to people of different ages , backgrounds ( with varying levels of English ) or levels of technical ability .
With my relevant coursework , lab experience , committed and adaptable attitude , I am confident of excelling in this position . I would welcome the opportunity to join your team and put my skills to work for your laboratory .
Referring to the job advertisement published on your homepage in September 2014 , I would like to apply for the position as a Analytical Development Team Member .
I am a student in the last semester of a Molecular Life Sciences program and I am looking for an analytical job .
Therefore , I was very interested to read on your website that you have a new position as an Analytical Team Member .
An apprenticeship as a chemical lab technician in a high standard company and a Bachelor of Life Sciences with specialization in analytical chemistry make me a highly suitable candidate for the position .
Furthermore , I have worked successfully for a year after my apprenticeship with different kinds of analytical methods and I was able to improve my knowledge in this area .
Besides , I have always worked productively in a team and GMP was common .
I am confident that my experience and interpersonal skills will strengthen the team .
I am eagerly looking forward to hearing from you .
Scout ( Jean Louise ) Finch is a rounded character .
from her outer appearance , she seems like a little girl .
Talking about her outer appearance , one can easily see that Scout is not " the usual " girl .
Scout 's character is kind of a tomboy .
She does not like to dress like a lady . Even when aunt Alexandra tries to make a lady out of her , Scout refuses to dress or speak like one .
At a young age , before she went to school , she started reading .
Her intelligence at a young age was a problem for her teacher , Miss Caroline , because she had never had such a well - educated pupil before .
Instead of celebrating it , she somehow inhibits Scout 's learning .
Due to that , Scout gets bored and starts to hate school .
Furthermore , Scout often reacts very impulsively , mostly at a young age .
Also , when she has trouble with her cousin , because she called Atticus a " nigger - lover " , Scout beats her up .
For her , it is a way to make her mind clear .
Later on , Scout begins to understand , not least because of her father and brother , that it is important to think before talking .
Somehow , she reverts back to her old ways .
To conclude , Scout is a smart girl with two sides .
On the one hand , Scout acts very impulsively and is an obstreperous tomboy , but on the other hand , she is very clever and more adult than others at her age .
So , you need information about my country 's eating customs ?
On weekdays , Dutch people take their breakfast , which usually consists of a few sandwiches , somewhere between 7.00 and 8.00 a.m. At the weekend , we tend to sleep in and , therefore , take our breakfast a bit later .
The most important ones are probably hotpots : mashed potatoes and vegetables , often combined with smoked sausage .
A traditional Dutch meal which I think is far more tasty , consists of thick little pancakes , served warm with melted butter and icing sugar .
In a few hours , I can get to some far - away destination .
Boat trips are long and boring .
In today 's intercultural world , one of the best assets people and nations can have is tolerance and a deep appreciation of cultural values different from their own .
However , it is probably a truism that reading about or watching films about a country are only pale substitutes for actually going to visit a place and experiencing the differences yourself .
People started emerging from their houses , their faces petrified with fear .
But there was only one person who knew what and where that explosion had occurred .
Just a day before Michael , was arguing with his friends that Rasheed was a very nice guy .
So what if he originated from the Arab peninsula ? That does not imply that he is a terrorist .
He has been living in the U.K . for the past 20 years .
But this act was beyond question .
This was something that could not be argued about .
Not knowing what the intelligent thing to do would be , the first thing that came to his mind was calling the police .
Sprinted towards what seemed like flames , only to find Rasheed standing across it , blood pouring from his right hand .
Knowing that he had jeopardized his friendship with Rasheed , he quietly returned to his house .
Whenever there is a possibility to buy a new item , one should do it .
Shopping has become a way of life for some people , who see it as a hobby as well as a pleasant activity .
Suffice it to say , buying new items may be viewed as a waste of time .
Often , it turns out , a purchase should not take place at all , the reason being lack of money .
Likewise , the joy of shopping is dependent upon the items one intends to purchase .
Obviously , shopping for food is not equivalent to purchasing clothes .
The article " Stairways to Heaven : Gothic Architecture , Heavy Metal , and the Aesthetics of Transcendence " is an unparalleled one in terms of the discussion it provokes .
The author starts his discussion by discussing his particular passion for Gothic architecture , and this passion is rather vivid throughout the entire article .
In order to explain the nature of Gothic architecture and its major aspects , the author efficiently employs musical analogies .
One of the major arguments in the article is the comparison between Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal rock music .
Bork believes this very comparison to be an efficient one , as it employs parallels that are easily understandable for a wider audience due to the utilization of simple terms that they can relate to .
Furthermore , he finds that there are many similarities between the development of Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal rock music .
For example , the purpose of both is to induce awe and they both employ the concepts of distortion ( Bork 1 ) .
What is more , these styles usually tend to abandon classical tendencies , and both rose in response to a new demand in the culture .
The number of people using public transport far outstrips the number of people the transport system was designed to handle .
The trains and buses are crowded , and newer routes do not reflect the changing demand .
Mass production has made cars more affordable for the middle class in recent years .
Both these factors have led to increased purchasing of cars over the last few years .
This trend is likely to continue in the future .
Cars have the ability to take you from your home to your place of work without any stopovers .
Then , after you get off the train , you again have to find your way to your destination by either walking or using another mode of transport .
She breathed a heavy sigh of relief as all the panic was finally over for her !
Her cherry - red face glistened vigorously in the golden brown sunset like a perfectly baked pastry , as the last of the sun 's rays beamed down over the horizon .
Spring is a good season because it is between winter and summer , temperatures are not too cold and not too hot .
You can walk and smell the flowers beginning to bloom .
Summer is great because it 's time to put your feet up and relax .
When you drive through the neighborhoods you notice that families are all gathered in some kind of celebration .
That is why I am writing this letter , to let you know what is happening in the city and to tell you that the police are not doing their job .
I would also like you to talk to the police department , because the police have to do their job and make sure we are all safe , not ignore us and say that everything is fine when everything is wrong .
I had never felt so nervous ... I looked at the audience . Everyone was looking at me .
On the left , I saw my parents . Okay , inhale , exhale , I can do this .
I have always dreamed of this , being a musical star on Broadway .
I competed in singing competitions when I was younger and I took acting classes .
I arrived in New York four months ago .
When I was taking a walk through the neighbourhood , I saw this poster about the musical Wicked and they were looking for someone to play the lead .
Of course , I took this opportunity and two weeks later I had to do an audition .
I felt like I messed up , but the next day I got a call that I got the role .
And finally , the moment was there , the opening night .
I put on my costume and walked on stage . I had to wait until the curtains opened .
Many people still consider television only as a way to relax , be entertained and stop thinking about all the problems that might worry them .
As it is a very common phenomenon among teenagers , schools should show them that television also enables you to learn something new .
A clear example is that watching television in another language is of vital importance if you aim to learn new vocabulary or improve your comprehension skills , and it makes studying a language really fun and enjoyable .
If I had to choose whether to consider television educational or not , I would definitely say it is .
Nevertheless , we should use it in an appropriate way and be careful about what are the sources of the information told during a TV show , as it might be misleading .
I 'm sure that you wo n't be disappointed with the town I live in because there is a lot to see !
I 'm really keen to show you all the interesting places around .
To my mind , you 're probably totally exhausted because of travel and those first few days when you had to get to know your new surroundings .
So , as you asked me , I 'll propose an interesting place to visit where you could take a rest and relax .
Kachl 's Park is a perfect place to spend some time walking along paths , sitting on a bench , talking to each other .
In the public garden there are two ponds ( really nice place to sit and admire the landscape ) , an antique wooden church , a swimming pool .
There is also quite a big concert hall where , if you are lucky , you can enjoy some interesting concerts ( in general for free ) .
I think it 'll be a perfect place where you can spend some free time .
I can show you around the place and tell you a bit more about the city .
Write back to me as soon as you decide when you want to go to the park . I 'll go with you with pleasure .
when I saw your advertisement , I instantly thought that I would like to work in one of your summer camps .
Since I used to work as a secretary , I feel capable of organizing sports and evening activities , if you choose to let me do so .
Even though cooking is not my favorite chore , I would n't mind working in the kitchens .
After this short description of myself , I would just like to say that I have only heard good things about your summer camps from my relatives in the U.S. , so it would be my pleasure to work for you .
I am writing to you with concern about the U - turns your party have made and your broken promises .
We believe none of the promises your party made have been brought into action .
It was said you would stand up for elderly and ill people but nothing has changed .
Security against terrorist attacks was promised to be stepped up , but policemen are not seen in the streets and neither are security cameras .
People were counting on this party to increase public expenditure , but pensions have stayed the same .
One of the most disappointing things is that you played down the situation we are living in and the needs people have .
We were told this party would speak out against corruption , but now it is your own policy , and promises seem like they were a bad joke .
We hope this letter will make you back down and apologize to the ones that vote for your lies .
People are noticing your promises are not going to be kept and I am sure there will be plenty of people complaining about the lack of truth in your promises .
Therefore , the first chapter features Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott , a high - flying counter - terrorism officer , who is recruited to AC-12 after refusing to collude with his colleagues in the cover - up of a failed operation in which a man was mistakenly shot by another cop .
He 's one of AC-12 's leading investigators although he sometimes has the tendency to let his personal feelings sway his professional judgement .
Fleming plays his partner 's role , an AC-12 undercover specialist , who prides herself on being the consummate professional , unmoved by emotional considerations .
Both of them share a superior , Hastings , who remains the ethically upstanding senior investigating officer ; zealous and suspicious , not being everyone 's cup of tea .
Even though widely recognised for his impeccable ethical standards , he hides a drastic change in his personal circumstances .
With calculated precision , the plot hatches a story where there are no goodies and baddies , and throws in a few twists and turns that make your jaw drop -indeed , Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates has adopted a set of particular ethical principles and , nevertheless , he 's adored by his loyal team , has got a nice family and has recently been awarded " Officer of the Year " .
To conclude , those who ultimately felt miserable after the end of the spellbinding second season need not worry ; Line of Duty writer Jed Mercurio has been commissioned by the BBC to write the third and fourth series , and if you haven't tried it before , you 've just about got time to catch up .
If you were a UK tourist coming to Switzerland for a short weekend break fifteen years ago , you would have found yourself in a situation where no shops had Sunday opening hours .
I clearly remember bringing milk and bread over from Heathrow on Sunday mornings !
Now you can shop on Sundays although your shopping spree will still be limited to Zurich railway station and the airport , not to mention some limited choice of simple foods at occasional motorway services .
But it is an improvement , to say the least !
Although the size of the average supermarket in Switzerland will still remind you of a medium - sized village shop , there has been improvement there as well !
We can now see international brands we are used to in the UK .
But the prices will shock and surprise you , they are double or triple the UK ones .
If you have strong nerves , do your window shopping in Bahnhofstrasse in Zürich .
You can find the same stuff in Italy for half the price !
Sarah was not exactly the coolest girl in the school but she came anyways , thinking that maybe for once she would be accepted in their group . But no one was to be seen behind that window .
Sarah could never have imagined that the sneaky boys were hidden inside the abandoned house waiting for her entrance with eggs and tomatoes in their hands , ready to smash them into her face .
She was just about to open the door to check the inside when , suddenly , a scream echoed from the house , the door slammed open and the group started running at full speed , chased by four big spiders who had just discovered that their home had just been occupied .
I guess what goes around comes around !
" she shouted to them with a smile on her face . With this story to tell she will finally shut those boys ' mouths at school .
Usually he was energetic , full of confidence , ready to party .
But she had no intention of giving up .
She had fought too hard for this life and she would not let their long - standing relationship be ruined just like that .
By accident , he thought .
An accident which had been well prepared by her .
He was not stupid , but you could not expect any pearls of wisdom from him .
He had never worked , but they had been living in a 40-room house with a huge garden and so many servants that she could not remember their names .
They had never worried about money - all bills were paid by his trust fund .
" Have you got a mistress?",she asked one morning when they were having breakfast .
" How could you even say that ? I would never ever do that to you . "
At that moment he was like a bear with a sore head .
She wanted answers and to have them he needed to be alive not dead of a heart attack .
" What is going on then ? And do not lie to me ! You have always been a very bad liar ! "
" We are broke .
Every morning I go to the port and unload ships .
Nobody there knows me so you should n't be afraid that some of our friends will recognise me .
Nobody will ever know that we are poor now " .
This must be some kind of joke .
" We can move to smaller house or fire some of the servants ? "
And where would I put my wine collection ? I would rather work as a porter than live in a 20-room house " .
They definitely had different ideas of poverty .
But before clarifying that , she wanted to ask one more important question :
Ever since he was a little boy , people around him had known that this child had a strange character .
He was really moody and he could go from extreme happiness to the most absolute sadness in a few seconds .
When he grew up he struggled to overcome his illness and he became a sane , strong , handsome young adult man .
However , all the people in his neighbourhood feared him because of his past .
Therefore , he decided that he was going to meet new people to begin a new life .
At the age of twenty years , he got a job as a personal trainer where he earned enough money to rent a flat .
In this way , he moved to his new neighbourhood where everybody respected him .
One day , he fell in love with one of his female customers .
She was a beautiful , tall , blond , Polish girl called Magda who worked as an architect in a studio in the center of London .
Their relationship had been excellent since the first time that they had met each other and two months later they decided to become lovers .
Slowly he became ill one more time .
Although he had been trying to hide this , his personal problems were obvious and Magda did n't feel happy with him .
Finally , their relationship broke up and Michael fell deeper into his illness than ever .
Three months later , Magda was walking with her new boyfriend and Michael saw them . He was totally insane and jealous . He grabbed an enormous stick from the nearest tree and he beat them as hard as he could .
The young couple of lovers fell on the floor and Michael ran away to his home .
His insane evil mind did n't go away until he reached his flat .
At that moment , everything changed , he remembered his childhood , his recovery and his sane life . Then Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
In my opinion , public transport is doomed , because travelling by car is much more convenient and at the same time the easiest way to reach any destination you wish to get to .
People have to sit next to other people they do n't know for a long time . In other words , you may be sitting next to suspicious passengers .
On the other hand , travelling by car allows you to establish your own pace , even when you travel to a place you do not know so well .
This means you can set the time you want to leave , because you do not have to respect a specific timetable .
This way you will have the chance to have a more relaxing journey through the countryside , traffic will not be so intense and aggressive , and finally , you can plan the time you want to arrive , using a GPS or other technology to help you plan your journey .
To sum up , travelling by public transport can be advantageous when you travel inside a town , but when you have to travel outside your specific territory , nothing is better than a car .
Michael had been working very hard , and just seemed to really be overwhelmed by all the work he had been carrying out over the course of the month .
Well , on this particular morning , Michael seemed to be getting along quite well , he appeared to be energetic and very vibrant that particular morning .
His attention to detail appeared to be trustworthy and correct , and normally his attention to detail is not something that is challenged , because of how reliable he is .
Well , as the day was coming to a close , Michael had a distinct feeling that something just was n't correct but he dismissed that feeling and continued with his day as he usually does .
Well , the day 's responsibilities , in Michael 's mind , had been successfully accomplished and he felt really confident about all he had accomplished .
Needless to say , Michael could n't have been any more deceived than he had realized , because the unfortunate thing is that when he was doing his walk - through in all of his department the inventory that was supposed to be submitted was in fact inaccurate .
Because , after , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
You sounded really stressed in your last email and I am worried about that .
Are things better today ?
I know you are under a lot of pressure because of your final exams and I can really understand how you are feeling right now , buried in a mountain of books and notes , with no free time for other things or just to relax .
I 've been through all these things .
Do n't you remember how you cheered me up when things could n't get any worse ?
Nothing is worth getting stressed out about .
If you can study in short bursts and take some breaks , you 'll be more efficient by far in your studies than slogging away for hours on end .
Think about it !
Another thing that helped me a lot was doing sports regularly near home .
Jogging or going out for a walk helped me to boost my energy levels and to clear my mind .
I think it 's very useful - and right now I sound like your Mom - to eat properly .
Try to eat fresh food , such as salads , tons of fruit , and you 'll feel better .
Take care and do n't let it get you down !
Considering all this , nowadays it is socially important to develop positive values among young people , such as respect and tolerance , to create honest adult people .
The 21st century has given a new meaning to the word friendship .
From what evolved as a comradeship between 2 people based on acquaintance , mutual interest and companionship , it has moved forth to relationships where people have not even met one another physically .
In the past , friends were made when people met each other , other than , of course , pen friends .
Today , with technology , friends are made at the click of a key , be it on social media or mobile devices .
Today , with the BFF concept , one has a best friend in every nook and cranny for different purposes .
Friendship stood the test of time and grew stronger with disagreements , fights and misunderstanding , all being resolved and forgotten in the name of friendship .
Today , friendships are take take take and very few stand the test of time .
Friendship today is a friend or friends for each season and reason , while the friendship of the past was whatever the situation or time a friend stands through .
However , this does n't mean that my parents , especially when I was a child , always told me " yes " and let me do whatever I wanted to .
On the contrary , I grew up with many " no " s , and I do not always agree with them in different situations .
But they taught me all the important values and good manners , and I 'm grateful to them for that .
Because nowadays I see around me kids who are pleased in every way by their parents : they buy them whatever they want , and behave like " friends " .
I believe that this is wrong , because by doing so they 're not doing their job well .
This does n't mean that parents should keep themselves distant from their children ; on the contrary , a child should talk to their family , asking for advice or just to confront each other , because communication is at the basis of relationships of every kind .
I just think that each of us in our life plays a role , and that being parents is not an easy job , but they should try to do their best .
The Miracle Resort , Bangkok
The Miracle is an extraordinarily large resort .
Counting 33 stories in the main building , it could be the biggest resort in Bangkok .
The resort mainly focuses on children , which is , in my eyes , a good idea .
The focus on children can be found in the huge contribution the Kids Club makes to the daily life in the hotel .
You can find Kids Club 's members everywhere in the hotel , except for your room .
The hotel handles privacy very well and I guess most of the guests will appreciate it .
A more compact building would be more appreciated by most people .
Finding a new job has become a tough task for all people who have just finished their studies .
Our plan is to go to Birmingham with my cousin Daniel who has been living there for 3 years and to stay with him just the time we need until we can find a job and a place to spend three months because we must return in October .
I think that it would be quite easy for Montse to find a job , but I am quite worried about my opportunities .
If I am lucky , I would apply for an interesting job , but I think that I will apply for a normal job such as barman , working in a factory , etc .
I hope that this adventure goes well , because we are very excited and it would be useful in order to find a job when we come back to Spain .
You can tell because everybody looks at her like she is some crazy murdering kid .
Most of the students at Laura 's new school do not talk to her . They are a little bit too cautious about interacting with her .
Frustrated , Laura accepted her new life of solitude outside of the secret society of others .
And she thought that this was her chance to get in , to be one of them .
He had not spoken one word to Laura , but she followed him around since the incident .
One day , when she followed him home she said : Okay , I give up !
If nobody talks to me , then none of you have the right to judge me .
I do n't want to be a part of your life , because if you act like that without knowing me , then you do not deserve my attention .
He thought that this was very brave , but he did n't have enough confidence to tell her that .
This TV series is presented by Netflix , an online service that allows its subscribers to view any TV Show , anywhere , and on any device .
The series provides an unorthodox insight into the lives of eight people that are connected by some sort of magical spirit .
This connection allows them to see through each others ' eyes , and even control each others ' movements .
This decision made the series extraordinary , with scenes filmed in Seoul , Nairobi , San Francisco , Mumbai , London , Berlin , Mexico and Chicago .
To sum up , I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in science - fiction , but also to anyone curious about different cultures as " Sense8 " provides an unseen view into the lives of eight very different characters , their surroundings , religions , and traditions .
To be honest , in the questionnaire you sent , I could give a positive response to most of the questions but I do n't consider myself a code expert .
In JavaScript I have some experience but not of the necessary quality that is required for such a position , I think .
Like I told you , I 'm a web graphic designer , among other things , focused more on design and my use of code is very limited .
If I have to , I search the web for information and implement it but it requires time .
Perhaps there is some chance of acquiring knowledge during the development of the activity .
About my CV you have . It is up to date and you can keep it . Maybe you have some new offer that matches better with my profile .
The Food Network has become my favourite channel . I can watch it the whole day !
It 's so relaxing and very informative . I never get bored .
Cooking shows are fun to watch , but my favourite shows are those about cakes and pastries .
I really enjoy baking and I often buy books about it .
Cheesecake , for me , is the simplest yet most sophisticated cake there is .
Recently , I spent a week in Switzerland as a part of a students ' exchange programme .
I stayed with a local family , which happened to be the family of the person that stayed with me when he took part in the same programme .
His name is John , and like me he is doing a degree in Physics Engineering in the hope that someday he can work at a research center , such as CERNE , conveniently located a few miles away from his house .
I strongly recommend that the programme organisers should make interest - free loans available to people wishing to participate in an exchange .
Before addressing the question of what is better for young people , I would like to remind you that both activities ( spending time on a computer and watching television ) are harmful for children's / teens ' health .
On the other hand , it 's impossible to imagine our life without computers and television .
With the help of computers , young people can meet new friends , find out a lot of information , take part in forums and discussions .
There are plenty of free sites with content that is far from moral ; many computer games involve cruelty .
And the idea that , by spending time on Internet chats , young people develop their social skills , is problematic .
I wish it were so !
But getting used to the Internet 's rules of communication , they might find it difficult to face up to reality , and make friends in the real world .
But when I want to relax I 'd rather watch TV with my friends than fritter away time sitting alone in front of the computer !
This restaurant was recommended to me by my aunt who was working just around the corner from this restaurant a few years ago .
It has a unique modern - rustic interior design suitable for any occasion , be it a birthday party , family gathering or even a date with your loved one .
From my experience , I feel that the food served in this restaurant is of fine quality , not to mention how delicious the food is .
Not only that , I was spoilt for choice as I flipped through the menu as there was a huge variety of southeast Asian food that ranged from Thai food , Indonesian food , Chinese food and the list goes on .
The food on the menu was amazingly not for illustration purposes only as the food they served looked exactly like the food on the menu .
I think this is the most suitable restaurant for this special occasion as everyone would have a wide variety of food to choose from and just let the view of the city enhance the night .
So , as the end of term is getting closer and closer , many students are becoming stressed out and it is certainly not different for me .
But if you know how to deal with your anxiety during the exam period , you can take the success of passing exams for granted .
That is one of the most reliable ways to make sure you will manage things on time without any unnecessary stress .
Place it in the most visible and strategic place in your room and stick to it .
Without mind and body regeneration , you will not be able to learn as fast and as effectively as you would after a good rest .
To kick off your day , give your body enough energy in the form of proteins .
Also , to activate your brain quicker , go out for some fresh air .
Mark and leave the most difficult ones until the end .
I remember when I was a kid the only thing I used the phone for was to call my friends to play on the street .
The telephone was a convenience , something used to help people communicate , to make their lives easier .
The Internet changed people 's routine .
Despite the large number of advantages that the Internet and phones give us , the use of technology affects people 's ability to communicate face to face .
We just take turns talking ( chatting is maybe more correct to say ) and most of the time without any aim .
Using messages , people forget to use grammar or even form full sentences .
The worst thing is that people do n't know how to talk to each other , how to make conversation with new people or even with old friends .
Nowadays , communication face to face is something rare and , most of the time , accidental .
People just take turns talking without putting in any purpose or feelings .
Thank you for your enquiry and your interest in coming here .
There are n't many guidebooks about my city so I will recommend you a place worth seeing .
In the centre of the park there is a shaft which is . The shaft is beautifully illuminated at night .
There is also a building which can be considered an interactive museum .
In a very interesting way you can find out something about the history of Siemianowice and about mines .
There are a lot of old photos compared with new ones .
What impresses me the most is the combination of old elements of the building with glass and bricks .
In that building you can also find a small cinema .
During summer , the park organizes many exhibitions and cultural events .
Silesian culture offers a lot , so I think you will have fun visiting The Park of Tradition .
Basketball - the best sport ever !
It 's a team sport where you have to start and stop like in aerobics .
It burns lots of calories , builds endurance and builds up muscles .
80% of the game is mental : you have to think about what move you should make next and what the rest of the team is up to .
As well as being a great way to stay fit , basketball can help you to make new friends and make you a good team player .
Basketball can be played and enjoyed with as few as two people , even if the official games of basketball require 10 people .
The beauty of this sport is that , as long as you have a ball , you can spend hours dribbling or shooting on your own .
After years of contemplating between staying with Marianne - who was more or less the joy of his parents ' life - not him , Marianne - for life , or leaving and starting afresh , he had finally chosen the latter , thinking that it was the right decision to make at that moment .
But now , every second that passed after that monumental moment just made him feel worse and worse about himself , having second thoughts about whether he should have stayed with Marianne or not .
He sighed as he sat down on the big empty couch and remembered all the memories he shared with Marianne .
He had taken her out to a five - star restaurant , which she insisted was too much , which got Michael to insist that it was okay .
A few weeks later saw the occasion of their first fight .
Michael had an unexpected late meeting at work that night and forgot to call home , which made Marianne completely furious ; throwing things at the wall , crashing plates from the counter to the ground , the whole nine yards .
Nowadays , the healthy habits of young people are very different than in the nineties .
And we need to know the reason for these changes and what we can do to improve them .
Firstly , it is true that young people used to do sports daily anywhere , at school or in the street , and also they did n't use to eat fast food .
Secondly , many people argue that society has experienced great changes in family life .
Although they want the best for their children , sometimes it is difficult because they are tired and they tend to prepare junk food and allow them to spend their time on the internet or playing with video games .
In my opinion , parents should be concerned about their family 's comfort and should motivate their children to do sport , be in contact with a lot of people and avoid eating fast food .
The wind was freezing cold , and now he had to walk to the office , which was a 25-minute walk away .
You missed your flight and it was a business trip ! You 're going to get fired ! " ,
he said to himself as he whimpered .
I 'm going to talk about Doctor Who , a British sci - fi TV show about an alien called the Doctor who travels through time and space in a police box called the TARDIS ( Time and Relative Dimension in Space ) .
The first episode aired in 1963 and , since then , Doctor Who has been one of the most famous sci - fi TV shows on television .
Since the TV show aired the character of the Doctor has been played by 12 actors , the newest one was announced in the summer last year , which is when I was visiting London with my family .
It really caught my attention how relevant Doctor Who is in the UK because almost every time I turned on the TV there was someone talking about who could be the new Doctor . It appeared on the news , in newspapers and on the day the BBC was going to reveal the name of the actor they even made a special show about it .
Since I was in London , I thought I would visit The Who Shop . It is a shop dedicated to Doctor Who and it has a museum with costumes and other things that have appeared in the TV show .
We did n't have much time to go there because it was far from our hotel so I had to go with my father while the rest of my family was somewhere else .
If we had stayed more time , we would have been able to spend more time at the shop , but anyway , I loved going there and meeting other people who also liked Doctor Who and I bought some merchandise from the shop .
When the BBC finally announced who was going to play the 12th Doctor , many fans got upset about their choice because they thought the new actor was too old and they said they did n't like it .
But , hopefully , not everyone was like that .
When an important TV show goes through such a big change not everybody likes it , that is why the same thing happened when the BBC announced who would be playing the 11th Doctor .
Nobody liked him at first , but now that he is leaving everybody loves him and wants him to stay .
Actually , I 'm one of those fans who are sad about the 11th Doctor leaving because he is my favourite one , as he was the one I experienced Doctor Who with , because I started watching the TV show when he was playing the main role .
Anyway , before the BBC had announced who was going to play the Doctor 's role , the fans had started making speculations about who could act as him .
Some said that he would be played by other famous British actors , but others thought that an actress should play the new role .
Thanks to it , I have met a lot of people who share the same interests as I do and I have discovered some of my favourite TV shows .
I like Doctor Who because time travel has always caught my attention . Also , I like it because the plot is incredible . Something that happened in season one can be connected with some of the later episodes .
As I am studying physical education , I have a lot of experience of looking after children .
Last year , a group of little kids came to university and we had to teach them several games and outdoor activities - thanks to this project , I am able to organise entertaining sports and activities .
I have just completed a 5-year course in English and I got very good marks .
I am sure I am the right person for the job - because I have patience with children . I know what they enjoy doing , and my cooking skills are very useful too .
I 'm OK .
I 'm OK .
She read it at least twenty times , then threw it away and prepared her soul for their father 's arrival .
Most , if not all , of the inhabitants of this planet would answer ' yes ' .
Last century provided us with countless opportunities to be more mobile .
We , humans , can say that we live on the planet Earth without being metaphorical for the first time in all our history .
The world of the first half of the XIXth century was quite different from that .
Of course , most westerners were already able to imagine the globe with relative accuracy , but the picture in their minds differed from the one in ours .
It had the same shades as medieval maps that pictured dragons guarding an earthly paradise somewhere near the shore of India .
By ' shades ' I mean not real colors , but those undertones that our mind imparts to everything it comes into contact with .
- Nelson Mandela . I believe that education is important and it is able to bring about enormous changes to an individual .
When I was a kid , I started to think about being a teacher .
That 's why I have always been making an effort to enhance my knowledge and experiences to be a teacher in my future career .
Since I was in F.5 , when I became capable of teaching somebody , I started to be a Korean teacher and a private English tutor .
Apart from that , it has been good practice for speaking .
As a teacher , I have to talk in front of many students and that helped me to become a better speaker .
In order to enhance my knowledge , I tried to grab the chance to raise my English level .
In 2014 , I completed the ' Let 's Debate ' writing program offered by The Standard and wrote a total of 4 articles for the ' Let 's Debate ' column of The Standard Student and Junior Standard .
It was a truly valuable program for me and it improved my English .
Moreover , I also participated in the Standard Chartered Hong Kong English Public Speaking Contest in 2015 .
These experiences were tremendously memorable for me and it was an honor to take part in these events .
Apart from that , as I believe that languages are the basic channel of communication between people , I have studied several foreign languages to equip myself .
Other than Korean , I have also been learning Japanese and Spanish , starting from F5 .
Not only can foreign languages become a huge advantage to me , they can also bring me satisfaction and gratification .
I would also like to further my studies of various foreign languages at university .
Therefore , I have always wanted to be offered the chance to take an English and education related program in my tertiary education so as to fulfill my dream and to accomplish my life goal .
In the first place , it seems to me that it is really important , both for children and parents to communicate in order to organize their lives , taking into account the changing schedules .
Using the phone during breaks lets the students focus on the lesson and then , have a bit of distraction when they are not there and , what is more , keep parents relaxed because they can communicate with their children and talk about what they need .
That is why I totally agree with Richardson 's modality dealing with this important issue which is present in students ' , schools ' and parents ' lives nowadays .
Secondly , I would like to mention that I agree with the experiment that is taking place in some districts permitting students to use their mobile phones for educational purposes , and what is more , with Richardson 's facing this issue .
Technology is one of the most important parts of our lives , so we should incorporate it into our habits .
However , teachers run the risk of losing their responsibility there , and students can lose their educational way looking on the phones as a means of entertainment instead of as a way to make education enjoyable and effective , as you say in one of your paragraphs : " The Richardson decision is a sound alternative to students secretively using their phones under their desk " .
I consider that something should be done in order to balance the pros and cons of having mobile phones present in schools , because , firstly , students are the ones who must be present and , what is more , their learning process also must be there .
Apart from that , I strongly believe that technology can be incorporated into the classroom , but teachers and schools are the ones who have to control this activity so that it can be positive both for students and teachers , in order to make the learning process more motivating and effective .
Technology and , mostly , mobile phones , are part of children 's and parents ' lives , so schools should n't ban it , but look for alternatives in order that they do n't have a negative effect in education .
Richardson 's methodology is fantastic and I think that there are more , and it is important that we know them , in order to be informed about this important issue .
First , to have a successful campaign , it is important to know the target market .
After studying our advertising options , it was found that two of them could be suitable for our purpose .
On the other hand , we could set up stands in shopping malls .
In order to obtain maximum benefit from this , it will be helpful if we give away product samples .
As I mentioned above , the advertising campaign must be appropriate to the target market .
I therefore feel justified in recommending that the campaign in shopping malls would be more effective for us .
This is mainly because , besides it being cheaper , customers will become familiar with the product .
If we choose the appropriate kind of advertising for our product , I can assure you that we will succeed .
Twenty years ago the economic situation was better than the current situation , so people did n't have to work until late and they managed to provide a strict education and to care about their children 's health .
Now things have changed : parents work full time and do not take up a lot of their children who are more and more alone and unsupervised .
When the home is empty , teenagers feel free to spend all the time lying on the couch , playing video games or watching awful programmes on TV .
At the same time , they gorge themselves with every kind of food they find in the refrigerator .
A sedentary lifestyle and a poor diet lead , of course , to obesity .
This is a common issue . In fact , juvenile obesity is increasing with bad consequences such as premature diabetes or a permanent disease .
For those people who want to combine fun and health , a good solution could be running , which is a free , competitive and complete sport .
In Milan , the association Runners from Mars welcomes thousands of runners who compete for charity .
It would be a good way to change the lifestyle !
I normally dream but do n't remember when I wake up .
One day I dreamt that I was a millionaire . I bought a huge detached house surrounded by tall trees in a beautiful city , maybe in a city like Seville .
Upstairs , there would be a games room where I could play with my nephews , nieces and my daughter , another bathroom , a little office to work and to study English , and finally , a huge room called " the cinema - room " , with several comfortable seats and a giant screen where my friends and I could watch our favourite films .
First of all , I would like to thank you for offering to look after my house and my pet bird while we go on holiday .
This means a lot to me . You are a wonderful friend .
We are leaving very late at night , but I managed to leave a copy of the key at the reception of the building . You should keep it with you .
I know the only time you have to go there is in the morning , before you go to work , so I would like to ask you to give priority to changing the water for my bird , and seeing if there are still enough seeds in her bowl which , by the way , are in a box next to the cage .
I also left yoghurt and frozen food for you to prepare in the oven or microwave . This way , you wo n't have to worry about going back home to have lunch before going to work .
We will be back by the end of the week , so take care and enjoy your mornings with my bright bird . She loves having company , so if you could get her to have lunch with you and talk a little with her , she will be happy for the rest of the day .
I ca n't wait to be with her again . I do n't like leaving her for a long time .
Three years ago , I worked as a Spanish teacher in an Australian boarding school .
At the weekends , I carried out a workshop on leisure activities for children in need .
With the passing of time , the entire world has become one concrete jungle .
The human race began from the jungle , where they lived with the worries and fears of wild beasts and under the illusionary protection of tall trees , and now the journey of the human race has come to the same scenario , where once again , he is living with the fears of wild beasts called ' other humans ' and under the ' illusionary protection ' of stalwart buildings that may collapse either due to an earthquake or to a terrorist attack .
This is why , although we have the luxury of extravagant knowledge at out fingertips because of the Internet , we encounter complications and complexities in the decoding of our relationships and in deciphering this perennial flow of knowledge .
The religion of Scientology is known as one of the fastest growing religions in the world .
Interestingly , Scientology practitioners use technology to prove their hypothetical statements , for they have constructed machines that exhibit the workings of brains through waves and software that questions a practitioner and provides him with a solution to his worries .
In contrast to this , the religions that have survived since the earlier times had discreet knowledge . However , they had a much deeper impact .
Scientology proves how the acquisition of widespread knowledge hasn't stopped the birth of new religions . However , ironically , it has made the philosophies of life more dramatic with the mysterious complexities of technology .
Likewise , there are many conspiracy theorists in the world who , time and again , circulate rumours regarding the existence of a secret organisation ( the Illuminati , for instance ) that runs the world secretly and plots all the pre - timed wars and terrorist - attacks .
The theorists assert that the organisation is part religious and part political ; it rules over the international media , thereby being omnipotent .
They present complex information so smartly that an ignorant fool feels like a sagacious monk , whence he becomes the follower and a voter .
Thus , by all means , today we have an easy accessibility to knowledge and we have a wide range of resources to locate and obtain endless information .
Nevertheless , there is a stomach - wrenching mystery and indecipherable codes around that sometimes makes the common man wonder about his vulnerable existence and unknowingly being - exploited life .
I choose option A : I think it is a good idea for children to travel on public transport .
First , it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses , because , by Grade 5 , children are able to take care of themselves and each other .
In other words , if parents spoil their offspring , then they may become too dependent and incapable of functioning well in society later on .
I think this way can help them with adapting to society early .
I am a forty - year - old secondary school teacher of Art and I believe I have qualifications that you may be looking for . I have been teaching students for approximately 15 years .
I used to run summer camps and art workshops .
Working with groups of people fills me with lots of energy and , as they need me , I need them too .
I have been studying English for several years and I am preparing to take the FCE exam soon .
I enjoy participating in debates .
I would describe myself as a good listener and a fluent speaker with a strong ability to control discussion .
Apart from an ability to get on well with people , I read a lot .
If you would like to take my application further , then I would be pleased to hear from you .
The aim of this proposal is to compare the two proposed venues , River Boat Disco and Milford Comedy Club , and to recommend one based on the survey carried out among the students .
Not only does River Boat Disco have its own experienced DJ , but it also has a buffet which is more than suitable for this occasion .
However , the main disadvantage of the disco is that it ends very early , at 10:30 pm , whereas the comedy club is open until 2 am .
The price for the disco is very reasonable because it offers the venue , entertainment and food for $ 25 .
Even though the price is $ 5 less for the comedy club , it is without food and , by the end of the night , I do not think there would be much difference .
However , the comedy club is easy to find and is accessible by metro and taxi .
I would recommend the River Boat Disco because not only does it offer a buffet , but also , people are more likely to converse with each other while listening to music than to a comedian .
There is a great variety of dishes , from starters to main dishes and desserts . My recommendation is garlic bread as a starter .
This restaurant is very affordable . The prices are extremely reasonable , especially if you 're a student , because there 's a special menu called " student 's menu " where you choose two ingredients for your pizza , with or without French fries , and a drink for about three euros .
Everyone on the staff is extremely nice and very often the owners come to make small talk with the customers .
All in all , I think this would be the best restaurant for our class to go to , since it 's close to the school , it has good prices and a friendly ambience .
Also , everyone enjoys Italian food , so everyone would be pleased .
Dreaming about the future is like creating an imaginary world , perfect for yourself and others .
If the present does n't satisfy you , let 's take a trip into the future .
The year 2064 .
People are living their lives in a way that we would consider more than shocking .
Everyone is living their perfectly " normal " lives in the sky .
You 've read it right .
Because of the lack of space , people came up with the brilliant idea of creating these floating houses . They are made of a special type of glass and have a spherical shape .
As a result of finding this solution , they have more space to work on earth and they even protect the environment .
When it comes to their jobs , people work on earth , like in the old days .
They have cars , not like the cars people from 2014 were used to , but they still call them that .
Once the button is pushed , the car finds the driver and literally picks him up .
Overall , this is an image of the future .
Now let 's return to the present , because we have a lot of work to do if we want to live in that kind of future , eventually .
In 2012 , I got the Cambridge first certificate in English and I 've been improving my French to pass the exam .
It 's six months since I started teaching gymnastics in a primary school near Milan and I discovered that children are more competitive and honest than adults and I appreciate this .
I always try to motivate them with some educational play and I make them understand how important the group is .
The school will be closed in Summer , so I 'll be available from the 15th of June to the 30th of September .
For references , you can contact the principal of the school , who will be happy to supply you with any information .
Taking a gap - year before starting university is a lifetime opportunity for lots of people .
It 's a time to develop yourself , to travel , to make friends .
You can also spend that time working and saving money for future years on the university campus .
You will definitely part ways during college and this way you can make memories that will last for a lifetime .
You only live once and wasting such a great possibility is unthinkable .
From booking a flight to videocalling a distant friend , everything seems very handy nowadays .
However , the main drawback of such progress is that we now rely more on computers than on our own capacities .
We are slowly but inexorably loosing readiness to solve problems , unless we can surf the Internet , so that even a single day without technology would turn out to be a nightmare .
How many times in the last ten years have we given up GPS and used an ordinary paper map for a trip ?
The reality is that the fast - paced world we are currently living in is stealing our own time .
In my view , we should all reconsider the role that computers have gained in our lives .
It was the last year I was attending high school and final exams were approaching faster than I had thought .
Suddenly a plethora of concerns filled my head : what to do after school ?
And finally , as with everything , the day arrived .
Then , when it was finally my turn , I sat in front of the teachers and , slowly , I introduced my speech .
Fifteen minutes later it was all over and I felt like a brand new person .
After this event I can cope with anything !
As was said before , the brief time of observation does not allow us to obtain that much information about how CLIL is really implemented in a particular educational context . Even so , the data collected and the following conversation with the teacher , contributed to obtaining an interesting picture of how Arts and Crafts is considered and carried out under the CLIL umbrella .
CLIL implementation is always a challenge for the teacher , but it seems to be even more difficult when talking about subjects like Arts and Crafts , which are more based on the acquisition of skills and the development of another language , the artistic .
How to provide students with more real and relevant input , in the daily routine of an art class , seems to be a challenge for Arts and Crafts teachers , who need to bring together the development of the artistic language and the learning of a foreign language .
It is interesting to see how the students resort to each other when looking for help in a natural way , without the intervention of the teacher .
Peer support is something that teachers expect and promote in all subjects , but it seems to emerge more genuinely when talking about the CLIL atmosphere .
I am writing to express my interest in the bar staff opening you have posted on our school 's noticeboard .
First of all , I strongly believe that I would be the most suitable applicant because of my long experience in bar service .
For the last six years , I have worked in a number of different bars within the busy city district region .
I know what is involved in late night customer service and how to deal with a loud environment .
All of the bars I worked in hosted a night club after 10 PM , therefore you do not need to worry about extra tiredness caused by late - hour working .
In addition , my knowledge acquired by managing a bar and a certificate in hygienic food handling will guarantee a clean environment in your bar .
Finally , I would like to emphasise my professionalism towards alcohol service .
I am a bartender who has been awarded three times in international bar - show contests .
The time allocations you have suggested in the job advertisement also suit my schedule perfectly .
Furthermore , some learners respond better to an explicit focus on rules , which makes them aware of the mistakes they are making .
I fully believe that this combined method is the most effective way for students to learn English .
Now we are going to evaluate the main characteristics and differences between a pellet stove and a pellet boiler .
Let 's start by focussing our attention on the pellet stove .
The diagram shows a compact structure and the simplicity of the machine ; it has three main sections : the feed section , the combustion chamber and the blower ( i.e .
In the first conical part , it is possible to feed in the fuel ( i.e. the pellet ) that leads to the combustion chamber where the pellet will burn to generate the heat necessary to warm up the air .
As mentioned above , the heat is necessary to warm up the air that , thanks to the fan , will be blown out to the room in order to warm up the external ambient ( e.g. room , bathroom , kitchen ... ) .
This is a pretty compact machine , but it 's not very efficient or very clean .
Actually , it produces a large amount of pollution such as ash and exhaust gas that contains micro- and nano - particle .
The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove . The difference is that , instead of a fan , here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house , so it needs a pump to do that instead of just a fan ( the purpose of a fan and a pump is the same : move fluid from a point A to a point B , but in one case , you have to move air and in the second case , water ( they have a different density : water has 1000 times the density of air ) .
Like in the stove , there is a feed section where you can feed the pellet that will go directly to the combustion chamber ( according to the control system ) in order to burn it and generate the heat to warm up the water .
Now , thanks to the pump , the hot water is able to reach the upstairs rooms .
Basically , the two rely on the same methods : burning pellets to warm up a fluid ( air for the stove and water for the boiler ) .
Knowing a clean and tidy city is no less appealing to the tourists than beautiful scenery and bargain shopping , both the authority and the citizens understand the need to keep our city clean in order to keep the tourists coming . Therefore , they are serious about protecting the environment .
To keep the city clean and tidy , people adopt an environmentally - friendly attitude in daily life : they refuse to litter . If they can not find a rubbish bin around , they keep their rubbish in a small plastic bag . At home , they separate the recyclable items from the rubbish before they get rid of the rubbish .
They follow the government 's advice to set the air conditioner temperature at 25 degrees Celsius .
It builds sewage sites for the disposal of the city 's waste .
We are lucky to live in a city where both the authorities and the people have a strong sense of environmental protection .
Among a variety of sports , there is football , also known as soccer .
When I was very young , roughly at the age of thirteen , football became my favorite sport and it was an activity that I could never stop doing .
As time passed , I became more skilled at football .
I signed up for a women 's football team in my city .
We had our own trainer , who was a man who had played football before .
Secondly , it has helped me to improve my health in several ways .
For example , it improves my cardiovascular system .
And thirdly , it is an activity where I have been able to make new friends who , besides playing football like me , are very similar to me in other ways .
As you get involved with football and you engage with this sport , you will clearly notice the benefits it brings to your daily life .
' I think we 're being followed ' said Sara to me , as we pulled over .
Despite the fact that we 'd had to share a table with others tourists , we 'd had a great time .
Sara had left our hire - car keys on the table and had paid no attention to them for a while .
When we were about to leave , we realized that there was a short letter on the table . ' I have your car keys .
Wait for me , please ' , it said .
We 'd been driving for half an hour when I noticed that there was a white car behind us .
We pulled over .
You have the wrong keys and the wrong car ' , said the man .
As soon as the man explained everything to us we realised that we had mixed up car keys in the restaurant because both of them were exactly alike .
We exchanged addresses and as time went on we became good friends .
I ended up working for Mr Smith 's company in Madrid , where I 've been working for 20 years .
People seem to be living quiet , comfortable lives nowadays .
When thinking about what the lives of people will be like in the next 50 years , the first thought that comes to my mind is a person sitting lazily on a sofa that can adjust itself to his / her will .
The reason for the laziness is that the housework will be done by robots .
This is how I think life will be in the next 50 years .
Robots will continue to be improved , till they will be able to do all work in the home , so no one rich enough to afford a robot would bother to do the work himself / herself .
However , not everything about life in the next 50 years will be positive .
Shopping is my favourite pastime , and I simply can not imagine anything more relaxing and enjoyable than spending my hard - earned money .
But , with a heavy heart , I have to agree with this statement .
There might be a few situations , when shopping can bring a headache instead of joy .
The best example here could be the regular , weekly filling - the - fridge shopping , which , in principle , can not be pleasant .
Personally , I am not able to find anything exciting in hanging around extremely high supermarket shelves and pushing a heavy trolley . Crowds in every corner , awful and unpleasant lights and the necessity to run from one end of the shop to another , because these shops are organised in a way which forces you to see everything , in order to find what you really need .
What is more , I hate doing shopping when I really need to buy something .
Because there is this wicked , unwritten rule , according to which , if you are looking for something , there is not the slightest chance you will get it .
Shopping with your husband , boyfriend , father or any representative of the male gender , also can totally ruin the most fruitful shopping ever .
The constant grumbling , regular checking of the time , this anxious and adrift facial expression - how on earth could it create favourable conditions for shopping ? !
And believe me , there is no difference if you are shopping for yourself or for them , it always turns out this way .
In conclusion , shopping can be and usually is a great opportunity , not only to expand the contents of your wardrobe , but also , to relax and have a great time .
You just have to avoid supermarkets and buy clothes in advance - so there will not arise the situation , where you need something really badly and it is not in your closet - and , of course , avoid male company . Better choose a female companion .
I saw your advertisement and would like to apply to work in the USA in one of your summer camps .
Since then , I have attended a course for the preparation for the CAE exam , and spent two weeks in Ireland during the summer working as a babysitter , so I have had experience working with children .
This can be noted in the fact that I was head of entertainment at my High School for two years .
During those two years , I was responsible for the organisation and booking of bands .
I love learning new skills and although I 've never worked in a kitchen before , I 'd love to try my hand at cooking .
I quickly took my things and went out of the classroom hoping to get home as soon as possible .
Ten minutes later , I had already taken my trainers and closed the gym door when I saw her walking towards me .
-"Michie ! Wait for me ! "
I only wanted to tell you that Joe is going to have a party at his house tomorrow at 8 p.m. and I 'll be there " , she said .
-"Thank you for the information . Bye " , I said , knowing what I was n't going to do tomorrow .
Half an hour after I arrived home ,
And Cass , the girl I 'm in love with , slammed the door .
My name is Richard Raya , I am 35 years old and I live in the Basque Country in northern Spain .
in a one - on - one role .
Without knowing it , I have been preparing myself for a position like this one , for example , by working
skills in sports and also a fun - loving attitude towards organising activities .
pastimes . When I cook , it 's usually for a big group of friends , so preparing meals is actually something I
I am available at any time as the summer holidays are upon us .
Do you do any sports ?
If so , you will know all the benefits but also the effort that it takes .
For me it was n't fun at all , so I always tried to skip my classes , and I finally did n't go back the following year .
I think that this is not a normal sport , but it has the same advantages : it burns calories , improves circulation , is good for the bones and muscles ... Therefore , it is a really beautiful way to exercise and helps you to improve flexibility .
My advice for people who would like to start doing ballet is : do n't be afraid , it does n't matter if you are seven or seventy , if you want to do it you can .
Dear Director ,
I would really like to participate as a co - worker in this summer camp .
Whereas , in my opinion , it is way more than that .
By looking after children between the ages of 8 and 12 , I can learn new skills that will be useful in my future with my future kids .
On the one hand , I have never worked in kitchens before .
First , fire , then agriculture , irrigation , and nowadays with technology .
The discovery of electricity increased our productivity greatly .
Instead of just working during the day , man could now continue working during the night .
Then with TVs , information started to spread faster and faster until our contemporary instantaneous reports from across the world in the palm of our hands .
Sometimes , it seems we have reached the pinnacle of existence .
I 'm sure the pharaohs of Egypt felt that way when they gazed at the Pyramids .
Now , we can look at those Pyramids from the other side of the world , receiving a live video feed on a device we hold in our hands .
In the next 50 years , who knows what we will be able to accomplish ?
Education and technology are closely related , to a certain extent , in that education has suffered a series of changes throughout the past 20 years .
In present times , it is very common to see people doing courses via a computer .
Online learning has become a modern phenomenon in order to gain knowledge ; however , face - to - face learning is still the better learning option chosen by students .
Although there are many differences between these two , similarities can be found as well .
Currently , all types of courses exist via the Internet , at any academic or vocational level .
For instance , degree courses , master 's courses or just an updating course can be found .
Added to this , both learning options require time and dedication from students ; otherwise , knowledge will not be properly delivered .
On the other hand , the differences between face - to - face learning and virtual learning are numerous .
Firstly , online learning conveys flexibility in its schedule .
Students can attend courses when they decide , but always respecting due dates .
Another difference between face - to - face learning and online learning may be that face - to - face learning allows students to develop human relationships , whereas with online learning it is quite impossible for this to happen .
During face - to - face learning , students have a teacher - student relationship , as well as a peer - to - peer relationship , allowing them to develop interpersonal skills and coexistence .
Last but not least , time spent on these courses is different too .
When doing a fece - to - face course , besides having an attendance schedule , people spend more time commuting to the place where the course is given .
These days , traffic jams are a fact in big cities ; therefore a lot of time is lost to commuting .
Consequently , both learning options have their positive and negative aspects .
Assessing these similarities and differences , each student has the option to choose the option which better suits his lifestyle .
Peschiera Borromeo , a small town near Milan , has an agricultural reality and there are many possibilities for walking around and training yourself for doing parcour .
Unfortunately , there is a lot of traffic , so the best place to avoid it is a little artificial lake called Idroscalo where people can run around the 7 kilometre perimeter or cycling in the open air while looking at the swans .
In this area , you can find many facilities , such as two swimming pools , a tennis court and a volleyball court .
People can also try canoeing at the local school or water skiing with a mechanical device that drags you across the water .
For those who feel brave , there is also a wall where you can climb with all the equipment .
If you have got a dog , too , and want to teach him something useful , take him here every Sunday morning and a trainer will teach him how to save people from drowning and your friend will become a lifeguard !
In his opinion , the concept of protectionism in the world of global economy is not effective .
There is a good example involving developing countries , whose economies have been successful due to being the most open to free trade , and countries with low economic growth , which closed themselves off to international trade .
Although in the lecture it is admitted that international competition can cause problems for local businesses , mentioned in the article , he claims that it is worth competing with global corporations , because this way surviving local companies may get stronger than ever .
And finally , the article states that free trade does not always lead to a peaceful relationship between nations , but the lecturer draws attention to the European common market set up after World War II .
To test the research 's hypothesis , self - administered questionnaires were used on a total of 400 customers .
The target population included telecommunication service users who subscribed to a loyalty program .
The choice of the telecommunications industry in this framework is related to the vital role of loyalty and retention in this service setting .
This sample size allows us to perform multiple data analyses ( multivariate and SEM ) .
Everyone in this world has their own favorite sports , and so do I. My favorite sport is football .
I often play this with my friends in the evening .
Football is played at a professional level all over the world , and millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favorite team , whilst millions more avidly watch the game on television .
In many parts of the world , football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans , local communities , and even nations ; it is therefore often claimed to be the most popular sport in the world .
I learnt team - building , discipline , as well as teamwork through playing football .
There are many worldwide international football competitions .
One of the major international competitions in football is the World Cup , organized by Fédération Internationale de Football Association .
The next World Cup takes place in Russia in 2018 .
The star I admire most in football is Edson Arantes do Nascimento , nicknamed Pelé , who is a former Brazilian football player and thought by many to be the finest player of all time .
Since his full retirement , he has served as an ambassador for the sport .
There are many reasons why football is my favorite game .
Holidays are mostly about relaxing . Therefore , I disagree with always trying new things .
In my opinion , holidays are essentially about being comfortable , staying in your element and simply enjoying your time off and not about creating uncomfortable situations if that might be the outcome of trying new things .
Change is never easy and being able to try new things is , indeed , a valuable trait for one to have . However , I do not have such traits .
On the contrary , I disagree with having to try new and challenging things on holidays due to the fact that I take much more pleasure in reading novels , which make me feel all the rush of an outside activity but all the while keeping myself safe and comfortable .
The actors are literally amazing .
Their acting is spot on and the costumes are magnificent .
The role of Suleyman is played by Turkey 's most famous actor , Halit Ergenc , and he 's amazing at it .
The actress who plays Suleyman 's wife , Hurrem , is none other than Meryem Uzerli .
There are many languages people in my country learn , but English is the most popular as it is a global language .
Who learns languages in my country ?
Another language of their choice follows at secondary school .
Students at some schools also have the possibility of exchange programmes , but these can be quite expensive and not every family can afford such an event .
Adults usually attend language courses , or use a variety of online courses .
I would recommend the government to increase salaries for Spanish , Italian or French teachers to persuade them to teach in schools instead of giving private lessons .
It would also be wise to fund schools that organise exchange programs for their students , so that more of them could afford it .
example , is there a park or cinema nearby ?
It would be great if all of us had a healthy life .
As a consequence , they become slim and they do n't ingest enough proteins and vitamins to have a healthy life .
On the other hand , teenagers are becoming more dependent on cellphones , video games and television , which make them be more sedentary .
Being always on the bed or on the sofa is not recommended , whereas going outside and running or riding a bicycle would be a better option .
That way , they would be doing physical exercise .
Finally , to be healthy , it is also important to eat a balanced diet .
Snacks , fast food , fried food and sweets are part of young people 's lives as they can find them everywhere : in the shops on the street , at parties and in shopping malls .
Being sedentary and eating fast food will not get them anywhere .
It is easy , fast and we can almost park it right outside our destination or at walking distance - shorter rather than longer .
It is initially expensive , but it is so handy that we end up thinking it is part of us and even think we can not live without it .
Public transport is always going to be slower , less flexible and much less convenient , but we have the reassurance that we are doing what is best for our planet .
We are complying with the norm .
Thus , is it understandable why many feel younger government workers should be incubated before being given promotion to important positions .
In addition to fresh ideas , it should be remembered that to get a government job , one has to successfully a rigorous screening process .
Although the above overview reveals solid evidence for both sides of the argument , it is felt that the healthiest approach to designating government positions is to ensure candidates undergo rigorous training programs .
In order to achieve its objectives , Trivago invested more money in promotion in 2014 .
For example , they promoted their search engine through a television commercial and a Youtube advertisement .
Youtube advertising means the viewers have to be forced to watch the advertisement before they watch some video on Youtube .
Since most people watch television not for just a few minutes or do not just watch one or two video(s ) on Youtube , they will be forced to watch its advertisements more than once .
Trivago has a very simple and memorable tagline , which is ' Hotels ?
The audience will easily think of Trivago when they are thinking about hotels .
Also , Trivago wants to increase its market share by entering the Hong Kong Market .
Many Hong Kongers love to travel and go to different countries to experience the culture and enjoy the different lifestyle .
Many of them try to plan the cheapest way to do their trip including booking the best value hotel .
If they are aware of the benefits of using Trivago , they will love to use it , as they could spend less time comparing all the hotels .
Therefore , Trivago uses advising to increase its market share in Hong Kong .
In addition , Trivago is trying to enhance the company image in Hong Kong .
Trivago is not very well known in Hong Kong .
Some people probably do n't even know what it is .
If Trivago wants to earn profit from the Hong Kong market , it has to develop and enhance its brand image .
Trivago is trying to demonstrate that it is the most convenient hotel search engine on the market .
Last but not the least , Trivago wants to boost its download rate in the mobile application platforms .
Almost all the advertisements are encouraging users to download its mobile application .
If more people download its mobile application , it means more people know its brand and use its service .
We found one of the television advertisements which is currently being broadcast in Hong Kong .
The advertisement is about 16 seconds long .
There is a narrator who introduces the function of Trivago and demonstrates " how to use its mobile application to search for the best value hotel . "
At the end of the video , the screen shows a tagline and the website of Trivago .
Television Commercials
In general , television is the most popular medium in Hong Kong .
Advertising on television is an effective way to communicate a service to the general public .
Since television is able to reach a large number of people during a short period of time , more potential customers will be exposed to its service .
Music helps stimulate the senses and focuses attention on the advertisement .
The background music in the advertisement is relaxed and excite .
It can make people feel youthful and it matches the taste of young adults , who are Trivago 's target customers .
It helps the audience to better recall the advertisement and store it in long - term memory .
The television advertisement shows the service being used .
It demonstrates all the steps from searching for a hotel , choosing selection criteria and comparing the price of different hotels .
Through the demonstration , Trivago can show to the audience how easy it is to use its mobile application to find the best value hotel .
It can enhance its creditability as the audience can clearly know what its service is .
On the other hand , as a mobile application , some people probably feel confused about how it works .
Therefore , with the visual effects , a demonstration is the most effective way to teach the audience to use the mobile application .
The television commercial presents information to the audience in a straightforward way .
For example , he says the application can instantly compare the rates of over 150 websites .
For those who are very interested in hotel searching services , they may notice such an informative advertisement .
It clearly presented that its search engine can help customers to compare the prices of over 150 websites of hotels in the world and find the best value hotel .
This is a testable claim and Trivago can use it as its unique selling proposition .
At the same time , it increases the confidence of customers about choosing its services .
As Hong Kong is a new market for Trivago , it needs to increase its popularity there .
Before 2014 , Trivago was not famous in Asia .
It needs to utilise some strategies to increase its brand awareness and the information about its services for its customers in order to achieve the promotional objectives .
In the television commercial , the narrator tells the audiences to download the Trivago mobile application to their mobile phone .
It encourages customers to purchase its services and truly make use of it .
The purpose is to increase sales and increase its market share in Hong Kong .
Moreover , the " Means - End Chain " is adapted in the television advertisement .
By using Trivago 's services , customers can search for the most economical price of hotel room to gain benefit .
Trivago can achieve personal value for customers through the advertisement .
Some people desire to have a comfortable and pleasant journey with lower prices and the freedom of choose their favorite accommodation .
The advertisement can show that they are wise by using Trivogo 's service to plan an economical trip .
Mean - End Chain is being used , as Trivago is not only to help customers search for a hotel room , but also to achieve personal value for customers , which is more valuable than the money the customer saved on booking a hotel room .
Trivago uses this method to enhance its brand image and competitive advantage , since the value of its services is increased .
Audiences can easily remember the brand name and get a clear awareness and knowledge of Trivago services .
Trivago does not choose radio to be their medium , as it is antiquated .
Attention to radio commercials is low .
Also , radio advertisements only contain verbal effects .
Even though people listen to the radio advertisement of Trivago , they probably do not know how to spell the word ' Trivago ' as it is not a normal word .
It makes it hard for people to search for Trivago on the Internet .
Therefore , the product awareness driven by a radio advertisement is not enough .
Newspaper is also not a good medium , since newspapers have recently been replaced by online newspapers .
Likewise , Trivago is an online service , so a newspaper advertisement may not be appropriate for it .
Lastly , hiring a spokesperson entails high costs in promotion .
And there is a risk in hiring a spokesperson , as he may not bring an expected return for the company .
Sometimes , if there is a spokesperson in an advertisement , the audience 's focus may shift from the product to the spokesperson .
The promotional objective is difficult to achieve .
Therefore , a television commercial is likely to be the most suitable method to promote its brand in Hong Kong .
Not even a month before , he had paid a fortune to get his place refurbished and painted .
He headed for the front door in a rage .
Jacob remained there bursting with rage .
While he was standing on the pavement , tears of resentment covered his face .
Have you ever watched a game that involves people running around a field and scoring goals by kicking a ball ?
I know that for some , playing football is boring , but for me , it 's the most awesome thing ever .
I think I have watched almost all the football matches in history , especially when it was the FIFA World Cup season .
Although I do n't play really well , I would choose it over any other sport , any day .
I feel free when I 'm on the pitch .
90% of our conversation involves football and we can talk all day about it for sure .
Here is some advice for anyone who is starting this sport .
Make sure you play smoothly for the first time and make sure you wear football boots when you 're playing on the pitch .
This advice is to avoid you injuring yourself as a beginner at football .
I 've been playing tennis for 5 years now and I can assure you it 's one of the best sports any person can do !
Also , I love it because it takes my mind off my worries .
As well as that , tennis gives me the opportunity to keep fit and meet new people .
Since it 's not very easy at the beginning , if you are interested in taking up tennis you should persevere and practise at least twice a week .
All in all , I 've played many sports in my life , but tennis has been by far the best exercise for both my mind and my body .
I really get a lot of pleasure out of doing it .
My hero and my villain
Clown Bassie , on the other hand , is an actor in a TV programme for children .
After a live show , he made a little girl cry by shouting at her and then kicked her in the back .
Clearly , travelling in your own car is much more comfortable than on public transport .
These people believe that over the next few years we will see a severe decline in the number of people using buses , trains , trams , etc . to get to places .
In my opinion , this is disappointing for a number of reasons .
First of all , public transport brings us closer to other people .
By using public transport , we reduce our carbon footprint and help to save the Earth .
Furthermore , we also save time : as cities become bigger it becomes more and more difficult to park , which in turn leads to us wasting time looking for somewhere to park , or wasting money on expensive car parks .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport should be a necessary part of everybody 's life . We should use it every day to save the Earth , money , and time .
Directed by Tim Burton , the story is a retelling of the fantasy novel Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland .The film shows a young Alice troubled by a strange recurring dream , the loss of her beloved father , an unwanted marriage proposal , and the oppressive expectations of the society in which she lives .
Unsure of what to do , she chases a rabbit in a blue waistcoat , and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole from which she emerges in a forest , where she is greeted by many strange creatures .
There Alice will start an adventure where she must slay the evil Red Queen and restore the White Queen to power .
But we must not forget about the marvelous acting of Johnny Deep ( as the mad hatter ) and Helena Bonham Carter ( as the red queen ) , without them the film would n't be the same .
But what really makes it magical is the makeup and the costume design . They really managed to create something amazing with the appearance of the characters .
Firstly , I should say that life nowadays would be unthinkable without science .
In the century of advancing communications and technology , it is hard to imagine the world without medicine , astronomy , computers , and history .
Without its help , for example , we would have never realized where we have come from .
By using computers nowadays , it is very convenient to find the information you are looking for .
There is no secret for human beings today , because they have explored every place on the Earth .
They climb the highest mountains , dive in the depths of the oceans , and conduct dangerous experiments and all for the sake of science .
The present belief is that scientific research will solve all problems and do away with all difficulties .
That is why science is so important nowadays .
The obsession with knowing everything has led some of us to conduct dangerous experiments for which we pay with our lives .
With its help , we cope with different situations and that is why it is so fundamental to human existence and I think is not evil .
At some time or another , each and every young person must provide themselves with the necessary skills . " What can I do with my life ? " .
After all , a successful career is best measured by how satisfying you find it , and it 's easier to develop strengths and skills than to actually have to learn to find something interesting .
While we are studying , we may not think seriously about jobs .
But in a few years ' time our job will be one of the most important things in our everyday life .
When someone asks an adult " what do you do ? " ,
Work , for most of us , will be the defining aspect of life and , thus , of our identity .
Through our work , we find an identity , we can find status , intellectual stimulation as well as wealth , which enables us to buy comfort .
Our working identities can change over time , our identity and behaviour as a young graduate are different from those of the professional expert and from those of the senior leader .
Our ability to develop our identity is crucial to our ability to be successful in a range of career roles , we need to shed our old identity and add new elements .
We each have a picture of who we are and what we will / won't do in our heads . Once formed , our brains garner the evidence that it is a true picture and ignore evidence that suggests that it is not true .
So when people say ' I do n't do numbers ' , ' I do n't do detail ' ' I do n't do preparation ' , they believe it and make it true . '
I ca n't do sales ' becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy .
We can change our beliefs , actions and thus our identity through experimentation , practice and conscious self - discipline .
In an age when career progression may lead us into new environments and sectors , it is ever more important to challenge our sense of self and explore whether you can create ' a new you ' by changing the beliefs you hold about yourself and the world , in order to develop and expand your career options .
There are more than 200 old , abandoned , buildings in our capital city .
But most of them are about to be demolished by town planners .
Firstly , demolition is partly caused by how valuable the old buildings are considered to be .
Old buildings often do not provide opportunities to make any money . They only cost town planners a lot of money because they probably need to be renovated .
And on top of that , without public funds , there are too few people who show they care about the fate of historical buildings .
This might cause town planners to think there are not enough reasons to keep them .
After all , the factor with the most influence on the demolition of local buildings is the lack of public funds which make it possible to keep our old buildings , or at least a few of them , because these funds frequently accumulate money for projects like renovations .
Any form of public transport like a bus or a train is too much of an inconvenience , especially in a large city such as London .
Imagine going to work on a rainy day : you have one hand on your umbrella and the other clutching your bag , the wind is blowing mist on your face and a puddle of water is sprinkling tiny dots of wet dirt on your stilettos while you are making your way to a bus stop .
Indeed , the method by which a person goes from point A to point B can spell the difference between a good and a bad day .
Transportation is very important in our daily life and , in this modern world we live in , the very least that we expect from almost anything is convenience .
That is why most of us prefer to travel in our own car rather than by public transport ; not only because it keeps us within our own private sphere , it also keeps us dry when travelling on a rainy day .
Yes , we are willing to spend more in the name of convenience . We 'd rather pay a hefty price for gas than be inconvenienced on public transport .
So , when I came across this advertisement yesterday , I found myself thinking how wonderful it would be to apply for this job .
I believe myself to be a suitable person for this job , as I am a hard - working , reliable , cheerful , fun - loving person .
Those children are too old for babysitters now , but I love children and would really like to work with them again .
I believe myself to be a proficient cook , as I 've always cooked for my family at the weekends .
Two years later , we moved back , but I continued speaking both Dutch and English to my parents .
Thank you very much for your time . I hope you 'll consider me for this position .
Yours faithfully ,
It means that other people feel challenged and do n't want to fall behind and look like underdogs .
Without this stimulus , they might have been inactive .
On the other hand , an almost equal number of people may have a contrasting point of view .
They give examples of when the desire to become famous made people aggressive and ruthless .
I can illustrate my words with the example of military campaigns .
The desire of some countries ' leaders to become famous and to glorify their names as great commanders brought about wars and conflicts between countries .
Hundreds and thousands of innocent people may fall victim to the insatiable desire of such fame - seeking personalities .
So , all in all , we can not answer this question with " yes " or " no " because there is an almost equal number of examples that help to support the contracting points of view .
She checked the time , then decided to call Michael .
He 'll call later ' , she thought .
She wanted to surprise Michael with some delicious pasta and some rose wine .
The ride felt like an eternity .
She parked her car a few meters away from Michael 's office and walked up to it .
I 'm pregnant and we need to sort this out .
" I do n't know . " said the familiar male voice . "
You need to understand this . I 'll pay child support and help you with the kid , but I can not lose Susan " .
She could n't believe her ears .
Michael had been cheating on her .
Full of rage and disappointment , she opened the door and saw the woman sitting in Michael 's lap .
When she got home , she packed some of her belongings and drove to her best friend 's house .
She heard heavy footsteps on the stairs and buried her head deeper in the pillow .
I am very happy to see you all once again .
I am here today to deliver a speech to you about boycotting bullying .
These days , we see written on the walls , stop bullying .
Do we know the real meaning of the word bullying ?
Those who have been the targets of bullying can suffer from long - term emotional and behavioral problems .
Bullying can cause loneliness , depression , anxiety , and lead to low self - esteem and illnesses .
In conclusion , I would like to say that self harm , low self - esteem and bullying are all causes of destruction in our schools . We need to stop this .
Now to banish bullying from our school I ask all of you to take this oath : I make a commitment to take a stand against bullying . I will treat others with respect and kindness .
I will have compassion to not be a bully and the courage to not to be a bystander .
Michael was sitting on the garden bench , waiting for his mother to finish her work .
She was on the cold ground , lying like a dead body . Her son sat by her side , trying to wake her up .
He stopped when he saw the dark shadow walking towards him .
It was a man in his late thirties , very thin and with light grey eyes .
He raised his hand , which was holding a metal bar , covered in blood .
Michael had no time to scream , he was already lying on the floor by his mother 's side .
She was not dead , but in a coma , in a hospital .
He was in the same state as her for about a week after the drama , and had to live on his own for the years that followed .
He walked up to her room , where she was comfortably sleeping in her bed .
Tonight , she would be gone . He had already signed the papers . His choice was made .
He took a deep breath before leaning over her and kissing her forehead softely .
I am a twenty - year - old student in my second year at National University of Culture of Ukraine .
Also , I can play several musical instruments , such as : violin , guitar , drums and tambourine .
Furthermore , I love children very much . The reason could be that I have three younger brothers and one younger sister , so I am the eldest one .
However , I have no experience of working with children , apart from helping my parents with my brothers and sister .
But in the dance field I have a lot of achievements , such as victories in different competitions and festivals .
I am a very active and creative person with a desire to work .
And , of course , as required , I can speak English quite well and have a certificate that shows it .
In my opinion , my candidacy is suitable enough for this job , because I am a young person that has all the required skills and a lot of energy to work .
When I was in school I used to go to my grandparents ' home to have lunch because my parents were at work . I fondly remember my grandma 's great cooking skills that she still has to this day .
Those years I was very familiar with the smell of cheeseburgers , BBQ pizzas and kebabs .
By the time my high school years were done , and when I attended university , I developed a certain predilection for typical healthy Spanish food , unavoidably combined with less fast food due to the usual dinners with friends .
The main cause of that change was that I had to have breakfast , lunch and dinner in my college dorm 's dining room , which had amazingly good cooks . They 'd cook really good dishes such as cocido , garbanzos and paella .
If all of us used cars , the levels of pollution would be incredibly high .
Public institutions should encourage the use of public transport , especially trains as they use electricity and are less polluting than other means of transport .
Traffic is a really big problem in cities nowadays and only the use of public transport can make a significant difference to the quality of life in our cities .
If those who run public transportation systems hope to make them greener in the future , they 'll have to come up with solutions that are both energy efficient and effective .
My first degree gave me a good track record in physiology and anatomy , and the experience , as a biological sciences ' student and as a research fellow , allowed me to build a scientific way of thinking .
Furthermore , I have improved my skills in molecular , biochemical , bioinformatics and microscopic techniques , and I also would like to point out my high motivation to develop expertise in stem cells and pharmaceutical research .
I am interested in an English Course on which I can learn at my own pace .
First of all , I consider it very important to learn a second language and English is a very commonly used one around the world .
In addition to that , I graduated in Computer Science and there is a lot of information available in this language .
Finally , I have an interest in technology , the environment and science .
I live in a small village in the German region of Hesse , called Griesheim .
- One for paper ;
- One for bio waste ; and ,
- One for waste that can not be recycled .
The cost of the waste disposal service depends only on the volume of non - recyclable waste produced .
There are also public containers for glass and clothes all around the village .
Eventually , the citizen becomes part of a very meticulous recycling process by looking to the cost .
On the other hand , the city provides a punctual public transport system , which is very convenient .
Trams are available 24 hours and tram stops are evenly distributed ; it takes no more than 8 minutes to walk from one stop to the next one .
Cycling is another suitable option , if the weather allows .
He would only drag himself out of his house when he heard a new type of food had been created .
Jack lived with his mother , he had no job , and when she had told him to be independent , he only lasted one month before ending up in poverty .
He was really sad because the government was enforcing a law banning new types of food . This had become a huge problem because more Americans were getting diabetes .
One day , before this new law was established , a crazy scientist created a new waffle , " the great , furry waffle .
" This was an incentive for Jack to go out . He was sure that destiny had rewarded him with this blessing , because he had eaten ten hot dogs in a row , although he felt a bit sick after , he knew it was worth the try .
There was a bit of a problem in his plan : the new waffle was in Texas , and he lived in Washington .
He saw on his mum 's television that if he was the first person to try the waffle , he would get a bonus of a hundred bacon strips .
Jack bought a ticket for the earliest flight to Texas . Once he got off the plane , he ran through the landscape .
He liked the trend of everyone being fat in America . That way , he could fit in .
The scientist gave him " the great , furry waffle " and a lot of syrup .
Jack grabbed it and put it in his mouth . He could taste heaven in his mouth .
In a matter of seconds , he fell to the ground , choking .
Suddenly , a giant fish fell from the sky , causing him to spit out the hairball . Jack could not believe what he saw . The man riding the fish was Bugs Bunny !
Jack finally lost weight and lived happily ever after . The end .
Have you ever stopped to think that some standards exist in society that everyone knows and follows although some people do it unconsciously ?
These standards are called unwritten rules , which can be defined as unspoken rules imposed in each culture to make the population live more civilly ( Bob Greene , How Unwritten Rules Circumscribe Our Lives - Paragraph 6 ) .
In fact , since the beginning , the written rules have helped to create civilizations , while the unwritten rules have helped to maintain them , allowing life to be more harmonious .
For example , I can cite the importance of the unwritten rules in my own culture , the Brazilian culture .
There are some aspects and actions that everyone who lives in Brazil needs to follow , and those directly reflect the values of Brazilian culture .
One of the most important unwritten rules that you should follow in Brazil is related to vocal patterns .
When Olquin said that the situation and the environment define the correct tone of speech ( 1995 ) , he was talking about African American Communication , but he is also describing Brazilian communication at the same time .
Even though there is no definite consensus about the exact vocal patterns in Brazil , there are some facts about the extremes of them .
First , Brazilians feel uncomfortable when people close to them raise their tone of voice and continue speaking loudly for a long time , without having clear reasons .
It means that you want to transform the dialog into a monolog ; moreover , unknown people in the same environment as you frequently do not want to know about your thinking .
In Brazilian culture , if , during a conversation , a person speaks too low , the listener will assume that the speaker does not want to continue with the dialog or does not care about what you are saying .
In both the extremes of speech , loud and low , there is a violation of the values of good communication .
Therefore , when you are in a conversation , it is important to pay attention to comply with the unwritten rules of vocal patterns successfully .
As vocal patterns are considered so important for Brazilians , personal space is another unwritten rule that it is easy to see people using on the streets daily .
When you are in a space where you feel comfortable being around other people that you do not know , this space is your personal space .
And , it can change according to your degree of familiarity or intimacy with the other person .
In some countries , like the United States , whose respect of personal space is extremely important , the public and the intimate space can vary between 25 feet and touching ( Edward T. Hall ) .
In Brazil , there is also this difference between the public and the intimate space , yet the magnitude of this is not the same as in the U.S.
Although Brazilians have a shorter personal space in comparison with the United States , they are not tolerant of strangers invading it .
So , even though the distance between people is shorter in Brazil , both countries value the idea of maintaining a space that both people feel comfortable with , called personal space .
Although Brazilians usually do not worry about distance made by others , people from different cultures believe that Brazilians spend a lot of time looking at others .
For example , in some cultures , Brazilians can be considered rude by women because they like to keep constant eye contact , and for these women , this means a lack of respect or invasion of privacy .
In general , this supposition is not regarded as true for many people in our culture , since Brazilians believe that constant eye contact is one of the most important points to maintain a good dialog .
According to the article " Nonverbal Communication : Speaking without Words " , eye contact is important because " insufficient eye contact can create communication barriers " .
In fact , in Brazil , eye contact is prime , and you will be considered to be without interest in the speaker or that the speaker is bothering you if you do not give enough attention when you are talking to them .
The source of this rule is easy to identify , especially when parents are talking to their kids ; it is hard to get the kid 's attention exclusively , but the parents insistently repeat , " look at me when I am talking to you " .
Therefore , this interaction demonstrates that eye contact can have a strong influence on the cultural values of attentiveness and respect for the others ' opinion .
After being socially judged by society , we can perceive the direct influence of unwritten rules on our cultural values when someone breaks at least one of them .
In Brazil , the social rules like vocal patterns are reflected in the communication values , which can be decisive to maintain good communication .
Also , personal space is governed by rules that vary depending on the country , and in Brazil are considered small , but everyone there appreciates this cultural value .
Eye contact is another important cultural value which is used by Brazilians , meaning respect and interest in others .
As in Brazil , each country around the world has reflections of unwritten rules in the cultural values .
Respecting these rules is the first step to understanding them and avoiding some conflicts .
In addition , you should avoid judging cultural values of other countries based on unwritten rules of your own .
It was a rainy Monday afternoon and Michael was gazing out the window thinking about his life , when he saw his friend , John , dashing along the street .
- I 'm late for my piano lesson ! I really have to go , see you later - John replied , panting .
Michael had a chemistry test the next day , but he was n't in the mood to study and so he decided to call Alex , his best friend :
- To be perfectly honest , I do n't really like it there !
What about the one next to the shopping center ?
- Sounds great .
Michael grabbed his coat and crept out of his house in order not to wake up his parents .
He remembered that he still had n't studied for his chemistry test .
According to Ferguson et al ( 2013 ) , dietary nitrate ( NO3- ) supplementation , via its reduction to nitrite ( NO2- ) and subsequent conversion to nitric oxide ( NO ) , reduces blood pressure .
Thus , the induced vasodilation may affect both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after exercise .
Nevertheless , a study by The New England Journal of Medicine claims that only diastolic blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplement , since they did not find in their study a significant change to systolic blood pressure after nitrate supplementation in healthy volunteers .
Thus , the investment in research into the influence of nitrate supplementation should continue , the aim of which would be to improve sports performance and improve quality of life .
Importantly , serious changes in blood lactate levels were not found either .
It was assumed that beetroot juice would increase oxidation and would reduce lactate production .
Nevertheless , nitrate supplementation did not change the lactate level significantly .
Finally , it was confirmed that nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels , consequently reducing blood pressure .
Despite the present findings , more research is necessary to understand the effects of nitrate supplementation .
By this action , athletes may improve their performance as well as their quality of life .
Due to the fact that I am studying to become a teacher , I have some more knowledge about this subject than other people , because I am in the school classroom every day and I face the reality of it every day .
To begin with , I agree with you that technology sometimes makes the educational process easier and more pleasant in that students have no idea that they are broadening their knowledge .
Of course , I make use of a computer and projector during my daily teaching , because this is a pleasant and entertaining activity for children .
However , my objection is that interactive learning is not the only way for children to be educated .
The traditional educational process may sometimes seem to be boring and dull for children , but a teacher should be a part of this process as a guide .
Without teachers ' guidance , self - study may cause some problems for children , such as possible misunderstandings .
Networked educational content is not safe at all .
It is common for children to watch violent scenes .
Nowadays , young people graduate from universities , and come up with new and innovative ideas about the educational process , and so , the tradition will be updated in the following years .
To be more precise , new educational methods promote the students ' teamwork .
In other words , students have the opportunity to discuss with their classmates in order to solve a mathematical problem in cooperation or to talk about a subject .
Furthermore , when it 's necessary , good students can help their classmates to improve themselves .
In this kind of education , the teacher is only the guide who helps students to discover the information on their own .
In contrast , interactive learning may bring some advantages , but it can also make children antisocial , because they learn on their own without the need to be in school with other people .
This is bad , because it will be necessary to work as team in their future job and then they will face serious communication problems .
My personal opinion is this it is not sufficient to cover the education process .
This is a good option , especially during the summertime .
Also , this is a healthy way of getting fit .
One of these is athletics . "
Campo de Marte " is one of the few places in Lima where you can practise athletics professionally .
You can practise it in a semi - Olympic swimming pool , which is always clean and protected against the sunlight .
I strongly recommend young people to choose sports in which you can be part of a team .
This experience would teach you how to work with different kinds of people .
Dear Mr Wallis ,
Thank you so much for this opportunity . I am very grateful for everything .
I think English is , in fact , very important because , first of all , despite not being the most spoken language in the world , it is the official language in a large number of countries .
Most of the content produced on the internet ( 50% ) is in English and , last but not least , although learning English can be challenging and steals some of our precious time , we can see that it is also very valuable to learn and can also create many opportunities .
About the accommodation . We talked and decided that we would prefer to be with English - speaking families because of the great opportunity it is for everyone to actually test their speaking skills .
I was actually about to email you about the activities that are being planned .
Regarding the students ' preferences , they all love the outdoors , like parks and rivers , and they also love a good museum because of their thirst for knowledge .
All in all , anything that will keep them away from being bored and having nothing to do .
Concerning this amazing trip , I only have two questions left starting with the weather , considering your experience with the changes happening at this time of the year , and the second and last , about what type of clothes you recommend , which is of great importance primarily to our female students .
On the positive side , travelling by car is more relaxinjg because you do not have to rely on others to drive for you .
Actually , you have more freedom as to which roads to choose and you can have breaks whenever you feel a need for some time off the street .
Going by train , for example , you need to get to the next train station and , afterwards , from the destination train station to your final destination .
Often enough , you have to rely on other services , such as buses or taxis , to reach your destination .
On the other hand , using public transportation is good for the environment because the amount of gas , electricity and other materials used is a lot lower per head .
Furthermore , you have the chance to take a nap , do some work or watch TV while you are being transported .
Moreover , you can be lucky enough to avoid big traffic jams , especially if you are taking the train .
Avoiding traffic jams , construction sites , accidents and other obstacles you may be affected by may result in a shorter amount of time spent travelling .
As a conclusion , you could say public transport will have its uses even in the future . While going by car may be more comfortable from time to time , the reasons I stated above lead me to the conclusion that public transport is necessary .
It is popularly believed that the golden era of public transportation will end soon due to the heavy use of automobiles such as cars , cabs and vans .
On the other hand , travelling by car is getting far more popular than it ever was with the development of science and technology .
People who are based in rural and remote areas always prefer to use public transportation , according to researchers from Columbia University .
However , in some countries , public transportation is a nightmare because it has not been maintained by the governments properly . This is one of the main reasons which have led people to use personal vehicles rather than relying on public transportation .
Not only people in countries where there is poor public transportation , but also in the most developed countries , there is a great tendency to use cars instead of depending on public transportation .
Despite the fact that using cars is expensive , many people still prefer to use their own vehicles because it saves their valuable time .
Public transportation , on the other hand , takes a lot of time to travel from one location to another .
Higher power efficiency and linearity cause decreased power consumption , increased lifetime and reduction of interference channels .
The Class - E power amplifier satisfies those goals with linearity techniques .
Class - E power amplifier PAs work as a switch and can obtain , theoretically , 100% power efficiency . The Class - E power amplifier ( PA ) was introduced by Sokal in 1975 .
These PAs work as a switch and can obtain 100% Drain Efficiency , in theory .
However , in practice there are some limitations , such as switch on resistance and various power losses that prevent achieving 100% Drain Efficiency .
Secret agents have often been chosen as the main characters in stories and films , such as the James Bond ones , which managed to be really successful .
There could be a lot of reasons , like the idea of living in an adventurous way or doing things in secret . But in real life , what kind of person does a secret agent have to be ?
In the same way , a secret agent has to be able to take risks when required .
Therefore , bravery is very important : nobody needs a fearful spy .
A secret agent works undercover , so his most important quality is possessing great skill at lying .
